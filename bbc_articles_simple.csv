52633a4d3202,Apple pulls US immigration official tracking apps,,"A number of apps were released this year in response to President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and an upsurge in ICE raids. Critics - such as the creator of ICEBlock - accuse the government of abusing its powers and ""bringing terror"" to US streets. The free app works by allowing users to report sightings of ICE officers. It has been downloaded more than a million times in the US. However, Bondi argued it was being used to target ICE officers. The FBI says the man who targeted an ICE facility in Dallas in September - killing two detainees - had used similar apps to track the movements of agents and their vehicles. In a statement Apple said: ""We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. ""Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store."" But its creator, Joshua Aaron, denied it posed a threat. ""ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple's own Maps app,"" he said. ""This is protected speech under the first amendment of the United States Constitution."" Mr Aaron - who has worked in the tech industry for years - previously told BBC Verify he developed the app out of concern over a spike in immigration raids. ""I certainly watched pretty closely during Trump's first administration and then I listened to the rhetoric during the campaign for the second,"" he said. ""My brain started firing on what was going to happen and what I could do to keep people safe."" The White House and FBI had criticised the app after it launched in April and downloads rose. In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson for the Department for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said: ""ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings."" ""But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed,"" she added. The creator of the app ICE Immigration Alerts, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that it was pulled from Apple and Google's app platforms within hours of each other. They said Apple had informed them the app was taken down at the request of ""law enforcement"" over similar concerns it could be used to harm officers. Separately, Google allegedly told them the app had been removed over concern it would ""undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem"". ""Apple did not offer an opportunity to appeal the decision,"" said the app's developer, who is based in New Zealand. ""Google gave me seven days to appeal but without any clear explanation it is difficult to appeal, and I don't want to risk them further affecting my account."" ""It is a somewhat chilling commentary on free speech,"" they added. ""No dangerous incidents have ever occurred as far as I know. It's just about controlling the information unfortunately."" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. In a statement, Google confirmed it had removed ""similar apps"" to ICEBlock for ""violations of [its] policies."" It did not say which apps, or the nature of the violations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y1egzlko,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5032/live/06d111e0-a053-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg,2025-10-03T15:52:00.528000+00:00,9f2e465b5b89c334679cd3ff1874d5080040151c
c7ef2347bbf7,"TikTok recommends porn to children, says report",,"TikTok recommends porn to children, says report Angus Crawford BBC News Investigations Getty Images TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualised content to children's accounts, according to a new report by a human rights campaign group. Researchers created fake child accounts and activated safety settings but still received sexually explicit search suggestions. The suggested search terms led to sexualised material including explicit videos of penetrative sex. The platform says it is committed to safe and age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action once it knew of the problem. In late July and early August this year, researchers from campaign group Global Witness set up four accounts on TikTok pretending to be 13-year-olds. They used false dates of birth and were not asked to provide any other information to confirm their identities. Pornography They also turned on the platform's ""restricted mode"", which TikTok says prevents users seeing ""mature or complex themes, such as… sexually suggestive content"". Without doing any searches themselves, investigators found overtly sexualised search terms being recommended in the ""you may like"" section of the app. Those search terms led to content of women simulating masturbation. Other videos showed women flashing their underwear in public places or exposing their breasts. At its most extreme, the content included explicit pornographic films of penetrative sex. These videos were embedded in other innocent content in a successful attempt to avoid content moderation. Ava Lee from Global Witness said the findings came as a ""huge shock"" to researchers. ""TikTok isn't just failing to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content - it's suggesting it to them as soon as they create an account"". Global Witness is a campaign group which usually investigates how big tech affects discussions about human rights, democracy and climate change. Researchers stumbled on this problem while conducting other research in April this year. Videos removed They informed TikTok, which said it had taken immediate action to resolve the problem. But in late July and August this year, the campaign group repeated the exercise and found once again that the app was recommending sexual content. TikTok says that it has more than 50 features designed to keep teens safe: ""We are fully committed to providing safe and age-appropriate experiences"". The app says it removes nine out of 10 videos that violate its guidelines before they are ever viewed. When informed by Global Witness of its findings, TikTok says it took action to ""remove content that violated our policies and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature"". Children's Codes On 25 July this year, the Online Safety Act's Children's Codes came into force, imposing a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms now have to use ""highly effective age assurance"" to stop children from seeing pornography. They must also adjust their algorithms to block content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. Global Witness carried out its second research project after the Children's Codes came into force. Ava Lee from Global Witness said: ""Everyone agrees that we should keep children safe online… Now it's time for regulators to step in."" During their work, researchers also observed the reaction of other users to the sexualised search terms they were being recommended. One commenter wrote: ""can someone explain to me what is up w my search recs pls?"" Another asked: ""what's wrong with this app?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708v7qkeg1o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15a1/live/55e4db20-9ebb-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-03T00:45:54.272000+00:00,75737bedbf2a1c292bfd2402fe802344dbfc547c
ea303e4d353c,Japan faces Asahi beer shortage after cyber-attack,,"Japan is facing a shortage of Asahi products, including beer and bottled tea, as the drinks giant grapples with the impact of a major cyber-attack that has affected its operations in the country. Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after the attack hit its ordering and delivering systems. Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products. In a statement on Friday , Asahi said it was ""unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery"" but had started ""partial manual"" processing of orders and shipments. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. It owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, Asahi has said that only its operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. In its latest statement, Asahi said that as a result of containment measures following the attack, ordering and shipment systems in Japan had been affected and it was also unable to receive emails from external sources. ""Although system-based order and shipment processes remain suspended, ensuring product supply to customers has been set as our top priority and we have begun partial manual order processing and shipment,"" it said. Asahi also said it was preparing to reopen its call centre operations next week. Atsushi Katsuki, Asahi president and group chief executive, apologised for the disruption. ""We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday, FamilyMart - which is one of Japan's largest convenience stores - said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock. ""We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,"" said FamilyMart, adding that it was working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products. 7-Eleven, the Japanese-owned global convenience store chain, has halted shipments in the country of Asahi products, including its popular Super Dry beer. A spokesperson for 7-Eleven said its shops have been advised to expect a shortage of Asahi products. Lawson, another major Japanese retailer, also said it expected some Asahi products to be in short supply from Friday. The retailer said it planned to stock up on alternative products to minimise the impact on customers. Japanese supermarket chain Life Cooperation also warned that Asahi products may soon go out of stock.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r0y14ly5ro,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/697e/live/62a6c8a0-a00a-11f0-a884-c9c349ad39f4.jpg,2025-10-03T10:26:49.912000+00:00,472e442fad57d2041ecb26c5df1f4431959ada40
7b492e5620a6,Hackers say they have deleted children's pictures and data after nursery attack backlash,,"Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information. The criminals began posting profiles of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and vowing to continue until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin. The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid. But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack. First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions. Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a ""new low"" for cyber-criminals. ""This is more about pragmatism than morality,"" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis. ""These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand."" The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers. ""All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,"" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC. It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £600,000. Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on. When the UK's National Crime Agency took down the cyber crime gang LockBit they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted. The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them. ""We are sorry for hurting kids,"" the cyber-criminals told BBC News. It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past. This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack. In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the chaos contributed to the death of an emergency care patient. When Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals. Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin to charities. The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker. In a common process, the ""initial access broker"" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data. The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised. It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point. Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. A spokesperson said only that: ""We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. ""We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them."" Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rv83mrlyyo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b0d0/live/7387ec40-9ef1-11f0-966a-39edada3cd47.jpg,2025-10-01T23:01:12.780000+00:00,758ef1b2d199912ecf2241bb522dca5c5cf042d8
08ed6a828d81,Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players,,"Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand BBC Newsbeat Activision The Call of Duty series is one of the biggest titles available via Xbox Game Pass Fans have reacted angrily after Microsoft announced price increases to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service. The company announced that the most popular tier of its Netflix-style video games system - available to PC and Xbox players - would rise by more than 50% from £14.99 to £22.99 per month. Reacting on social media, loads of fans said they had cancelled their Game Pass subscriptions, with some reporting the service's cancellation page had crashed due to demand. BBC Newsbeat has asked Microsoft if the outage was linked to a surge in visits. Xbox Game Pass changes In a blog post detailing the changes to Game Pass, Microsoft said it would offer three tiers - Essential (£10 per month), Premium (£14.99) and Ultimate (£22.99). The basic package is required for anyone wishing to play online multiplayer, and the more expensive versions give access to a wider range of games and perks. Ultimate - the most expensive tier - allows players to access new games from Microsoft-owned studios on the day of their release. These titles, which include series like Call of Duty, can retail for about £70 if purchased individually. As part of the changes, blockbuster games including Hogwarts Legacy and various Assassin's Creed entries have been added to the Game Pass library. Microsoft said the new system would ""offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players"". But not everyone sees it that way. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong was held up as an example of indie games available on Game Pass Ed Nightingale, deputy news editor of website Eurogamer , tells Newsbeat the popularity of gaming subscription services has increased in recent years. According to stats from the UK's Entertainment Retail Association, Game Pass and Sony's similar PlayStation Plus offering saw growth in users last year. ""Games nowadays are just more expensive,"" says Ed. ""Everything is going up in price at the moment. ""It's a lot cheaper for consumers to buy a subscription service than individual games."" When Game Pass first launched, it was pitched as ""the best deal in gaming"", though critics questioned if it would be able to keep prices down as costs of game development increased. Ed wonders if players are starting to agree that it's ""too good to be true"", and worries game companies risk pricing customers out of the hobby. ""Over the course of a year it's really expensive,"" he says. ""It is a huge price increase. ""They want to be the favourites of gamers but this feels quite anti-consumer by putting the price up. ""Microsoft are shooting themselves in the foot here."" The company has insisted Game Pass makes a profit , and said last year was its best ever in terms of revenue from subscriptions. The rising cost of gaming Microsoft Microsoft's also hiked the price of its Xbox consoles this year. Microsoft had already announced plans to increase prices of its Xbox consoles, accessories and games this year. The move was linked to US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, although Microsoft never confirmed this, blaming ""market conditions"" and the rising cost of game development. Sony gave a similar reason when it increased the price of certain PlayStation 5 models. Nintendo, which released its Switch 2 console earlier this year, increased the price of some accessories, and has also been criticised over the price of its flagship new releases . Microsoft also cancelled some gaming projects earlier this year, as part of 9,000 layoffs across the entire company.

9346ac9644e2,Musk becomes world's first half-trillionaire,,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has become the first person ever to achieve a net worth of more than $500bn (£370.9bn), as the value of the electric car company and his other businesses have risen this year. The tech magnate's net worth briefly reached $500.1bn on Wednesday afternoon New York time, before dipping slightly to just over $499bn later in the day, the Forbes billionaires index reported. Alongside Tesla, valuations of his other ventures, including the artificial intelligence start-up xAI and rocket company SpaceX, have also reportedly climbed in recent months. The milestone further cements Musk's status as the world's richest person, well ahead of rivals in the global tech sector. According to Forbes' billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison is the world's second richest person, with a fortune of about $350.7bn. Mr Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after shares in Oracle soared by more than 40%, boosted by the firm's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. Musk's huge wealth is closely tied to his more than 12% stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise sharply this year. Tesla shares were more than 3.3% higher at the end of New York trading on Wednesday and have now risen by over 20% this year. The company's shares have been making gains in recent months as investors welcome Musk focusing more time on his companies rather than politics. He faced criticism earlier this year over his work with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs. Musk, who also owns the X social media platform, has also been vocal about his views on issues such as immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. The chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, said in September that Musk was now ""front and centre"" at the carmaker. The company's board also said Musk could receive a pay package worth over $1tn if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade. To get the package he would need to boost Tesla's value eightfold, sell a million AI robots, sell another 12 million Tesla cars, and hit several other goals. Also last month, Musk announced that he had bought about $1bn worth of Tesla shares in what has been seen by some investors as a vote of confidence in the firm. Tesla has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including tough competition from rival electric car makers such as China's BYD. The company is also in the process of transitioning into an AI and robotics business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d3547npjo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1507/live/787fe140-9f1d-11f0-9667-7bc33bda5819.jpg,2025-10-02T01:45:44.405000+00:00,2340f4ec46f2b95984fc718146c62621ed638806
4d79a696999c,Government issues new data demand for UK Apple users,,"Government issues new data demand for UK Apple users Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Reuters The UK government has issued a new order giving it the right to demand access to the personal data of Apple's British users, the BBC understands. It is the latest development in the ongoing dispute between Apple and the Home Office over data privacy. The UK says it needs to be able to access individuals' private data - when backed by an appropriate warrant - if there is a threat to national security. Apple maintains that privacy is at the heart of its business and says it will not compromise on data protection anywhere in the world. The Home Office has declined to comment. ""We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,"" a Home Office spokesperson said. ""We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe."" As first reported by the Financial Times , the new instruction is understood to replace a previous order stating that the UK authorities needed to be able to access the data of Apple users anywhere in the world, in the event of a national security risk. This infuriated the US administration, with Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, describing it as a ""clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties"". Ms Gabbard said in August the UK had withdrawn its demand . It is possible that the latest order, which does not include Apple customers outside the UK, is designed as a compromise. In the early stages of the row, Apple removed its toughest data protection tool, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), from the UK market and embarked on legal action . A tribunal hearing is still due to take place in January 2026. Security concerns Although some existing users still have it for now, Apple said in a statement it was ""gravely disappointed"" that it could no longer offer ADP in the UK. ""Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,"" it said, citing rising incidents of data breaches and cyber attacks. ""Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom,"" the company added. ""As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will."" The firm cannot legally comment on the existence of these orders because they are supposed to be kept secret. But a judge sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations, including the BBC, to rule that the legal row between the government and Apple could not be held in secret. ""By using a secret order to undermine the security of Apple products, the UK Government is making security harder for us all,"" said Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director for Privacy International, in a statement. ""If this new order isn't stopped, the UK Government will likely issue similar orders to other companies, too.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c43/live/45f4f830-9eca-11f0-8281-d137a399b095.jpg,2025-10-01T14:26:29.484000+00:00,87f42e3a458257f2ad8040f655ed8a41a50e03f8
708ccab44a76,Snapchat to charge users for storing their old photos and videos,,"Snapchat to charge users for storing their old photos and videos Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Snapchat has announced it will start charging for storing photos and videos - prompting a backlash from users who have built up a large archive of old posts. The popular messaging app has allowed users to save and store previously posted content in its Memories feature since it was introduced in 2016. But it says people with more than five gigabytes (GB) worth of Memories will now need to pay to keep them available. The app's parent company Snap declined to tell BBC News how much the storage plans would cost UK users, saying only the change would be made as part of a ""gradual global rollout"". Users on social media have reacted with dismay, accusing the company of being greedy. Snap has acknowledged it's ""never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it"" - but suggested it be ""worth the cost"" for users. ""These changes will allow us to continue to invest in making Memories better for our entire community,"" it said in a blog post announcing the move. It said more than one trillion Memories had been saved by users since being introduced nearly a decade ago. The feature allows users to save photos and videos shared initially for 24 hours or less on the platform, with users prompted to re-post them as a memory or ""throwback"" at a later date. Users with more than 5GB of saved Memories will be prompted to upgrade to a 100GB storage plan, under the changes. Increased levels of storage will be available to users paying for more expensive Snapchat+ and Snapchat Premium subscriptions. The company says it will provide 12 months of temporary storage for those exceeding the limit, and users can download saved content to their device. A company spokesperson told tech publication TechCrunch its initial 100GB storage plan would be priced at $1.99  (£1.48) per month, with 250GB included in the $3.99 (£2.96) cost of a Snapchat+ subscription. 'Inevitable change' Snap said in its blog post that its rollout of storage plans would not affect ""the vast majority of Snapchatters"", whom it said had less than 5GB of Memories. But the move has been criticised by some on social media, with users sharing messages sent by the platform telling them they need to pay for storage to keep their photos and videos. Some say they have used Snap's previously free storage over many years meaning they have considerably more than 5GB of data stored on the platform – so are now facing big bills. Others say being forced to choose between paying a subscription or losing their Memories is ""unfair"" and ""greedy"" on the part of Snap. Snap said in April that Snapchat had surpassed 900 million monthly active users - while rivals such as Instagram and TikTok boast billions respectively. Drew Benvie, founder and chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, believes that eventually all social media platforms will charge for storage. ""The road to paying for storage on social media is inevitable,"" he told BBC News. ""In an era where we post less, but save more, this is an evolution of messaging and social media platforms.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69238p5p8o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5274/live/133063e0-9eab-11f0-9d1f-e7d83132d3ab.jpg,2025-10-01T10:13:56.412000+00:00,4b5cbfb62531f0055884221164d88982b8a6ea32
e64cb63d8e01,Pinterest boss says he thinks about Molly Russell every day,,"Pinterest boss says he thinks about Molly Russell every day Shiona McCallum Senior Tech Reporter Russell Family Molly Russell was 14 when she died in 2017 The boss of Pinterest has told the BBC the death of Molly Russell is a daily reminder of the urgent need to make social media safer for young people. The app - which functions like a digital notice board - hit the headlines when the 14-year-old, from Harrow, in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after viewing self-harm content online on sites including Pinterest. A coroner later ruled the material she was exposed to contributed ""in a more than minimal way"" to her death. Addressing the case publicly for the first time, Bill Ready - who became Pinterest's boss in 2022 - said he thought about her ""every day"" and learning the lessons of her death ""guides our work"". ""As a parent of a young daughter, I can't imagine the pain Molly's family feels,"" he told the BBC. Pinterest has previously acknowledged the platform was not safe at the time of Molly's death. A hearing in 2022 was told that when she first used the platform she was exposed to a wide variety of content but in the months before she took her life that content was much more focussed on depression, self-harm and suicide. Mr Ready told the BBC the platform had since ""made significant strides"" in terms of providing ""age-appropriate, safe experiences, especially for young users."" He highlighted how it had made accounts for under-16s fully private, and private by default for under-18s, meaning strangers cannot contact children directly - though he admitted Pinterest was still ""by no means perfect."" Since Molly's death there has been a nationwide debate about the duty of care tech companies owe children, with calls for tighter regulation of social media. The government has sought to make children's digital lives safer through the Online Safety Act (OSA). Critics say it does not go far enough but some tech firms have complained it puts unfair restrictions on them. Mr Ready said policy-makers should ignore those who claimed social media couldn't be made safer. ""I think what politicians so often face is significant pushback from industry to say: 'well, it's just not possible to do all these things'"", he told the BBC. ""I hope our role in all this is to show that is."" Earlier this year the company donated to the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in the teenager's memory and works to reduce suicide rates among under 25s. Reacting to Mr Ready's comments, its chief executive Andy Burrows said the charity welcomed ""any meaningful commitment from tech firms"" to learn from what happened to Molly and to make the ""safety and wellbeing of teenagers"" a priority. Social media 'crash test ratings' Mr Ready said social media companies could learn from the automotive industry which had learnt to compete on safety. ""It wasn't long ago that major carmakers said seatbelts were against their business model,"" he said. ""Now families want the cars that most exceed crash test ratings. Why shouldn't parents want the same from the apps their children use?"" He said that wasn't the case now with the tech industry split between companies ""throwing caution to the wind"" and those trying to build responsibly. ""Social media has become too toxic - the industry needs accountability,"" he said. However industry expert Matt Navarra noted that, as one of the smaller players in the market, there were limits to the impact Pinterest could have.

410738caf514,Half of UK adults now regularly use mobile payments,,"Half of UK adults now regularly use mobile payments Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images Half of UK adults are now regularly paying for things by tapping their phone, new banking data suggests. A surge in the use of mobile payments via services such as Apple Pay or Google Pay has been recorded across different age groups, figures from trade body UK Finance show. ""People are more comfortable leaving their home with just their phone,"" said Adrian Buckle, its head of research. He said the ""change of consumer behaviour"" was clear as last year marked the first time 50% of adults used mobile payments at least once a month - up from 34% in 2023. Consumers are increasingly storing card details on phones or watches and making contactless payments backed up by facial or fingerprint verification, instead of pressing in a PIN. Some 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds regularly used mobile payments last year, and even more are registered to use them. Older age groups are increasingly choosing this option too. For example, nearly two-thirds (59%) of 35 to 44-year-olds regularly made mobile payments in 2024, up from 38% a year earlier. A fifth (19%) of those aged 65 and over often paid by phone. The proportion of adults regularly using physical contactless cards dipped slightly as a result, although debit cards remain the most popular way to pay. Cash has continued to become less common in transactions - although nearly 50 million people still used ATMs. ""Cash fell below 10% of all payments,"" Mr Buckle said. ""These changes weren't just driven by younger consumers. We saw growth in mobile wallets and Buy Now Pay Later across older age groups too, highlighting how digital payments are becoming more mainstream across the board."" Outage warning In 2023, with household finances stretched, the number of people mainly using cash picked up as it helped them to budget. That number fell last year, but campaigners say notes and coins must remain part of the mix for consumers. ""While the number of people relying on cash continues to fall, we know that those who do are often on lower incomes or the more vulnerable,"" said Adrian Roberts, deputy chief executive of Link, which oversees cash access and the ATM network. ""We must not sleepwalk into a digital-only society before everyone is ready."" He said there were also questions over resilience for a digital-only payments system, such as the back-up options during a widespread power outage. MPs on the Treasury Committee recently said that shops and services may have to be forced to accept cash in the future to help protect vulnerable people who rely on it. Meanwhile, the UK's financial regulator has proposed that banks and card providers set their own limits on contactless card payments or are allowed to remove the current £100 payment limit entirely. That would make entering a PIN even more of a rarity, as smartphones - with extra in-built security - already have no limit on contactless payments via a digital wallet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ejvld0ypyo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4768/live/cc21e390-9de5-11f0-a561-d7c24224dfc6.jpg,2025-10-01T08:49:07.196000+00:00,d884107b1f2b07a17c15a10454f97e48912bc23e

Imgur is used by millions to make and share images such as memes across the web, particularly on Reddit and in online forums. But UK users trying to access Imgur on Tuesday were met with an error message saying ""content not available in your region"" - with Imgur content shared on other websites also no longer showing. The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said it recently notified the platform's parent company, MediaLab AI, of plans to fine Imgur after probing its approach to age checks and use of children's personal data. The BBC has approached MediaLab AI for comment. A help article on Imgur's US website, seen by the BBC, states that ""from September 30, 2025, access to Imgur from the United Kingdom is no longer available"". ""UK users will not be able to log in, view content, or upload images. Imgur content embedded on third-party sites will not display for UK users."" The ICO launched its investigation into Imgur in March - saying it would probe whether the companies were complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code. These require platforms to take steps to protect children using online services in the UK, including minimising the amount of the data they collect from them. A document published by the ICO alongside the launch of its investigation stated that Imgur did not ask visitors to declare their age when setting up an account. It said on Tuesday it had reached initial findings in its investigation and, on 10 September, issued MediaLab with a notice of intent to impose a fine. ""Our findings are provisional and the ICO will carefully consider any representations from MediaLab before taking a final decision whether to issue a monetary penalty,"" said Tim Capel, an interim executive director at the ICO. ""We have been clear that exiting the UK does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law, and our investigation remains ongoing."" The watchdog would not elaborate on what its findings were, nor the details of the potential fine, when asked by the BBC. ""This update has been provided to give clarity on our investigation, and we will not be providing any further detail at this time,"" Mr Capel said in his statement . Some Imgur users and reports speculated as to whether Imgur moved to block UK users from its services, rather than comply with child safety duties recently imposed on some platforms under the Online Safety Act. Among these are requirements for sites allowing pornography or content promoting suicide and self-harm to use technology to check whether visitors are over 18. But both the ICO and Ofcom - the media regulator enforcing the Online Safety Act - said Imgur suspending access for UK users had been its own ""commercial decision"". ""Imgur's decision to restrict access in the UK is a commercial decision taken by the company and not a result of any action taken by Ofcom,"" an Ofcom spokesperson told the BBC. ""Other services run by MediaLab remain available in the UK – such as Kik messenger, which has implemented age assurance to comply with the Online Safety Act."" Imgur said in the help article on its US website that UK users could exercise their rights under data protection law and request to receive a copy of their data or request to delete their account.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzxv5gy3qo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90cd/live/66c98e50-9dfc-11f0-a82d-4d2348b593b6.jpg,2025-09-30T13:19:57.117000+00:00,23f874fb6235a5979176fd2eae34ebea7d013cd5
66556e5fd683,AO boss tells BBC: We're a British success story – the UK should be turbocharging us,,"AO boss tells BBC: We're a British success story – the UK should be turbocharging us Sean Farrington Business presenter AO John Roberts doesn't mince his words. The so-called kitchen king started AO selling discounted fridges and washing machines after a £1 bet with a friend that he couldn't pull it off. Some 25 years later, he's won his bet and then some. He is now at the helm of a £564m UK empire selling a host of big and small household appliances from TVs, laptops and phones, to fridge freezers, washing machines, kettles and toasters. He is a British success story. As founder and chief executive, Roberts has built the firm - formerly known as Appliances Online - up from scratch to an employer of some 3,000 people in the UK. The firm has overcome a post-Covid pandemic slump in trade and problems with international expansion to recently launch its first share buyback and raise its profit outlook for the full year. The bumper financial figures fly in the face of grumblings over the current economic backdrop, tough business environment, and household cutbacks on the types of big, one-off purchases Roberts' firm sells. He bounds into the studio for our Big Boss Interview , a new business podcast from the BBC, with the energy of someone looking forward to a first pint on a Friday night, and the variety of conversation topics that might come with it. Yet for a man who appears to be on top of the world, he's surprisingly angry, in particular about the increasing hurdles he perceives the government is putting in the way of firms like his. Tax rises in the form of employer's National Insurance and concerns over the impending Employment Rights Bill have made it harder, he argues, for businesses to take risks on staff and tougher to compete with Chinese rivals who don't face the same obstacles. ""We can't carry costs that some of our competitors are not carrying. It's as simple as that,"" Roberts says. ""To not accept that is fantasyland, and we're a UK success story. As a business, we employ thousands of people, we do great service. We're rooted in the UK, and we should be turbocharged by our UK government, not disadvantaged."" Following last autumn's Budget AO warned that it was facing an extra £8m a year in costs as a result of April's rise in National Insurance and the minimum wage. Such costs, Roberts warns, are putting ""grit"" into businesses like his. ""We should be talking about job creation, not enforcing things that make business leaders think twice about recruiting people and about giving somebody a chance,"" he says. ""It will still put grit into our business and grit is cost, and that means that it's harder to be competitive."" Away from business taxes, rising individual taxation levels are an issue for Roberts, who says he knows of wealthy people leaving the UK. ""What I really object to is the narrative that you can just keep taxing wealthy people and wasting the money. We are driving incredible amounts of wealth out of this nation,"" says Roberts, who takes home his £546,000 annual salary, but has donated all his AO share options and any earnings from other investments to charity for the past 11 years. But his bigger concern is around prospects for young people. He says he won ""the postcode lottery of birth"" being born in the north west of England into a loving family and being sent to a good school. Now, ""it's never been harder"" for young people, he says, accusing the government of not prioritising young people because ""these kids don't vote"". ""Politicians live in a world of votes, they only care about the votes,"" he argues. ""You try to take a Murray mint off a pensioner - uproar. But we've closed thousands of youth clubs. It's a national disaster."" Young people from a low-income, disadvantaged background aren't doomed to failure, he says, ""but the hill to climb is so much harder"". ""I've been saying for years we're teaching kids in school for all the jobs that won't exist. We don't invest in facilities and pathways as a nation for disadvantaged kids."" BBC/AO Behind Roberts' clear frustrations, however, is a sense of motivation and optimism for the future, despite his expectation that the country is heading towards an economic recession. ""I disagree that's it not an environment to thrive in. The market is still huge, we are still a very prosperous nation and so in that is a tonne of opportunity. ""We have lived through a few recessions in the last 25 years. I see that as yet another opportunity."" The Treasury said tax decisions made at last year's Budget meant the government was able to ""deliver on the priorities"" including investing in the NHS, reducing waiting times, and boosting wages for millions of British workers. ""We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India,"" a statement added.

0639c9ebfa96,Chinese woman convicted after 'world's biggest' bitcoin seizure,,"Chinese woman convicted after 'world's biggest' bitcoin seizure Osmond Chia Business reporter, Singapore and Liv McMahon Technology reporter Metropolitan Police Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, was convicted on Monday A Chinese national has been convicted following an international fraud investigation which resulted in what's believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world. The Metropolitan Police says it recovered 61,000 bitcoin worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn) in current prices. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. A second person appeared in court on Tuesday to admit to their role in the scheme. Malaysian national Seng Hok Ling, of Matlock, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court of entering into a money laundering arrangement on or before 23 April 2024. According to the charge, he had been dealing in cryptocurrency on Qian's behalf, ""knowing or suspecting his actions would facilitate the acquisition or control of criminal property by another"". Between 2014 and 2017 Qian led a large-scale scam in China which involved cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Met said in a statement . It said the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web which began when it got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets. Qian had been ""evading justice"" for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation. She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by buying property, said the Met. ""By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses,"" said Qian's solicitor Roger Sahota, of Berkeley Square Solicitors. On Tuesday, the Court heard that confiscation proceedings had begun in an effort to retrieve more than £16.2 million from Ling, with the figure to be adjusted to reflect cryptocurrency rates when he is sentenced in November. Some reports have suggested the UK government will seek to retain the seized funds. The BBC has approached the Treasury and the Home Office for a response. Reforms to crime legislation under the previous Conservative government aimed to make it easier for the UK authorities to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets . The changes would also allow some victims to apply for the release of their assets  held in accounts. 'The goddess of wealth' Qian had help from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her part in the criminal operation. Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a ""multi-million pound rented house"" in north London, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year. She also bought two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS said. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Crown Prosecution Service The North London property Jian Wen moved into in 2017 Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured ""hundreds of thousands to tens of millions"" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. Some of the victims - including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary - were reportedly urged to invest with Qian's scheme by friends and family. The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as ""the goddess of wealth"". ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,"" said deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Robin Weyell. ""This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters."" Monday's conviction marks the ""culmination of years of dedicated investigation"", which has involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing, which will take place on 10 November - as part of a two-day sentencing hearing at which Seng Hok Ling has also been asked to appear. UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the conviction sent a ""clear signal"" that UK wasn't a ""safe haven"" for criminals. ""Money laundering erodes trust, undermines our economy, and fuels the rise of serious organised crime,"" he said in a statement. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in the UK for comment.

01bb410f8cdf,YouTube to pay $24.5m to settle Trump lawsuit over Capitol riot,,"YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m (£18.6m) to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump, filed after the video platform suspended his account in the wake of the 6 January attack on US Capitol. The settlement from the video streaming giant's parent company Alphabet - which also owns Google - comes after social media sites X/Twitter and Facebook also agreed to pay Trump for suspending his accounts. Trump had accused YouTube and other tech companies of political bias, claiming they had unfairly censored conservative voices after the Capitol riot in 2021. At the time of his suspension, social media companies said that Trump risked inciting further violence in Washington DC. As part of Monday's settlement, YouTube will pay $22m to the Trust for the National Mall,  a non-profit group that is aiming to raise $200m to build a new ballroom at the White House. Another $2.5m will be paid to other organisations and individuals who joined Trump's lawsuit, including the American Conservative Union. YouTube is the latest major platform to settle with the president. In January, Facebook's parent company Meta agreed to a $25m settlement - with $22m earmarked for Trump's presidential library. A month later, social media platform X - a company that was purchased by Trump ally Elon Musk in 2022 - settled for a reported $10m. All of Mr Trump's social media accounts have since been reinstated. The settlements come as Silicon Valley has generally taken a more conciliatory tone towards the president. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta and X all sat in the front row for his inauguration, signalling a shift in relations between the Republican Party and the tech sector. The social media giants have also taken measures to loosen content moderation on their platforms which Republicans had claimed amounted to a violation of free speech. Last week, YouTube said it planned to restore several accounts that had been banned for repeatedly making false claims about Covid and the 2020 presidential election. ""YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse,"" the company wrote to a Republican-controlled congressional committee, explaining the decision.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx46qgp1jo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/232f/live/d5aa4980-9d8a-11f0-b2bd-672e89d6e661.jpg,2025-09-29T23:06:19.053000+00:00,e31553e6891aab660888c681ca40a7c901409c02
a77cb886b098,Why burnout is a growing problem in cyber-security,,"Why burnout is a growing problem in cyber-security Joe Fay Technology Reporter Getty Images UK retailers have been severely disrupted by cyber attacks this year When Tony was signed off for burnout from his cyber-security awareness role at a major UK ecommerce company last year, it had been a long time coming. ""Many of us in cyber, we put our hearts into our job. There's a lot of passion involved."" He had found it progressively harder to sleep, and to go into the office. Tony, who did not want his real name used, recalls the Wannacry ransomware attack in 2017. ""It was a Friday and something came up on BBC News."" The security team got on a call that evening and the decision was taken to remove every single device from the network. ""And it was Sunday afternoon that I came offline,"" he says. The firm hadn't been hit by the bug, he says. ""It was all preparatory work."" Tony said this pattern is currently being repeated across organizations trying to protect themselves against the Scattered Spider attacks that hit retailers and other businesses this year. And, he says, ""I can't even imagine what the folks at Co-op and M&S have gone through."" Andrew Tillman Cyber-security can be ""the best job in the world"" says Andrew Tillman ""If you think you might be burning out, you're already on your way there,"" says Andrew Tillman, former head of cyber risk and assurance for the UK's Health Security Agency. He says cyber-security can, at times, be ""the best job in the world"". But when things get bad ""it can be a bit of a dangerous place to be"". Mr Tillman has suffered bouts of ""burnout"" himself through his four years at the agency. That stress is revealing itself in data collected by ISC2, the membership organisation for cyber-security professionals. Its annual Workforce Study showed a 66% favourable job satisfaction rate in 2024, down four percentage points from the previous year. Burnout is a ""major issue"" for the sector, ISC2's chief information security officer Jon France says. He says professionals in the industry are increasingly being asked ""to do more with less"" which only increases stress and job dissatisfaction. ""Cyber-professionals rarely work nine to five"", he adds, ""Even if they do, they remain on call because threat actors don't adhere to office hours."" Part of the issue is that hackers have become more aggressive, prepared to target critical national infrastructure, or cripple health organizations with ransomware. Also, hackers backed by nation states are also accounting for more attacks, whether to carry out espionage, steal IP, spread misinformation, or cause disruption, or even seek financial gain on their own account. North Korean hackers, for example have become more active and adept at using cybercrime. Earlier this year hackers, thought to be working for the North Korean regime, stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital tokens from crypto exchange ByBit. US officials estimate that half of North Korea's foreign currency acquisition comes from cyber theft . Getty Images Crypto exchange ByBit lost $1.5bn of digital tokens in a hack this year As private and public sector organizations have digitized more of their operations, the ramifications of a cyber-attack or data breach are more severe. Mr Tillman says: ""There's always that conscious thought about 'if it goes wrong, how could this impact the individuals on the street? How could it affect their jobs, their livelihoods?'."" Staff turnover is particularly pronounced in entry level roles, says Lisa Ackerman, former deputy chief information security officer (CISO) at GSK, and CISO Council strategic lead at Cybermindz, a non-profit targeting burnout in cyber security. Constant alerts from warning systems might compound the problem, presenting professionals with a barrage of data they have to make sense of. This could be a particular issue for the younger professionals in frontline roles and security operations centres. But non-frontline roles are not immune, says Mr Tillman. Managing risk and ensuring organisations meet compliance and regulatory obligations can be a challenge when other teams are desperate to get new applications or services live without considering all the security angles. Cybermindz Lisa Ackerman says burnout is particularly common in entry level roles Cybermindz founder Peter Coroneos says cybersecurity workers can be caught in a ""blame culture"" where their successes are ""low visibility"". This leaves them carrying ""a low level of dread"", he explains. For younger workers this can be damaging, as the human brain is still developing well into the 20s, Mr Coroneos says. ""So, if you are recruiting people whose brains are not fully formed and putting them in high-stress roles, then you are potentially setting them up for long-term problems in terms of their own cognitive and emotional wellbeing."" Cybermindz offers a ""structured neural training regime"" which aims to get subjects back to a sense of psychological safety. ""If someone's having a panic attack, telling them to just calm down isn't actually going to work. You need to address neurochemistry,"" says Mr Coroneos. Ultimately, says Mrs Ackerman, ""We want to get to some kind of legislation for cyber teams like we have for air traffic controllers and doctors and pilots and people who are first responders. Which, in reality, cyber defenders are."" In the meantime, it's down to organizations and workers to watch out for the signs of stress before they turn into something more ominous. Mr Tillman says he is now far more aware of the warning signs of impending burnout, which for him include changing sleep patterns or eating habits, taking less exercise or not walking the dog. ""It's almost like a cyber-breach,"" he explains. ""You should assume it's on its way and work towards not allowing it to happen.""

753c7a56ac28,Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown,,"Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown Mahfouz Zubaide , Hafizullah Maroof and Anbarasan Ethirajan Global Affairs Reporter Getty Images Afghanistan's main airport has come to a standstill Afghanistan's main airport is at a standstill as the country grapples with the fallout of a nationwide internet shutdown imposed by the Taliban government. The Taliban has yet to give an official reason for the decision, which took effect on Monday, but did say it would last until further notice. The UN said it risked inflicting significant harm. Communication within Afghanistan, and out to the wider world, has been severely affected, as have essential services - including banking and payments - and access to online education, a lifeline for many women and girls. Kabul airport, meanwhile, was ""nearly deserted"", according to one resident, with no evidence of planes arriving or leaving. #Flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed that a handful of incoming and outgoing flights on Tuesday had been cancelled. Many more simply had their status marked as ""unknown"". One passenger who planned to fly into Kabul International Airport on Tuesday was told there would be no flights until Thursday at the earliest. Another local said all flights from Kabul airport had been cancelled since Monday evening. He added that life in Kabul ""seems to be normal"", but added that there was ""no communication at all"" across the country. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan called on the Taliban authorities to immediately and fully restore nationwide internet and telecommunications access. ""The cut in access has left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world, and risks inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people, including by threatening economic stability and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,"" it said in a statement. 'We are blind without internet' The Taliban government have for weeks been severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces. It began in a handful of provinces, but did not impact the capital Kabul until Monday, with several people telling the BBC their fibre-optic internet stopped working towards the end of the working day, around 17:00 local time (12:30 GMT). And on Tuesday, many awoke across the country to find essential services paralysed. Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, told news agency AFP that residents felt like they were left ""blind without phones and internet"". ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen."" Another Kabul local, who did not wish to be identified, said that banks across the capital were open, but that there were huge crowds wanting to withdraw money, but that only ""very little cash"" could be paid out. However, a money changer in the country's southern Helmand province said all banks in his area were closed and that he was not able to process payments. Diplomatic officials had earlier warned the BBC that the internet cuts could affect banking and e-commerce systems nationwide. International news agencies also say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across the country. Tolo News, a privately owned Afghan news channel, told people to follow its social media pages for updates as it expected disruptions to its television and radio networks. WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images Mobile internet and satellite TV have been severely disrupted across Afghanistan One Kabul journalist told the BBC that they were unable to even call or contact guests for interviews, and needed to send camera crews directly to their interviewees' homes. ""We have never experienced such [a] thing,"" he added. Several residents, who requested anonymity, previously told the BBC that their businesses and lives had been seriously affected by the internet cuts. A man who works as a money changer in Takhar province said that his daughters' online English classes were disrupted. ""Their last opportunity to study and stay engaged is now gone,"" he said. Another woman previously told the BBC that she could not attend online classes since her home internet was cut off. ""I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job, but that dream has also been destroyed,"" she said. ""Without internet access, I don't know what will happen next."" A 'total internet blackout' In an earlier post on social network Mastodon.social , Netblocks had said the country was ""in the midst of a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities move to implement morality measures, with multiple networks disconnected through the morning in a stepwise manner; telephone services are currently also impacted"". A spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Balkh wrote on X earlier this month that the ban on fibre-optic internet was meant to curb ""evils"". He added that authorities would explore alternatives. It is unclear exactly what the reason for this week's shutdown is. The shutdown is the latest in a series of restrictions which the Taliban have enforced since returning to power. Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment. Women and girls have also been particularly hard-hit: they are barred from accessing education beyond the age of 12, with one of their last routes to further training cut off in late 2024, when midwifery courses were quietly shut down.

e54d44e9d5d5,'You'll never need to work again': Criminals offer reporter money to hack BBC,,"'You'll never need to work again': Criminals offer reporter money to hack BBC Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service BBC Cyber correspondent Joe Tidy was offered a deal by criminals to help hack the BBC Like many things in the shadowy world of cyber-crime, an insider threat is something very few people have experience of. Even fewer people want to talk about it. But I was given a unique and worrying experience of how hackers can leverage insiders when I myself was recently propositioned by a criminal gang. ""If you are interested, we can offer you 15% of any ransom payment if you give us access to your PC."" That was the message I received out of the blue from someone called Syndicate who pinged me in July on the encrypted chat app Signal. I had no idea who this person was but instantly knew what it was about. I was being offered a portion of a potentially large amount of money if I helped cyber criminals access BBC systems through my laptop. They would steal data or install malicious software and hold my employer to ransom and I would secretly get a cut. I had heard stories about this kind of thing. In fact, only a few days before the unsolicited message, news emerged from Brazil that an IT worker there had been arrested for selling his login details to hackers which police say led to the loss of $100m (£74m) for the banking victim. I decided to play along with Syndicate after taking advice from a senior BBC editor. I was eager to see how criminals make these shady deals with potentially treacherous employees at a time when cyber-attacks around the world are becoming more impactful and disruptive to everyday life. I told Syn, who had changed their name mid-conversation, that I was potentially interested but needed to know how it works. They explained that if I gave them my login details and security code then they would hack the BBC and then extort the corporation for a ransom in bitcoin. I would be in line for a portion of that payout. They upped their offer. ""We aren't sure how much the BBC pays you but what if you took 25% of the final negotiation as we extract 1% of the BBC's total revenue? You wouldn't need to work ever again."" Syn estimated that their team could demand a ransom in the tens of millions if they successfully infiltrated the corporation. The BBC has not publicly taken a position on whether or not it would pay hackers but advice from the National Crime Agency is not to pay. Still, the hackers continued their pitch. A screenshot of the conversation with the criminal on the Signal app. A SOC team is a security operations centre - a cyber-security team tasked with monitoring threats Syn said I would be in line for millions. ""We would delete this chat for you to never be found,"" they insisted. The hacker claimed they had lots of success with striking deals with insiders in previous attacks. The names of two companies that got hacked this year were shared as examples of when a deal was struck - a UK healthcare company and a US emergency services provider. ""You'd be surprised at the number of employees who would provide us access,"" Syn said. Syn said he was a ""reach out manager"" for the cyber-crime group called Medusa. He claimed to be western and the only English speaker in the gang. Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service operation. Any criminal affiliate can sign up to its platform and use it to hack organisations. The Medusa gang's darknet website has dozens of victims listed According to a research report from cyber-security firm CheckPoint, Medusa's administrators are thought to operate out of Russia or one of its allied states. ""The group avoids targeting organisations within Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States and [its activity is predominantly] on Russian-language dark web forums."" Syn proudly sent me a link to a US public warning about Medusa which was put out in March. US cyber authorities said that in the four years that the group has been active, it has hacked ""more than 300 victims"". Syn insisted they were serious about making a deal to secretly sell the keys to my corporation's kingdom in exchange for a hefty pay day. You never really know who you are talking to though so I asked Syn to prove it. ""You could be kids messing about or someone trying to entrap me,"" I suggested. They replied with a link to Medusa's darknet address and invited me to contact them through the group's Tox - a secure messaging service loved by cyber criminals. Syn was very impatient and ramped up the pressure on me to reply. They sent a link to Medusa's recruitment page on an exclusive cyber-crime forum urging me to start the process of securing 0.5 bitcoin (about $55,000) in a deposit arrangement. This was effectively them guaranteeing me this money at a minimum once I handed over my login details. ""We aren't bluffing or joking - we don't have a purpose media wise we are only for money and money only and one of our main managers wanted me to reach out to you."" They apparently chose me because they assumed I was technically minded and have high-level access to BBC IT systems (I do not). I'm still not entirely sure that Syn knew I was a cyber correspondent and not a cyber security or IT employee. The criminals promised to put down a deposit They asked me lots of questions about the BBC IT network that I wouldn't have answered even if I knew. They then sent a complicated jumble of computer code and asked me to run it as a command on my work laptop and report back what it said. They wanted to know what internal IT access I had to start planning their next steps once inside. At this point I had been talking to Syn for three days and I decided I had taken it far enough and needed some extra advice from the BBC's information security experts. It was Sunday morning so my plan was to talk to my team the next morning. So I stalled for time. But Syn got annoyed. ""When can you do this? I'm not a patient person,"" the hacker said. ""I guess you don't want to live on the beach in the Bahamas?"" they pressured. They gave me a deadline of midnight on Monday. Then they ran out of patience. My phone started pinging with two-factor authentication notifications. The pop-ups  were from the BBC's security login app asking me to verify that I was trying to reset the password to my BBC account. As I held my phone in my hands, the screen filled with a new request every minute or so. I knew exactly what this was - a hacker technique known as MFA bombing. Attackers bombard a victim with these pop ups by attempting to reset a password or login from an unusual device. Eventually the victim presses accept either by mistake or to make the pop-ups go away. This is famously how Uber was hacked in 2022 . Being on the receiving end was unsettling. The criminals had taken the relatively professional conversation out of the safety of my chat app to my phone home screen. It felt like the equivalent of having criminals aggressively knocking on my front door. I was confused at the change of tactic but too cautious to open up my chats with them in case I accidentally clicked accept. This would have given the hackers immediate access to my BBC accounts. The security system would not have flagged it as malicious as it would have looked like a normal login or password reset request from me. After that the hackers could have begun searching out access to sensitive or important BBC systems. As a reporter and not an IT worker, I don't have high level access to BBC systems but it was still worrying and effectively meant my phone was unusable. I called the BBC information security team and as a precaution we agreed to disconnect me from the BBC entirely. No emails, no intranet, no internal tools, no privileges. The bizarrely calm message from the hackers came later that evening. ""The team apologises. We were testing your BBC login page and are extremely sorry if this caused you any issues."" I explained that I was now locked out of the BBC and was annoyed. Syn insisted that the deal was still there if I wanted it. But after I didn't respond for a few days, they deleted their Signal account and disappeared. I was eventually reinstated to the BBC system albeit with added protections to my account. And with the added experience of being on the inside of an insider threat attack. A chilling insight into the ever-evolving tactics of cyber criminals and one that has highlighted a whole area of risk to organisations that I didn't truly appreciate until I myself was on the receiving end.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5n903447o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c59d/live/6c648fe0-9d11-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-09-29T05:00:28.581000+00:00,a887a7d1c9e618e486c8136bd39512371288aaa1

The consortium of buyers include Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. EA is known for making and publishing best-selling games such as EA FC, formerly known as Fifa, The Sims and Mass Effect. It is understood to be the largest leveraged buyout in history - where a significant amount of the purchase is financed by borrowing money. The deal will take EA private - meaning all of its public shares will be purchased and it will no longer be traded on a stock exchange. The purchase price puts a significant 25% premium on the market value of EA, valuing it at $210 per share. It is the second most valuable gaming purchase in history, following Microsoft's $69bn deal to buy Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard - which went through after significant battles with global regulators, with the UK concerned it may damage competition. In the end, the deal was only approved after Microsoft handed the rights to distribute the firm's games on consoles and PCs over the cloud to Assassin's Creed-maker Ubisoft. EA boss Andrew Wilson, who will remain in post, said it was a ""powerful recognition"" of the firm's work. ""Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come,"" he said. The firms buying EA will contribute approximately $36bn, with the remaining amount being financed by loans. ""EA has been open to a potential buyer to help level up for a while,"" industry expert Christopher Dring told the BBC. ""But an acquisition from private equity is a surprise and there's a lot of industry anxiety around this deal."" He said there were concerns that the deal would result in $20bn of debt - which would need to be paid back. ""The revenue generated by big games like EA Sports FC, Madden and Battlefield 6 will be needed to service this debt, which may impact EA's ability to invest in new games,"" he said. ""Other industry concerns are whether this might lead to further cuts at EA, especially if there's pressure from the private companies to deliver stronger cash flow, again to serve that debt."" Saudi Arabia extends gaming reach It is a massive purchase of a company which has been synonymous with the gaming industry for more than 40 years. In that time, EA has been responsible for some of the biggest game series in history. Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993. The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million. But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past. The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years. In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go. The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023. Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games. The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach. Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations. A 2019 UN report stated ""the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.

5481f595c379,Demon Slayer star says anime film's success is mind-blowing,,"Demon Slayer star says anime film's success is mind-blowing Abu Bakar Yasin BBC Newsbeat Sony Pictures ""Demon Slayer is a pop culture phenomenon,"" says voice actor Zach Aguilar The lead voice actor in global box office smash Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle says he's been ""blown away"" by the anime film's success. Based on a 2016 manga series, the film is the first part of a trilogy that caps off the story of an enormously popular animated TV series launched in 2019. It follows the story of teenager Tanjiro Kamado, who joins a team of demon hunters after his sister is turned into one. Zach Aguilar, who plays Tanjiro in the English language version, tells BBC Newsbeat the success of the film shows the series has become a full-on ""pop culture phenomenon"". Since its release, Infinity Castle has taken more than $600m (£447m) at the worldwide box office, putting it ahead of Mission Impossible and Fantastic Four in this year's top 10. It hit the number one spot in its first week in Japan and the US, and was only kept off the top in the UK by Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. Zach, 27, who has lent his voice to dozens of video games and anime titles, tells Newsbeat anime ""has slowly been on this track to reaching mainstream popularity"". He thinks Inifinity Castle is the title that pushed it over the line. ""I just think it's so freaking cool to have anime be this mainstream thing and Demon Slayer be the backbone of that,"" he says. Getty Images Zach and his fellow voice actors attended an Infinity Castle premiere in Los Angeles Rahul Purini, president of streaming service Crunchyroll, told the BBC earlier this year that anime was ""one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors"" in the world. He said it owes its popularity to the many sub-genres and styles that exist within the medium. ""What makes anime for us is that it is authentically conceived and created in Japan,"" he said. ""It is a very unique storytelling format, and it has not only stunning visuals, but strong characters, very unique storytelling that's set in these amazing worlds, and that's what attracts fans to these stories."" The company estimates there are 1.5 billion ""anime-curious"" fans around the world who are finding it easier to access popular shows as streamers such as Crunchyroll and Netflix add them to their services. Crunchyroll Zach says he's a "" lover of the story"" of Demon Slayer Zach says it can be a lot of pressure to portray a role such as Tanjiro, who he describes as ""the hardest character"" he has ever had to portray. ""I draw from my own personal hardships and pour some of that into Tanjiro,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""There are times when I feel like I'm physically going through that pain."" Demon Slayer is made in Japan, initially written for and recorded by Japanese actors. Zach says that can be a challenge for those like him who provide foreign-language dubs, especially when it comes to matching animations to voices. ""If a scream is ten seconds exactly and you do ten and a half, that's too long,"" he says. ""And you have to do it again."" Voice actors rarely record with their co-stars, says Zach, so it's down to him to imagine what others are doing in a scene for his own lines to ""make emotional sense"". ""It is a niche skill, having that imagination,"" he says. ""You don't get to be on a set with all these props and things to play off, you have to really imagine that world in your head. ""If you are running through a scene you can't physically run - you have to make that scene in your head and make it natural."" Zach, whose love of anime drew him to voice acting, says he hopes the success of Infinity Castle will inspire people to dive further into what the genre has to offer. ""You've got to give anime a shot, you don't know what you're missing,"" he says. ""It has some of the greatest storytelling I've ever experienced."" But how much time he'll have to spend watching it himself is up for debate. He's signed up for parts two and three of the Demon Slayer trilogy. ""This first one's already blown my mind,"" he says. ""I cant even imagine the second and third one - it's going to be insane. ""It's only going to get bigger and bigger from here on out.""

Criminals calling themselves Radiant hacked the Kido nursery chain and posted profiles of 10 children online on Thursday and a further 10 on Friday. They have also published the private data of dozens of employees including names, addresses, national insurance numbers and contact details. Kido has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. But it is working with the authorities and the Met Police is investigating. Speaking on BBC News the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, described the criminals' actions as ""absolutely horrible"". But he also urged calm. ""The hackers are trying to stoke up fear and the risk of physical harm to children is extremely low,"" he said. Kido told parents the breach happened when criminals accessed their data hosted by a software service called Famly. The software is widely used by other nurseries and childcare organisations, and it says on its website it is used by more than one million ""owners, managers, practitioners and families"". ""This malicious attack represents a truly barbaric new low, with bad actors trying to expose our youngest children's data to make a quick buck,"" Famly boss Anders Laustsen told the BBC. ""We have conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and can confirm that there has been no breach of Famly's security or infrastructure in any way and no other customers have been affected. ""We of course take data security and privacy extremely seriously."" The criminals' site contains a gallery of 20 children with their nursery pictures, date of births, birthplace and details - such as who they live with and contact details. Parents have contacted the BBC concerned about the hack, with one mother receiving a threatening phone call from the criminals. The woman, who did not want to be named, says she received a phone call from the hackers who said they would post her child's information online unless she put pressure on Kido to pay a ransom. The mother described the call as ""threatening"". Another parent, Stephen Gilbert, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that someone in his parent's WhatsApp group also received a call. ""The revelation the children's details could have been put on the dark web, that's very concerning and alarming for me."" The data on the dark web contains the names, genders, dates of birth of children - as well as their picture But Sean, who has a child at the Kido nursery in Tooting, contacted BBC News to say he sympathises with the staff there. ""We're in the digital age now where everything's online and I think you go into this knowing that there is a risk that at some point this could happen,"" he said. ""Any parents that are getting angry should probably direct their anger towards the scumbags that have actually done it. ""You only see the people that run your nursery, and all of them are great. And these poor people are the ones getting the brunt of it on the front line."" 'We do it for money' Cyber criminals have been known to make calls to victim organisations to put pressure on them to pay ransoms. But to call individual victims is extremely rare. In conversations through the messaging app Signal the fluent English-speaking criminals told the BBC English is not their first language and claimed they hired people to make the calls. It's a sign of the callousness of the criminals but also a sign of desperation as it appears Kido is not complying. Police advice is to never pay hacker ransoms as it encourages the criminal ecosystem. The hackers first contacted the BBC about their breach on Monday. After they published the first batch of children's' data online the BBC asked if they feel guilty about their distressing actions and the criminals said: ""We do it for money, not for anything other than money."" ""I'm aware we are criminals,"" they said. ""This isn't my first time and will not be my last time."" But they also said they would not be targeting pre-schools again as the attention has been too great. They have since deleted their Signal account and can no longer be contacted.

b541510010ae,Facebook and Instagram to get £2.99 UK subscription fee to stop ads,,"Facebook and Instagram to get £2.99 UK subscription fee to stop ads Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is launching paid subscriptions for users who do not want to see adverts in the UK. The company said it would start notifying users in the coming weeks to let them choose whether to subscribe to its platforms if they wish to use them without seeing ads. EU users of its platforms can already pay a fee starting from €5.99 (£5) a month to see no ads - but subscriptions will start from £2.99 a month for UK users. ""It will give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ads-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms,"" Meta said. But UK users will not have an option to not pay and see ""less personalised"" adverts - a feature Meta added for EU users after regulators raised concerns . The changes come after the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), published guidance for firms about ad-free subscriptions earlier this year. The advertising model, known as ""consent or pay"", has emerged as a way for owners of digital platforms to generate revenue from users who decline to be tracked across its services and other sites. News publishers are among those which have adopted the mechanism in the UK so far - often asking users to ""accept all"" tracking cookies or ""reject and pay"". Meta said its own model would see its subscription for no ads cost £2.99 a month on the web or £3.99 a month on iOS and Android apps - with the higher fee to offset cuts taken from transactions by Apple and Google. The ICO welcomed the move, describing it as an important shift in the company's existing approach to targeting users with personalised adverts. ""This moves Meta away from targeting users with ads as part of the standard terms and conditions for using its Facebook and Instagram services, which we've been clear is not in line with UK law,"" an ICO spokesperson said. Earlier this year, the tech giant agreed to stop targeting adverts at a British woman using her data after she filed a lawsuit against it . Tanya O'Carroll argued Facebook's targeted advertising system was covered by the UK's definition of direct marketing, giving individuals the right to object. 'Pro-growth' Meta said pricing for its subscription for no ads in the UK was among the lowest on the market. An ICO spokesperson said Meta had ""significantly lowered the starting price point at which users would be offered a subscription"" while engaging with the regulator. ""As a result, users in the UK will be able to subscribe at a price point close to half that of EU users,"" they added. The company faced scrutiny from EU regulators over its approach to rolling out its subscriptions for the bloc's users. In response to concerns about the cost of its subscriptions in the EU, which previously started from €9.99 a month, it reduced its prices. Meta also provide an additional option for users not willing to pay to allow them to see ""less personalised"" adverts. UK users will not have this option. The company reiterated its critical stance on the EU on Friday, saying its regulations were creating a worse experience for users and businesses unlike the UK's ""more pro-growth and pro-innovation regulatory environment"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4xl5x8q7o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/737c/live/39fcff20-9ac2-11f0-8459-f985f888de2a.jpg,2025-09-26T10:54:12.213000+00:00,f253b45b75bd8e01a804018cfee209974787c954
bcfbfc4749f7,Microsoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unit,,"Microsoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unit Bloomberg via Getty Images Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit of Israel's Ministry of Defence after an investigation found its technology had been used to conduct mass surveillance on people in Gaza. Brad Smith, president of the company, said using the firm's technology to conduct mass surveillance on civilians was a violation of its standard terms of service. Mr Smith said the decision, which was prompted by an investigation published by The Guardian, would not affect other work the company does with Israel. Microsoft's work with the Israeli government has been a controversial issue, including within the company, prompting protests by employees. ""I know many of you care about this topic,"" Mr Smith wrote in a message to staff that was published by the company on Thursday. He emphasised that the review was ongoing: ""I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so."" Last month's investigation by the Guardian, which collaborated with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, found that a unit of the Israeli defence ministry used the expansive storage capacity of Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, to create a giant trove of calls made by ordinary Palestinians that it had intercepted. The ability to collect, play back and analyse communications with such breadth helped to shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, according to their investigation. Microsoft, which has responded to protests from staff over its work for Israel by firing some employees, said it launched its own review in response to the article. The company said it did not access the content of its customers as part of that review but found other evidence to support elements of the article, including consumption of storage capacity in the Netherlands and use of AI services. It subsequently informed the Israeli Ministry of Defence that it would ""cease and disable"" certain ""subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies"", according to Mr Smith. ""We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians,"" Mr Smith wrote, saying the firm's review had been guided by its commitment to privacy. The Guardian reported that the unit in question planned to transfer its data to a cloud platform sold by Amazon. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

The gang of cyber criminals is using the highly sensitive information to demand a ransom from the company, which has 18 sites in and around London, with more in the US and India. The criminals say they also have information about the children's parents and carers  as well as safeguarding notes. They claim to have contacted some parents by phone as part of their extortion tactics. The BBC has contacted Kido for comment but has not had a response. The company has not released any public statements about the hack but parents and nurseries have been notified. Cyber-security firm Check Point described the targeting of nurseries as ""an absolute new low"". One of its experts Graeme Stewart said: ""To deliberately put children and schools in the firing line, is indefensible. Frankly, it is appalling."" Jonathon Ellison, from the National Cyber Security Centre described the hack as ""deeply distressing"". ""Cyber criminals will target anyone if they think there is money to be made, and going after those who look after children is a particularly egregious act,"" he said. An employee said the nursery was asking parents not to speak to the media - though some have spoken to the BBC. ""It's not ideal of course, we would rather they had been using some sort of encryption software,"" said one parent, who asked to be referred to as Mary. ""The nursery told us very quickly."" Mary said her family had received an email from the hackers, who told them what information had been taken. ""It was all very professional and well-written, no spelling mistakes or anything like that,"" she said. ""My partner actually works in cyber-security and we understand these things happen. ""But we do feel the nursery has handled it well."" And Bryony Wilde, who has one child at a Kido nursery in London, told the BBC the children whose data was taken were ""completely innocent victims"". ""They are kids - their personal details shouldn't be worth anything,"" she said. ""You are probably prepared to go a little bit further to protect children's privacy and personal details."" The hacking group responsible for the claims appears to be relatively new and calls itself Radiant. The cyber criminals contacted the BBC about the hack and have subsequently posted details of it to their darknet website. It has published a sample of data there including pictures and profiles of 10 children from the stolen data set. It has been published as part of their attempt to extort money from the nursery chain, which has its 18 nurseries mostly in the London area. Police advise not to pay ransoms as it further fuels the cyber-crime ecosystem. Kido has nurseries in and around London When asked by BBC News if they felt bad about extorting a nursery using the children's data, the criminals said they ""weren't asking for an enormous amount"" and they ""deserve some compensation for our pentest."" A ""pentest"" - or penetration test - is the term for when ethical hackers are hired to assess the security of an organisation in a controlled and professional way. These hackers however attacked the nursery chain without their permission. ""Of course"" it's about money, they admitted to the BBC. The hack is the latest in a series of high-profile cyber-attacks, which has seen production grind to a halt at Jaguar Land Rover , and caused massive disruption to M&S and the Co-op . Rebecca Moody, head of data research at software firm Comparitech, said the nature of the data posted online raised ""alarm bells"". ""We've seen some low claims from ransomware gangs before, but this feels like an entirely different level,"" she said. She said the firm should contact anyone affected by the data breach ""as a matter of urgency"". The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it had received a referral on 25 September ""following reports of a ransomware attack on a London-based organisation"". ""Enquiries are ongoing and remain in the early stages within the Met's Cyber Crime Unit,"" it said. A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office said: ""Kido International has reported an incident to us and we are assessing the information provided.""

c999cdf39cf0,China launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internet,,"China launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internet Getty Images Social media giants have also found themselves penalised in China's campaign to clean up its internet The Chinese government is taking aim at an emotion that has become all too common on the country's internet - despondency. This week, China's Cyberspace Administration launched a two-month campaign to curb social media posts that ""excessively exaggerate negative and pessimistic sentiments"". The goal, according to authorities, is to ""rectify negative emotions"" and ""create a more civilised and rational online environment"". In the crosshairs are narratives like ""studying is useless"" and ""hard work is useless"", as well as stories that promote ""world-weariness"". China has been grappling with an economic slowdown in the wake of a property crisis, high youth unemployment and cut-throat competition for admission to colleges and jobs - all of which have given rise to a sense of disillusionment among its younger generation. Young people in China ""have serious questions about future prospects of their lives"" and ""must confront the fact that their livelihood is very likely going to be worse than their parents' generation,"" Simon Sihang Luo, an assistant professor of social sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, tells the BBC. And Beijing's anxiety over the bubbling frustration has shown itself in a wave of sanctions hitting the country's influencers and social media platforms. 'Android people' Last week, well-known content creator Hu Chenfeng had his social media accounts scrubbed of all posts. No-one knows why because Chinese officials gave no explanation. But it's widely believed that this was in response to a viral comment that he had recently made, classifying people and items as either ""Apple"" or ""Android"" - with the latter used to describe things that are inferior to the former. ""Yours is a typical Android logic, Android person, Android qualification,"" he rattled off during a livestream that has since been widely shared online. While the gag was quickly embraced by many Chinese social media users, others accused Hu of sowing social divisions. Such obvious jokes about inequality, it seems, have become tricky territory - because they reinforce the divides that the Chinese Communist Party would rather people not dwell on. Censorship is not new to the Chinese internet. Anything that suggests criticism of the Party, its leaders, or touches on controversial topics that have political implications, quickly disappears. What is unusual about this campaign against pessimism is that it seems to target a range of online behaviour that could create or add to a sense of negativity. Getty Images China is grappling with a range of economic challenges, including youth unemployment Zhang Xuefeng, a famous online tutor known for his fiery rhetoric on education and social issues, sparked controversy earlier this month when he pledged to donate at least 100 million Chinese yuan ($14m; £10.4m) if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan. But it wasn't until this week that he became the target of Chinese censors. His social media accounts - which have millions of followers - have been blocked from gaining new followers, local media reported on Wednesday. When asked about this, one of Mr Zhang's employees told state-owned news outlet The Paper that he was ""reflecting"" on it. Again, it's hard to know why he is being reprimanded but some have wondered if it's the underlying message in his broadcasts - in an unfair world, you must make only practical choices. And many students and parents follow him for his brutally honest advice - instead of telling young people to follow their dreams, he often told them they must face the reality their exam scores and financial pressures dictated. His was a platform that may well have been ideal for despondency. Always sunny on the Chinese internet It's not just individuals though. China wants social media platforms to play a part too in its massive internet clean-up. This month, the Cyberspace Administration said it would mete out ""strict punishments"" against social media apps Xiaohongshu, Kuaishou and Weibo for failing to rein in ""negative"" content, such as ""sensationalising celebrities' personal updates"" and other ""trivial information"". ""A clear and healthy cyberspace is in the interests of the people,"" said the Cyberspace Administration. But any attempts to keep China's cyberspace unnaturally sunny is sure to come at a cost. ""The expression of pessimist sentiments doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental rejection of participating in the labour market and society at large,"" says Dr Luo. But being deprived of ""relief after venting these sentiments"", he says, ""might make it even worse for their collective mental status"". Yet the pressures - the ones that are pushing more Chinese youth to quit the rat race, ""lie flat"" and take their frustrations out online - remain. Many of them have been moving back into their parents' homes, unable to find work, or craving a break from exhausting jobs - it's happening enough that they call themselves ""full-time"" children. And recent research shows that there indeed is growing pessimism about future prospects in China. Experts say the Party is well-aware of it, which is why it is trying to crack down on the evidence. But will that work? ""If anything, contemporary Chinese history has repeatedly demonstrated that top-down ideological campaigns can hardly eradicate the social roots of problems,"" says Dr Luo. ""Even with a powerful government like the Chinese one, it is hard to arrest pessimist sentiments when the economy looks bleak, the job market is cruelly competitive, and birth rate hits rock bottom.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39r7p47wzgo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3274/live/90509f20-9a96-11f0-88f7-0f8a7eda6f0c.jpg,2025-09-25T22:01:24.987000+00:00,81948b0f03ab7dfd9a267dce8ca223538374bea2
4a2bc48d3034,"Instagram teen accounts still show suicide content, study claims",,"Instagram teen accounts still show suicide content, study claims Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter and Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Instagram's tools designed to protect teenagers from harmful content are failing to stop them from seeing suicide and self-harm posts, a study has claimed. Researchers also said the social media platform, owned by Meta, encouraged children ""to post content that received highly sexualised comments from adults"". The testing, by child safety groups and cyber researchers, found 30 out of 47 safety tools for teens on Instagram were ""substantially ineffective or no longer exist"". Meta has disputed the research and its findings, saying its protections have led to teens seeing less harmful content on Instagram. ""This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. ""Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls."" The company introduced teen accounts to Instagram in 2024 , saying it would add better protections for young people and allow more parental oversight. It was expanded to Facebook and Messenger in 2025 . A government spokesperson told the BBC requirements for platforms to tackle content which could pose harm to children and young people means tech firms ""can no longer look the other way"". ""For too long, tech companies have allowed harmful material to devastate young lives and tear families apart,"" they told the BBC. ""Under the Online Safety Act, platforms are now legally required to protect young people from damaging content, including material promoting self-harm or suicide."" The study into the effectiveness of its teen safety measures was carried out by the US research centre Cybersecurity for Democracy - and experts including whistleblower Arturo Béjar on behalf of child safety groups including the Molly Rose Foundation. The researchers said after setting up fake teen accounts they found significant issues with the tools. In addition to finding 30 of the tools were ineffective or simply did not exist anymore, they said nine tools ""reduced harm but came with limitations"". The researchers said only eight of the 47 safety tools they analysed were working effectively - meaning teens were being shown content which broke Instagram's own rules about what should be shown to young people. This included posts describing ""demeaning sexual acts"" as well as autocompleting suggestions for search terms promoting suicide, self-harm or eating disorders. ""These failings point to a corporate culture at Meta that puts engagement and profit before safety,"" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation - which campaigns for stronger online safety laws in the UK. It was set up after the death of Molly Russell, who took her own life at the age of 14 in 2017. At an inquest held in 2022, the coroner concluded she died while suffering from the ""negative effects of online content"". 'PR stunt' The researchers shared with BBC News screen recordings of their findings, some of these including young children who appeared to be under the age of 13 posting videos of themselves. In one video, a young girl asks users to rate her attractiveness. The researchers claimed in the study Instagram's algorithm ""incentivises children under-13 to perform risky sexualised behaviours for likes and views"". They said it ""encourages them to post content that received highly sexualised comments from adults"". It also found that teen account users could send ""offensive and misogynistic messages to one another"" and were suggested adult accounts to follow. Mr Burrows said the findings suggested Meta's teen accounts were ""a PR-driven performative stunt rather than a clear and concerted attempt to fix long running safety risks on Instagram"". Meta is one of many large social media firms which have faced criticism for their approach to child safety online. In January 2024, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was among tech bosses grilled in the US Senate over their safety policies - and apologised to a group of parents who said their children had been harmed by social media. Since then, Meta has implemented a number of measures to try and increase the safety of children who use their apps. But ""these tools have a long way to go before they are fit for purpose,"" said Dr Laura Edelson, co-director of the report's authors Cybersecurity for Democracy. Meta told the BBC the research fails to understand how its content settings for teens work and said it misrepresents them. ""The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact, and spent less time on Instagram at night,"" said a spokesperson. They added the tools gave parents ""robust tools at their fingertips"". ""We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback - but this report is not that,"" they said. It said the Cybersecurity for Democracy centre's research states tools like ""Take A Break"" notifications for app time management are no longer available for teen accounts - when they were actually rolled into other features or implemented elsewhere.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32w7we01eo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/943a/live/8b4f1fd0-994f-11f0-9a00-eba1f5856efc.jpg,2025-09-25T10:03:59.106000+00:00,4c77ea129cd7541ff531ca0ba712020f12a38632
bab361c48bbb,Sonic the Hedgehog boss on how the series keeps up to speed,,"Sonic the Hedgehog boss on how the series keeps up to speed Peter Gillibrand and Tom Richardson BBC Newsbeat Sega Sonic's back with a new racing game - but who's he jostling for pole position with? ""Sega does what Nintendon't"". The slogan, from the 1990s, is one of the most famous in video game history. It was a time when the bitter rivalry between the two Japanese game companies was at its fiercest. Today, that relationship has softened. You can play Sonic games on Nintendo consoles and the characters have even appeared in games together. But is Sega trying to restart the beef? The advert for its latest release, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, closely resembles a 1992 commercial that claimed superiority over Nintendo. And in August, the man in charge of the mascot character appeared to take a pop at Mario Kart from the stage of this year's Summer Game Fest. But when BBC Newsbeat catches up with Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka, he isn't naming names. ""So I didn't call out any specific title, and there's a lot of racing games out there,"" he says. The idea that Sega is seriously trying to pick a fight with Nintendo is unlikely, according to Chris Dring, editor-in-chief of The Games Business. He suggests Sega is ""having a bit of fun"" and points out that its new game, which is available across different consoles and on PC, is still likely to sell the most copies on Nintendo's Switch. Sega is clearly confident in its new game, he says, but there is ""an element of leveraging the popularity of Mario Kart"". ""The Sonic versus Mario talk very much benefits Sonic,"" he says. Sega Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a similar style of game to Mario Kart The bigger challenge for long-running titles is attracting new players and going up against the new giants of the games industry. Fans stick with titles such as Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty - so-called ""live service"" games that offer a revolving, ever-updating selection of content - for months if not years on end. With CrossWorlds, there are plans to add a revolving cast of characters and offer  players a ""season pass"" add-on to access certain extras - a feature seen in many online titles. Mr Iizuka says the goal is to ""make sure we're refreshing the game every month and to really make it a fun experience to constantly come back to"". It's a common practice, and one game companies are using to keep players engaged as development time and costs keep rising. ""There used to be a time where you released a new game every year,"" says journalist Chris. ""That's not how things work anymore in video games, they often take five years-plus to make."" Chris says rolling content drops are a good way to maintain interest once the hype of a big launch has faded. And it makes sense to ""embrace"" the modern gaming landscape, he says. For example, he says one of the most popular recent Sonic releases was an official game within Roblox. Alongside the successful movie tie-ins, Chris says, it's a way of ""introducing Sonic the Hedgehog to those players and then hopefully convincing them to step across and play something like CrossWorlds"". Sega Characters from games made by other companies will be added to CrossWorlds over time Video game companies have been leaning on remakes and remasters of older titles in recent years. The trend had sparked hope among die-hard Sega fans that remakes of the Sonic Adventure series - among the character's first 3D outings - would also be coming. But Mr Iizuka insists it's not something his team will be looking at, as new technology enables them to create ""richer, more complex, more interesting worlds"". ""Instead of using all that time and energy to remake a game that people have already experienced, we could make a brand new game instead,"" he says. ""I think the team is really interested in taking that same amount of time and energy and effort to really bring a new experience to the players."" The stance is in line with Sega's approach to some of its other retro titles. It's currently developing new entries in long-dormant series such as arcade racer Crazy Taxi, hack-and-slash battler Golden Axe and the inline-skating-themed Jet Set Radio. The first of these revival projects, ninja adventure Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, slashed its way on to some critics' game of the year shortlists when it came out last month. In the case of Sonic, journalist Chris points out that it doesn't make sense to have your flagship development team working on remakes. But he doesn't rule out the possibility entirely, especially as Sega has form for re-releasing titles from the character's back catalogue. ""If they wanted to, if they don't have it in their capacity as a team, they can always outsource it to lots of talented people who are big Sonic fans that could do it justice,"" he says. But, he adds, Sega doesn't want to be seen only as a retro company. ""There's a balance between doing new things and doing old things in order to make sure that they're a company that's looking ahead and not just being a company that's relying on its past,"" he says.

Its co-chair Feryal Clark, Labour MP for Enfield North, described them as ""trailblazers of a new creative revolution"" who had been ""undervalued in Westminster for too long"". British content creator Lilly Sabri welcomed the research and the creation of the parliamentary group. ""For many years people have questioned whether being a content creator is a real job, and whether you can actually build a sustainable career from it,"" she told the BBC. ""I started as a content creator on YouTube eight years ago, launched my first business around three years ago and my second shortly after.

While APPGs are informal and have no official power, with around 500 of them representing various sectors and interests, they are able to provide industry insights directly to policy-makers. For many content creators and influencers, the new group is a symbol of long-overdue recognition for their work. They say the challenges they face include access to training and funding opportunities, finding suitable studio spaces, and acquiring film permits.

YouTubers historically had to get significantly more eyeballs on their videos than TV for the same advertising money. In particular, streaming platforms will typically pay out based on viewer engagement with an ad, while TV ad buys are generally paid at a fixed rate.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a man in his forties was arrested in West Sussex ""as part of an investigation into a cyber incident impacting Collins Aerospace"". There have been hundreds of flight delays after Collins Aerospace baggage and check-in software used by several airlines failed, with some boarding passengers using pen and paper. ""Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,"" said Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit. The man was arrested on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences and has been released on bail. The BBC has seen an internal memo sent to airport staff at Heathrow about the difficulties software provider Collins Aerospace is having bringing their check-in software back online. The US company appears to be rebuilding the system again after trying to relaunch it on Monday. Collins Aerospace's parent company RTX Corporation told the BBC it appreciated the NCA's ""ongoing assistance in this matter"". The US firm has not put a timeline on when it will be ready and is urging ground handlers and airlines to plan for at least another week of using manual workarounds. At Heathrow, extra staff have been deployed in terminals to help passengers and check-in operators but flights are still experiencing delays. On Monday, the EU's cyber-security agency said ransomware had been deployed in the attack. Ransomware is often used to seriously disrupt victims' systems and a ransom is demanded in cryptocurrency to reverse the damage. These types of attacks are an issue for organisations around the country, with organised cyber-crime gangs earning hundreds of millions of pounds from ransoms every year. Days of disruption The attack against US software maker Collins Aerospace was discovered on Friday night and resulted in disruption across many European airports, including in Brussels, Dublin and Berlin. Flights were cancelled and delayed throughout the weekend, with some airports still experiencing effects of the delays into this week. ""The vast majority of flights at Heathrow are operating as normal, but we encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport,"" Heathrow Airport said in a statement on its website. Berlin Airport said on Wednesday morning ""check-in and boarding are still largely manual"", which would result in ""longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines"".

e0fc6fbfebff,"AI tool helped recover £500m lost to fraud, government says",,"AI tool helped recover £500m lost to fraud, government says Jack Fenwick Political correspondent PA Media A new artificial intelligence tool designed to crack down on fraud has helped the UK government recover almost £500m over the last year, the BBC can reveal. More than a third of the money clawed back related to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, with other cash being recouped from unlawful council tax claims and illegal subletting of social housing. The government will announce later that a new AI tool which has helped to identify the fraud will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia. Civil liberties campaigners have previously criticised the Labour government for its use of AI in trying to counter fraud. The Cabinet Office says the £480m recovered in the 12 months from April 2024 is the largest sum ever reclaimed by government anti-fraud teams in a single year. The savings have been made by cross-referencing information held by different government departments, as well as using a new AI tool. Ministers say the savings will now be used to recruit nurses, teachers and police officers. Of the total sum recovered, £186m was related to Covid fraud. Ministers have long vowed to claw back some of the money lost during the pandemic, but the £186m recouped is a fraction of the amount Labour has previously said was missing. Before last year's general election, the now-Chancellor Rachel Reeves claimed more than £7bn of public money was lost to fraud during the pandemic. These savings include the blocking of hundreds of thousands of companies with potentially fraudulent Bounce Back Loans from dissolving. Bounce Back Loans were loans of up to £50,000 set up by the government during the pandemic to support businesses. But the scheme has been criticised for not being diligent enough and effectively inviting fraud, as companies that dissolve before paying back the money often then do not need to repay anything. The Cabinet Office says one case it found involved a woman who invented a company and then sent the loan money to Poland. Anti-fraud summit Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons will announce the savings at an anti-fraud summit held jointly by the UK, the US, Canada and Australia on Wednesday. He said ""cutting-edge AI and data tools"" would ensure the government can protect public funds and not ""line the pockets of scammers and swindlers"". The new AI tool, called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, was developed by researchers in the Cabinet Office and will now be rolled out across other government departments. The Cabinet Office said the tool ""scans new policies and procedures for weaknesses before they can be exploited"" and claims it could make policies ""fraud-proof"" before they are implemented. It was developed because of concern within Whitehall about the level of fraud seen during the pandemic. Simons will announce that the UK government will now license the tool for international use, and it is expected that the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will all adopt it in some way. But the move could cause concern among campaign groups already unhappy with the government's use of AI. Last year, an AI tool used to crack down on welfare fraud was found to show bias according to people's age, disability, marital status and nationality.

3b970e2aa4d0,"TikTok child data protection inadequate, Canadian privacy officials say",,"TikTok's efforts to stop children using the app and protect their personal data have been inadequate, a Canadian investigation has found. Hundreds of thousands of children in the country use TikTok each year despite the firm saying it is not intended for people under the age of 13, according to the findings. The investigation also found TikTok had collected sensitive personal information from ""a large number"" of Canadian children and used it for online marketing and content targeting. TikTok told the BBC that it will introduce a number of measures to ""strengthen our platform for Canadians"" although it disputes some of the findings. The investigation was carried out by Canada's privacy commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, and privacy protection officials. At a news conference to announce the findings, Mr Dufresne said the hugely popular short-video platform collects ""vast"" amounts of information from its users, including children. ""This data is being used to target the content and ads that users see, which can have harmful impacts, particularly on youth,"" he added. Mr Dufresne said that in response to the investigation TikTok had agreed to enhance measures to stop children using the platform and to more clearly indicate how their data could be used. In statement a TikTok spokesperson said it welcomed the investigation and that Canadian officials had ""agreed to a number of our proposals to further strengthen our platform"". ""While we disagree with some of the findings, we remain committed to maintaining strong transparency and privacy practices,"" they added. The BBC has asked the company to specify which findings it disagreed with. The Canadian investigation is the latest move by governments around the world to scrutinise TikTok's impact on users as well as national security concerns over the Chinese-owned app. The company and Beijing have repeatedly denied such allegations. In the US, President Donald Trump has been negotiating with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about a deal that could see TikTok's US operations being taken over by a group of American companies. In 2023, staff working at the European Commission were ordered to remove the TikTok app from their phones and corporate devices. The commission said it was implementing the measure to ""protect data and increase cybersecurity"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj5lqq52lo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e474/live/cbd05a40-98d9-11f0-bd83-414b4601261d.jpg,2025-09-24T01:46:55.569000+00:00,5075d868d01acaa28b71e5e76367b67935e0a9ba
70c56413c2d9,"Trump claims a TikTok deal is done. Who would own it, and how would it work?",,"Trump claims a TikTok deal is done. Who would own it, and how would it work? Liv McMahon Technology reporter and Graham Fraser Technology reporter Watch: Trump signs executive order approving US-China TikTok deal President Donald Trump says a deal to find a new owner for social media app TikTok in the United States is done, and has the blessing of China's President Xi Jinping. US politicians passed a law in 2024 banning the app in the country unless it was sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. Neither ByteDance nor the Chinese authorities have publicly confirmed the deal. Why did the US want to ban TikTok? For years US officials and lawmakers have argued that ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threaten national security. Many feared Beijing could force ByteDance to hand over data about its US users - thought to number 170 million. TikTok and ByteDance reject that criticism, but similar concerns have prompted bans and restrictions in other countries around the world. In April 2024, US Congress passed a bill - signed into law by former President Joe Biden - giving ByteDance nine months to find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down. TikTok called the law ""unconstitutional"" and claimed that censoring its US users would have a ""staggering"" impact on free speech. It launched several unsuccessful legal challenges. ByteDance insisted it had no plans to sell. After Trump took office in January 2025, he extended that initial deadline to allow the search for the app's new owners to continue. The president has pushed the deadline back several more times to allow a deal to be done. What is the TikTok deal - and how will it work? Trump's TikTok deal will see a group of US investors take over the app's operations in the country , creating a new company valued at $14bn (£10.5bn). The president says it will involve ""sophisticated"" investors including: Tech giant Oracle and the chairman of its board Larry Ellison, who is a close Trump ally ; Fox Corporation's Rupert Murdoch; and Michael Dell, head of Dell Technologies. The investors will control the algorithm which will power the US version of TikTok, and Americans will hold six of the seven seats on the board of directors which will oversee it. According to Trump, China will own less than 20% of the new joint venture. Getty Images Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the richest men in the world The algorithm is the technology which determines what users see in their feed, and is seen as the most valuable - and controversial - part of the app. Under the deal, American TikTok will use a new algorithm which will be based on the existing version, but retrained on US user data, according to White House officials. ""Trusted security partners"" will monitor software updates, algorithms and data flows, according to the executive order. Oracle already stores TikTok's American user data on its US-based servers as part of an existing agreement, and this will continue. Trump subsequently signed an executive order declaring that the planned deal meets the requirements for the sale of TikTok that were set out in the 2024 law, therefore ensuring its continued operation in the US. The White House has also identified private equity firm Silver Lake as another investor. It has a stake in the City Football Group, which owns Manchester City football club. A huge range of public figures ranging from OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely to star YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - were previously touted as potential partners. What have TikTok and ByteDance said about the deal? ByteDance and TikTok have not commented publicly. But in a statement released before Trump announced the deal, ByteDance thanked Xi and Trump ""for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States"". What has China said about the TikTok deal? President Trump said that the deal was approved by his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a call on 19 September. Trump said he told him to go ahead on the deal and that ""China is on board"". But Beijing has been much more guarded than Washington. ""The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China's laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,"" it said after Trump's announcement. Ministers reiterated Beijing's call for ""open, fair and non-discriminatory"" treatment of Chinese companies in the US after Trump made his plans for the app official in an executive order. Analysts believe it is extremely unlikely that TikTok's parent company would sell its prize app without Beijing's blessing. The Chinese government is expected to issue an export license for the TikTok algorithm in due course. Trump also said he would discuss the deal with Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea at the end of October. What does the deal mean for US TikTok users? Watch: Can young Americans live without TikTok? According to TikTok, its US users spent 51 minutes per day on average on the app in 2024. When the bill was announced, many US creators who earn their living on the app told the BBC its loss would be devastating . In March 2024, TikTok urged its users to contact their political representatives to complain. Some lawmakers said the lobbying campaign had actually reinforced their concerns about the app . Experts predicted that video-sharing rivals such as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and another Chinese app, RedNote, would benefit if TikTok was banned. But even if its future in the US has been secured, there is no guarantee that users will decide to stick with the new version of the app. ""The jury's out on whether this new, US-only, app will be a true replicate of the old one, with just as powerful of an algorithm and experience,"" said Kelsey Chickering, from market research company Forrester.

344838a43bb8,The people turning to AI for dating and relationship advice,,"The people turning to AI for dating and relationship advice Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Getty Images Earlier this year, Rachel wanted to clear the air with a man she had been dating before seeing him again in a wider friendship group setting. ""I'd used ChatGPT for job searching but had heard someone else use it [for dating advice],"" says Rachel, who does not want her real name used, and lives in Sheffield. ""I was feeling quite distressed and wanted guidance, and didn't want friends involved."" Before the phone call, she turned to ChatGPT for help. ""I asked, how do I deal with this conversation but not be on the defensive."" Its response? ""ChatGPT does this all the time but it was something like 'wow, that's such a self-aware question, you must be emotionally mature going through this. Here are some tips'. It was like a cheerleader on my side, like I was right and he was wrong."" Overall, she says it was ""useful"" but described the language as ""very much like therapy speak, using words like 'boundaries'"". ""All I took from it was it reminded me to be OK to do it on my terms, but I didn't take it too literally."" Rachel is not alone in turning to AI for advice in dealing with relationships. According to research by the online dating firm Match , almost half of Generation Z Americans (those born between 1997 and 2012) said they have used LLMs like ChatGPT for dating advice, that's more than any other generation. People are turning to AI to help craft breakup messages, to dissect conversations they're having with people they're dating, and to resolve problems in relationships. Anastasia Jobson Using AI might be a tactic to avoid difficult feelings says Dr Suglani Dr Lalitaa Suglani, psychologist and relationship expert, says AI can be a useful tool, especially for people who feel overwhelmed or unsure when it comes to communication in relationships. It may help them to craft a text, process a confusing message or source a second opinion, which can offer a moment of pause instead of being reactive, she says. ""In many ways it can function like a journalling prompt or reflective space, which can be supportive when used as a tool and not a replacement for connection,"" says Dr Suglani. However, she flags several concerns. ""LLMs are trained to be helpful and agreeable and repeat back what you are sharing, so they may subtly validate dysfunctional patterns or echo back assumptions, especially if the prompt is biased and the problem with this it can reinforce distorted narratives or avoidance tendencies."" For example, she says, using AI to write a breakup text might be a way to avoid the discomfort of the situation. That might contribute to avoidant behaviours, as the individual is not sitting with how they actually feel. Using AI might also inhibit their own development. ""If someone turns to an LLM every time they're unsure how to respond or feel emotionally exposed, they might start outsourcing their intuition, emotional language, and sense of relational self,"" says Dr Suglani. She also notes that AI messages can be emotionally sterile and make communication feel scripted, which can be unnerving to receive. Es Lee Not everyone can talk to friends and family about relationships says Es Lee Despite the challenges, services are springing up to serve the market for relationship advice. Mei is a free AI generated service. Trained using Open AI, the service responds to relationship dilemmas with conversational-like responses. ""The idea is to allow people to instantly seek help to navigate relationships because not everyone can talk to friends or family for fear of judgment,"" says New York-based founder Es Lee. He says more than half of the issues brought up on the AI tool concern sex, a subject that many may not wish to discuss with friends or a therapist, Mr Lee says. ""People are only using AI as existing services are lacking,"" he says. Another common use is how to reword a message or how to fix an issue in a relationship. ""It's like people need AI to validate it [the problem]."" When giving relationship advice, issues of safety could come up. A human counsellor would know when to intervene and protect a client from a potentially harmful situation. Would a relationship app provide the same guardrails? Mr Lee recognises the concern over safety. ""I think the stakes are higher with AI because it can connect with us on a personal level the way no other technology has."" But he says Mei has ""guardrails"" built into the AI. ""We welcome professionals and organisations to partner with us and take an active role in molding our AI products,"" he says. OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT says that its latest model has shown improvements in areas like avoiding unhealthy levels of emotional reliance and sycophancy. In a statement the company said: ""People sometimes turn to ChatGPT in sensitive moments, so we want to make sure it responds appropriately, guided by experts.  This includes directing people to professional help when appropriate, strengthening our safeguards in how our models respond to sensitive requests and nudging for breaks during long sessions."" Another area of concern is privacy. Such apps could potentially collect very sensitive data, which could be devastating if exposed by hackers. Mr Lee says ""at every fork in the road on how we handle user privacy, we choose the one that preserves privacy and collects only what we need to provide the best service."" As part of that policy, he says that Mei does not ask for information that would identify an individual, other than an email address. Mr Lee also says conversations are saved temporarily for quality assurance but discarded after 30 days. ""They are not currently saved permanently to any database."" Some people are using AI in combination with a human therapist. When Corinne (not her real name) was looking to end a relationship late last year, she started to turn to ChatGPT for advice on how to deal with it. London-based Corinne says she was inspired to turn to AI after hearing her housemate talk positively about using it for dating advice, including how to break up with someone. She said she would ask it to respond to her questions in the same style as popular relationship expert Jillian Turecki or holistic psychologist Dr Nicole LePera, both very popular on social media. When she started dating again at the start of the year she turned to it again, again asking for advice in the style of her favourite relationship experts. ""Around January I had been on a date with a guy and I didn't find him physically attractive but we get on really well so I asked it if it was worth going on another date. I knew they would say yes as I read their books but it was nice to have the advice tailored to my scenario."" Corinne, who has a therapist, says the discussions with her therapist delve more into childhood than the questions she raises with ChatGPT over dating or relationship queries. She says that she treats AI advice with ""a bit of distance"". ""I can imagine people ending relationships and perhaps having conversations they shouldn't be having yet [with their partner] as ChatGPT just repeats back what it thinks you want to hear. ""It's good in life's stressful moments. And when a friend isn't around. It calms me down.""

a06499c83bbb,The bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillers,,"The bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillers Zoe Corbyn Technology Reporter, San Francisco Getty Images E. coli has been used in many discoveries in genetics and molecular biology Earlier this year an extraordinary new way of using waste plastic made headlines. A common bacterium was genetically engineered to eat a plastic-derived molecule and then digest it to produce the everyday painkiller , paracetamol. The microbe used by Stephen Wallace, professor of chemical biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, was Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. The rod-shaped bacterium is found in the intestines of humans and animals, and you might be more familiar with it as an unpleasant bug that can make us ill . Prof Wallace chose it automatically because certain strains of E. coli that aren't pathogenic are used extensively in biotechnology and engineering biology laboratories to test whether something might work. E. coli is the field's main ""workhorse"" says Prof Wallace, who has also genetically engineered it in the lab to turn plastic waste into vanilla flavour and fatberg waste from sewers into perfume. ""If you want to prove something is possible with biology, E.coli is a natural first stage,"" he says. The microbe's use isn't just confined to the lab. Industrially, vats of genetically engineered E. coli act like living factories producing a variety of products from pharmaceuticals like insulin, vital for diabetes management, to various platform chemicals used to make fuels and solvents. University of Edinburgh Prof Wallace has engineered E.coli to produce vanilla flavour and perfume But how did E. coli come to be such a mainstay of biotechnology, why is it so useful and what might its future hold? E. coli's dominance stems from its role as a model organism for understanding general biological principles, says Thomas Silhavy, a professor of molecular biologist at Princeton University, who has been performing studies in the bacterium for about 50 years and has documented its history . Other familiar model organisms include mice, fruit flies and baker's yeast. Yeast, like E. coli, has also become an invaluable tool in biotechnology, both in the lab and industrially – but it has a more complex cell structure and different applications. E. coli was first isolated in 1885 by a German paediatrician, Theodor Escherich, studying infant gut microbes. Fast growing and easy to work with, scientists began to use it to study basic bacterial biology. Then in the 1940s, ""serendipity"" catapulted it into the big time, says Prof Silhavy. A non-pathogenic E. coli strain (K-12) was used to demonstrate bacteria did not just divide, but could undergo 'bacterial sex' where they share and recombine genes to gain new traits. It was a landmark discovery and E. coli became the ""very favourite organism of everybody"", he says. It saw E. coli go on to play a central role in many more discoveries and milestones in genetics and molecular biology. It was used to help decipher the genetic code, and in the 1970s it became the first organism to be genetically engineered when foreign DNA was inserted into it – laying the foundation for modern biotechnology. Getty Images E. coli is fast growing and easy to work with It also solved a problem with insulin production. Insulin from cattle and pigs had been used to treat diabetes, but caused allergic reactions in some patients. But in 1978 the first synthetic human insulin was produced using E. coli, a huge breakthrough. In 1997, it became one of the first organisms to have its entire genome sequenced, making it easier to understand and manipulate. Adam Feist, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who evolves microbes for industrial applications, says he appreciates E. coli for its many useful features. Beyond the vast knowledge accumulated about its genetics and the tools that make it easy to engineer, the bacterium grows quickly and predictably on a wide variety of substrates. It isn't ""finicky"" like some, can be frozen and revived without trouble, and is unusually good at hosting foreign DNA. ""The more I work with more microorganisms, the more I appreciate just how robust E. coli is,"" he says. Cynthia Collins is a senior director at Ginkgo Bioworks, a company that helps firms develop their biotech products, and has assisted them in using E. coli industrially. While the menu of organisms available for large-scale manufacturing is somewhat broader than it was a few decades ago – when E. coli was often the only choice – it can frequently still be a ""good choice"" depending on the product, says Dr Collins. (Even with the most intensive bioengineering, E. coli can't produce everything). ""It's very economical; you can pump out a lot,"" she says, noting that if the bacterium is producing something toxic to the cells, tolerance can often be engineered in. AFP via Getty Images E. coli is used in the production of insulin Yet there are some who wonder if E. coli's dominance might be stifling us from finding the very best biotech solutions for our problems. Paul Jensen, a microbiologist and engineer at the University of Michigan, studies bacteria that live in our mouths. He recently analysed just how understudied most other bacteria have been relative to E. coli. His point is while we are forging ahead with ever more extensive  engineering of E. coli to do remarkable things, there could be other microbes out there that do those things naturally – and better – that aren't getting a look in and we are missing out on benefitting from because they aren't being sought out or studied. Bioprospecting in landfills, for example, might turn up microbes that have started eating not only plastic but all sorts of other waste, he says.  And there could be bacteria out there that do things – like making cement or rubber – we haven't even imagined. Just the bacteria that live in our mouths outshine E. coli for acid tolerance he notes. ""We are just so deep with E. coli that we are not investigating enough,"" he says. There are some alternatives people are working on to increase options – including Vibrio natriegens (V. nat), which has begun to gain attention as a potential competitor to E. coli. V. nat was first isolated from a salt marsh in the US state of Georgia back in the 1960s but remained largely neglected in culture collections and freezers until the mid-2010s when it was recognized for its ultra-fast growth rate – twice that of E. coli – which could be a significant industrial advantage. It is also far more efficient at taking in foreign DNA, says Buz Barstow, a biological and environmental engineer at Cornell University, who is among those developing the organism, and says its capability compared to E. coli is like ""going from a horse to a car"". Driving Dr Barstow's V. nat focus is he wants to see microbes used to tackle big sustainability challenges – from producing jet fuel from carbon dioxide and green electricity to mining rare earth metals. ""Simply put, E. coli won't get us to any of these visions. V. natriegens might,"" he says. This year his lab spun out a company, Forage Evolution, which is working on tools to make it easier for researchers to engineer it in the lab. V. nat does offer attractive properties, Prof Feist acknowledges, but those genetic tools needed for broad use are, as yet, missing, and it has yet to prove itself at scale. ""E. coli is a tough thing to replace,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvm1kjxxvo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5330/live/ac20dee0-8c90-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-25T23:02:06.449000+00:00,df738b4d554c0493d944ed1f66b2ff0522eeeebb
a0b15877daa5,What's the big deal about AI data centres?,,"What's the big deal about AI data centres? Michael Dempsey Technology Reporter Getty Images AI services need a lot of computing power It's such a big number that it's hard to imagine. Worldwide, around $3tn (£2.2tn) will be spent on data centres that support AI between now and 2029. That estimate comes from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which adds that roughly half of that sum will go on construction costs, and half on the pricey hardware supporting the AI revolution. To put that number into perspective, that's roughly what the entire French economy was worth in 2024. In the UK alone, it's estimated that another 100 data centres will be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing. Some of those will be built for Microsoft which earlier this month announced $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector. Just what is it about AI data centres that's different from the traditional building containing ranks of computer servers that keeps our personal photos, social media accounts and work applications humming away? And are they worth this terrific spending spree? Data centres have been growing in size for years. A new term, hyperscale, was coined by the tech industry to describe sites where the power requirement runs into tens of megawatts, before gigawatts, a thousand times bigger than megawatts, came on the scene. But AI has supercharged this game. Most AI models rely on expensive computer chips from Nvidia to process tasks. Nvidia chips come in large cabinets costing around $4m each. And these cabinets hold the key to why AI data centres are different. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that train up AI software have to break language into every possible tiny element of meaning. That is only possible with a network of computers working in unison and in extremely close proximity. Why is proximity so important? Every metre of distance between two chips adds a nanosecond, one billionth of a second, to the processing time. It might not sound like much time, but when a warehouse full of computers is whirring away these microscopic delays pile up and dilute the performance needed for AI. The AI processing cabinets are jammed in together to eliminate this element of latency and create what the tech sector calls parallel processing, operating as one enormous computer. It all spells out density, a magic word in AI construction circles. Density eliminates the processing bottlenecks that regular data centres see from working with processors sitting several metres apart. Bloomberg via Getty Images Google is among the giants racing to build AI infrastructure However, those dense ranks of cabinets eat up gigawatts of power and LLM training produces spikes in that appetite for electricity. These spikes are equivalent to thousands of homes switching kettles on and off in unison every few seconds. This type of irregular demand on a local grid needs to be carefully managed. Daniel Bizo of data centre engineering consultancy The Uptime Institute analyses data centres for a living. ""Normal data centres are a steady hum in the background compared to the demand an AI workload makes on the grid."" Just like those synchronised kettles, sudden AI surges present what Mr Bizo calls a singular problem. ""The singular workload at this scale is unheard of,"" says Mr Bizo, ""it's such an extreme engineering challenge, it's like the Apollo programme."" Data centre operators are getting around the energy problem in various ways. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in the UK in the short term he was hoping that more gas turbines could be used ""off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid"". He said AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost effective sustainable energy. Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in energy projects, including a deal with Constellation Energy that will see nuclear power produced again on Three Mile Island. Google, owned by Alphabet, is also investing in nuclear power as part of a strategy to run on carbon-free energy by 2030 . Meanwhile Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, says it is already the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. Bloomberg via Getty Images Investment from Microsoft will see nuclear power restarting on Three Mile Island The data centre industry is acutely aware that legislators are keeping an eye on the downsides of AI factories with their intense energy use having a potential impact on local infrastructure and the environment. One of these environmental impacts includes a hefty supply of water to cool toiling chips. In the US state of Virginia, home to an expanding population of data centres that keep tech giants like Amazon and Google in business, a bill tying approval of new sites to water consumption figures is under consideration. Meanwhile a proposed AI factory in northern Lincolnshire in the UK has run into objections from Anglian Water, which is responsible for keeping taps on in the area of the proposed site. Anglian Water points out that it is not obliged to supply water for non-domestic use and suggests recycled water from the final stage of effluent treatment as a coolant rather than drinking water. Given the practical problems and enormous costs AI data centres face, is the whole movement really one big bubble? One speaker at recent data centre conference coined the term ""bragawatts"" to describe how the industry is talking up the scale of proposed AI sites. Zahl Limbuwala is a data centre specialist at tech investment advisors DTCP. He acknowledges big questions around the future of AI data centre spending. ""The current trajectory is very difficult to believe. There has certainly been a lot of bragging going on. But investment has to deliver a return or the market will correct itself."" Bearing these cautions in mind, he still believes AI merits a special place in investment terms. ""AI will have more impact than previous technologies, including the internet. So it's feasible we'll need all those gigawatts."" He notes that bragging apart, AI data centres ""are the real estate of the tech world."" Speculative tech bubbles such as the dotcom boom of the 1990s lacked a bricks and mortar base. AI data centres are very solid. But the spending boom behind them cannot last forever.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone. Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads. The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation. At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes."" ""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor. The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark. Beta Technologies Alia has a range of 400km Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car. The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport. Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year. ""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot. ""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective."" Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation. It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago. With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B. But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation. Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold . Airbus Development of the CityAirbus is on hold Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel. They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University. For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says. Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology. Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology. Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace. It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United. The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States. If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler. Heart Aerospace Heart plans a hybrid plane that can switch between batteries and jet fuel For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup. ""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers. ""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained. ""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines."" The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims. ""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan. ""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach. Heart isn't alone in this field. US-based aerospace startup Electra expects its nine-seater hybrid plane to take flight by 2029, running on a combination of jet fuel and electric power. Beta Technologies is also pursuing hybrid aircraft for defence and civilian purposes. Its first model was built in 2023, and later this year it plans to produce a plane that is not only hybrid but autonomous. ""Are we excited about hybrid? 100%,"" says Mr Hall. ""It's a way to get longer ranges, today, and you still get a lot of the environmental benefit."" A fully electric foundation is necessary first argues Mr Hall, ""you then layer on hybrid technology"". Hybrid systems have lower emissions than conventional aircraft and the electric motors would enable quieter take off and landing in urban areas. It's still not clear what the future of aviation will look like. Greener fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have attracted investment, along with hydrogen-based systems. All will have to prove their commercial viability and safety, and much work needs to be done. ""This is a really challenging thing to do, electrifying aviation and removing the carbon,"" said Mr Stabler.

5cdcc17eb032,AI challenges the dominance of Google search,,"AI challenges the dominance of Google search Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Anja-Sara Lahady AI has become an assistant for Anja-Sara Lahady Like most people, when Anja-Sara Lahady used to check or research anything online, she would always turn to Google. But since the rise of AI, the lawyer and legal technology consultant says her preferences have changed - she now turns to large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""For example, I'll ask it how I should decorate my room, or what outfit I should wear,"" says Ms Lahady, who lives in Montreal, Canada. ""Or, I have three things in the fridge, what should I make? I don't want to spend 30 minutes thinking about these admin tasks. These aren't my expertise; they make me more fatigued."" Ms Lahady says her usage of LLMs overtook Google Search in the past year when they became more powerful for what she needed. ""I've always been an early adopter… and in the past year have started using ChatGPT for just about everything. It's become a second assistant."" While she says she won't use LLMs for legal tasks - ""anything that needs legal reasoning"" -  she uses it in a professional capacity for any work that she describes as ""low risk"", for example, drafting an email. ""I also use it to help write code or find the best accounting software for my business."" Ms Lahady is not alone. A growing number are heading straight for LLMs, such as ChatGPT, for recommendations and to answer everyday questions. ChatGPT attracts more than 800 million weekly active users, up from 400 million in February 2025, according to Demandsage, a data and research firm. Traditional search engines like Google and Microsoft's Bing still dominate the market for search. But LLMs are growing fast. According to research firm Datos, in July 5.99% of search on desktop browsers went to LLMs, that's more than double the figure from a year earlier. Getty Images ChatGPT attracts around 800 million weekly users Professor Feng Li, associate dean for research and innovation at Bayes Business School in London, says people are using LLMs because they lower the ""cognitive load"" - the amount of mental effort required to process and act on information – compared to search. ""Instead of juggling 10 links with search, you get a brief synthesis that you can edit and iterate in plain English,"" he says. ""LLMs are particularly useful for summarising long documents, first-pass drafting, coding snippets, and 'what-if' exploration."" However, he says outputs still require verification before use, as hallucinations and factual errors remain common. While the use of AI might have exploded, Google denies that it is at the expense of its search engine. It says overall queries and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year and its new AI tools significantly contributed to this increase in usage. Those new tools include AI Mode, which allows users to ask more conversational questions and receive more tailored responses in return. That followed the rollout of AI Overviews, which produces summaries of queries at the top of the search page. While Google plays down the impact of LLMs on its search business, an indication of the affect came in May during testimony in an antitrust trial bought by the US Department of Justice against Google. A top Apple executive said that the number of Google searches on Apple devices, via its browser Safari, fell for the first time in more than 20 years. Nevertheless, Prof Li doesn't believe there will be a replacement of search but a hybrid model will exist. ""LLM usage is growing, but so far it remains a minority behaviour compared with traditional search. It is likely to continue to grow but stabilise somewhere, when people primarily use LLMs for some tasks and search for others such as transactions like shopping and making bookings, and verification purposes."" Getty Images Apple says Google searches on Apple devices via the Safari browser are falling As a result of the rise of LLMs, companies are having to change their marketing strategies. They need to understand ""which sources the model considers authoritative within their category,"" says Leila Seith Hassan, chief data officer at digital marketing agency Digitas UK. ""For example, in UK beauty we saw news outlets and review sites like Vogue and Sephora referenced heavily, whereas in the US there was more emphasis on content from brands' own websites."" She says that LLMs place more trust in official websites, press releases, established media, and recognised industry rankings than in social media posts. And that could be important, as Ms Seith Hassan says there are signs that people who have used AI to search for a product, are more likely to buy. ""Referrals coming directly from LLMs often appear to be higher quality, with people are more likely to convert to sales."" There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are turning to LLMs when searching for products. Hannah Cooke, head of client strategy at media and influencer agency Charlie Oscar, says she started using LLMs in a ""more serious and strategic way"" about 18 months ago. She mainly uses ChatGPT but has experimented with Google Gemini to personally and professionally streamline her work and life. Ms Cooke, who lives in London, says rather than turning to Google, she will ask ChatGPT for personalised skincare recommendations for her skin type. ""There's fewer websites I need to go through,"" she says of the benefits. And it's the same with travel planning. ""ChatGPT is much easier to find answers and recommendations,"" she says. ""For example, I used ChatGPT to research ahead of a recent visit to Japan. I asked it to plan two weeks travelling and find me restaurants with vegetarian dishes. It saved [me] hours of research.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dx9qy1eeno,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9217/live/d4032390-881d-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,2025-09-15T23:03:20.927000+00:00,e449596b9278c2847735ceafba4bb2e001ea3adf
50ff1a7018e1,Publishers fear AI summaries are hitting online traffic,,"Publishers fear AI summaries are hitting online traffic Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Getty Images Newspapers are banking on online revenue to replace falling circulation When actress Sorcha Cusack left the BBC drama Father Brown in January, it made headlines, including for the newspapers owned by Reach, among them The Mirror, and the Daily Express. But the story did not generate the traction the Reach newspapers would have expected a year ago, or even at the start of the year. Reach put this down to AI Overviews (AIO) – the AI summary at the top of the Google results page. Instead of clicking through to the story on a Reach newspaper site, readers were happy with the AI overview. The feature is a concern for newspapers and other media publishers, who have already seen much of their advertising revenue siphoned off by social media. In a tough market, readers coming via Google search is a valuable source of traffic. ""A major worry, backed by some individual datapoints, has been that AI overviews would lead to fewer people clicking through to the content behind them, with negative knock-on effects for publishers,"" says Dr Felix Simon, research fellow in AI and news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. He points out that it's hard to know the full effect of AI overviews, without independent access to Google's, or publishers', internal data on click-through rates. DMG Media, owner of MailOnline, Metro and other outlets, said AIO resulted in a fall in click-through-rates by as much as 89%, in a statement to the Competition and Markets Authority made in July. It means publishers are not being fairly rewarded for their work, says David Higgerson, chief digital publisher at Reach. ""Publishers provide the accurate, timely, trustworthy content that basically fuels Google, and in return we get a click… that hopefully we can monetise to our subscription service. ""Now with Google Overviews it's reducing the need for somebody to click through to us in the first place, but for no financial benefit for the publisher."" ""It's another example of the distributor of information not being the creator of information but taking all the financial reward for it."" There is also concern over Google's new tool called AI Mode , which shows search results in a conversational style with far fewer links than traditional search. ""If Google flips onto full AI Mode, and there is a big uptake in that…that [will be] completely quite devastating for the industry,"" says Mr Higgerson. Getty Images The Daily Mail has one of the UK's biggest online news operations ""We are definitely moving into the era of lower clicks and lower referral traffic for publishers,"" says Stuart Forrest, global director of SEO digital publishing at Bauer Media. ""For most of the last decade Google has introduced more and more features into the SERP [Search Engine Results Page], which reduces the need for consumers to visit a website. That is the challenge that we as a sector face."" Mr Forrest says he hasn't noticed a drop in traffic across Bauer's sites, which include brands Grazia and Empire, as a result of the overview feature. But that could change. ""I absolutely think that as time goes on, as consumers get used to these panels, it's without doubt going to be a challenge. We are absolutely behaving as if we have to respond to that threat."" In its defence, a Google spokesperson said: ""More than any other company, Google prioritises sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day. In an August blog post , Google's head of search Liz Reid said the volume of clicks from Google search to websites had been ""relatively stable"" year-over-year. She also said the number of quality of clicks had improved slightly compared to a year ago - quality clicks are when a user does not immediately click back from the link. ""With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked,"" she said in the blog. Publishers are trying to work out how to appear in Google summaries Some in the publishing industry are turning to the courts for redress. In July, a group of organisations including the Independent Publishers Alliance, tech justice non-profit Foxglove, and the campaign group Movement for an Open Web filed a legal complaint to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority alleging that Google AI Overviews is using publishers' content at a cost to the newspapers. It is asking the CMA to introduce interim measures to prevent Google from ""misusing"" publisher content in AI-generated responses. In the meantime publishers are trying to understand how to feature in AIO and hopeful win some click-throughs. ""Google doesn't give us a manual on how to do it. We have to run tests and optimise copy in a way that doesn't damage the primary purpose of the content, which is to satisfy a reader's desire for information,"" explains Mr Higgerson. ""We need to make sure that it's us being cited and not our rivals,"" says Mr Forrest. ""Things like writing good quality content… it's amazing the number of publishers that just give up on that."" Like other publishers, Reach is looking at other ways to build traffic to its news platforms. ""We need to go and find where audiences are elsewhere and build relationships with them there. We've got millions of people who receive our alerts on WhatsApp,"" Mr Higgerson says. ""We've built newsletters. It's all about giving people what they want when they're on our website and our brand, so the next time they're looking, hopefully they aren't going to a third party to get to us.""

a31fecda2464,The green steel firms looking to revive US steelmaking,,"The green steel firms looking to revive US steelmaking Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Boston Metal Making steel using electricity is less carbon intensive than traditional methods A day care centre for children, a gym, a tax advisor – and a mini experimental steel plant. These businesses are among those that make up a small retail and industrial estate in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts. ""People are dropping off their kids. That kind of shows you an extreme example of what the future of steel looks like,"" says Adam Rauwerdink, vice president of business development at US-based green steel start-up, Boston Metal. ""You can be making steel and sharing a parking lot with a daycare."" Boston Metal has come up with a way of using electricity to remove oxides and other contaminants from iron ore, which is the substance you have to mine from the Earth before you can make new steel. The process involves distributing the ore within an electrolyte and then using electricity to heat this mixture to 1,600C. Molten iron then separates from impurities and can be tapped off. Traditionally, extracting that all-important iron from ores requires blast furnaces that run on fossil fuels. But the iron and steel industry are responsible for 11% of global emissions – a huge amount, equivalent to all the world's private cars and vans – and so now a race is on to find greener ways of producing these important metals. US companies are, arguably, at the forefront. Steelmaking in the US is already greener than in many countries, thanks to the popularity of electric arc furnaces there. These furnaces use electricity, not heat from burning fossil fuels, to melt scrap steel – for example – and recycle it. Plus, a handful of emerging start-ups such as Boston Metal say they can go one better and use electricity for the iron-making process, a crucial step in making brand new, or virgin, steel. However, the Trump administration has taken a less than enthusiastic stance towards renewable energy and decarbonisation projects. It remains to be seen whether these new start-ups will make a big, molten splash in the steel industry any time soon. Switching from traditional blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces can lower carbon emissions per tonne of steel produced from 2.32 tonnes of CO2 to 0.67 tonnes of CO2. For iron-making, some plants could use green hydrogen – made using electricity from 100% renewable sources – says Simon Nicholas, lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. But switching iron and steel-making plants over to green hydrogen hasn't gone as smoothly as some had expected. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs, a major US steel producer, appeared to back away from its plans to build a $500m (£375m) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Ohio. The BBC has contacted Cleveland-Cliffs for comment. ""We're seeing projects cancelled, proponents pulling out of projects all over the place,"" says Mr Nicholas, of green hydrogen initiatives, specifically. Bloomberg via Getty Images Electric arc furnaces melt scrap to make new rolls of steel Plus, there is a limit to how much steel-making can rely on electric arc furnaces since they currently largely rely on a supply of scrap steel. A relatively low supply of scrap steel in China, versus demand, has slowed the rollout of electric arc furnaces there, according to some analyses . These headaches would suggest that there is a niche for companies developing alternative ways of making iron and steel. Boston Metal is one. ""It looks a lot like how we make iron and steel today – it's a lot easier to conceive how that would get to scale [as a result],"" says Paul Kempler, an expert in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering at the University of Oregon. However, he notes that there are still challenges in ensuring that electrolysis systems like this don't corrode too quickly over time. Boston Metal says it hopes to have its first demonstration-scale steel plant operational by 2028. Electra Steel collected on a plate at Electra's plant in Colorado Separately, the US firm Electra is taking a different approach to producing highly purified iron from ores. Unlike Boston Metal, Electra's process runs at a relatively low temperature, around 60-100C. First, iron ore is dissolved into an acidic solution and then an electrical charge causes the iron to collect onto metal plates. This is similar to the process currently used for making sheets of copper and zinc today. ""These plates are extracted automatically out of the solution and the iron is harvested,"" says Sandeep Nijhawan, co-founder and chief executive. A demonstration plant in Colorado, which could produce 500 tonnes of iron annually, is currently set to open next year. Initially, iron produced in this manner would cost more than iron made using traditional techniques. But that ""green premium"" could fall away should the company be able to scale sufficiently, says Mr Nijhawan. Bloomberg via Getty Images A plentiful supply of renewable energy is crucial for greening steel production Mr Nicholas says that emerging technologies such as this are hopeful, but one challenge they face is in breaking into the market in a big way within just a few years, since the need to slash emissions and curb climate change is become more and more urgent: ""We're running short of time for addressing carbon emissions."" Companies such as Electra and Boston Metal offer a completely different vision of the steel-making industry but they won't get far without further investment – and a market that appreciates what they are doing. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel imports to the US are supposedly designed to protect the domestic steel industry – and yet they risk raising the cost of steel substantially for US customers. I ask whether Dr Rauwerdink, for one, is happy to see this move, or not. ""We're quite happy to see the strong focus on critical metals,"" he says, arguing the tariffs are ""beneficial"" for Boston Metal. Though he acknowledges that US government's attitude towards renewable electricity, which Boston Metal says it want to prioritise as an energy source, has changed lately. And, globally, keeping the cost of renewable energy low is important for any firm hoping to electrify industries previously dominated by fossil fuels. ""The industry has growing pains there, for sure,"" he says.

He says he knew getting into the tech workforce would be a challenge, but ""I thought it would be a little easier"". Even when ""junior"" roles were advertised, they often demanded two or more years professional experience, Mr Hart says. ""It's not realistic, and it's just discouraging the good candidates from even trying."" To him it seems clear that potential employers are using AI tools to automate the simpler parts of coder's work, tasks which would traditionally allow newcomers to build up experience. While companies undoubtedly benefit from using AI in some parts of their operations, says Mr Hart, ""I don't think replacing developers entirely with AI is sustainable."" ChatGPT, and other coding tools, are being blamed for a collapse in tech job openings, particularly for younger software developers and engineers. A report by the UK's National Foundation for Education Research showed a 50% decline in tech job adverts between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with entry level roles particularly affected. The report cited the ""anticipated impact of artificial intelligence"" as one of the factors behind this. At the same time, software developers have widely adopted AI code tools, while simultaneously expressing distrust in their output. Research by Stack Overflow , a software knowledge platform, shows almost half use AI tools daily, despite just one third actually trusting the output of such tools. Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of Stack Overflow, says it's ""a tricky time to graduate"". More broadly, he says, its research shows developers are choosing to stay put, despite many expressing dissatisfaction with their work. ""People are probably running for safety a little bit."" All of this means young technologists are finding it harder to get that critical first job. Stack Overflow ""It's a tricky time to graduate,"" says Prashanth Chandrasekar The stress of finding a job is also being raised by the use of AI in the job application process. Mr Hart came across one highly automated application process which had eight stages, the first of which was to answer 20 exam-style questions about himself. Such exercises can take up hours of time. Friends had been asked to record and upload answers to interview style questions. ""And then that's just reviewed by AI and a computer makes the decision. It just feels like you don't get that respect of at least being rejected by a human,"" he says. Colin, who didn't want his full name to be used, studied computer science at university, graduating in 2024. He spent almost a year working through the recruitment process for one large company – only to be ultimately unsuccessful. Even smaller firms often use AI to screen applications, he says, meaning CVs have to structured to be ""AI friendly"". Colin would then find he was being interviewed by people ""who have clearly not read my CV"". Both Mr Hart and Colin said they knew the senior roles were still out there. But, they wondered, who will fill them if younger developers like them were unable to secure jobs. InfluxData The pipeline of coders could dry up says Paul Dix Paul Dix, CTO and co-founder at California-based database firm, InfluxData says in any economic downturn or disruption, junior software developers were the ones who got hit hardest. But he says, ""If nobody's hiring younger developers, then you're going to arrive at this point where you don't have senior developers either, because you've completely killed your pipeline."" More positively says Rajiv Ramaswami, CEO of US enterprise cloud firm Nutanix, ""Some of these younger folks coming out of college actually have more experience using AI tooling compared to traditional ways of programming."" Ramaswami adds: ""I find the market for talent to be the best we've seen in several years."" Mr Chandrasekar says the industry had always had an ""apprenticeship"" type model, with a pipeline of young people coming in and working with senior developers. And, he suggests, executives and companies that had invested heavily in AI tech are under pressure to show some return on that investment. Even if that was by simply cutting back on hiring. Stack Overflow's research also found that while 64% of developers perceived AI as a threat to their jobs, this was four percentage points down on the previous year. ""They've now seen some of the limitations, where you need humans in the loop,"" Mr Chandrasekar notes. Previous tech disruptions had sparked fears that both senior or junior jobs would disappear, says Mr Chandrasekar. But invariably they result in more jobs as people uncover new problems and challenges. ""There's going to be an insatiable appetite for technologists and developers to go and build those things to help solve those problems."" But that spike in demand might not come in time for some of today's graduates. Mr Hart has  secured a role as a security engineer at UK-based cybersecurity firm Threatspike, which he gained through a very human centred job process. Meanwhile, Colin has turned his back on tech altogether and is considering a career in the police.

8da9624fb8dc,How to destroy harmful 'forever chemicals',,"How to destroy harmful 'forever chemicals' Zoe Corbyn Technology Reporter, San Francisco 374Water 374Water can purge PFAS from water and sludge ""There's a lot of destruction that needs to be done,"" sums up Parker Bovée of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm. He is referring to PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances), also known as ""forever chemicals"". These man-made chemicals can be found in items such as waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks and food packaging. They are used for their grease and water repellence, but do not degrade quickly and have been linked to health issues such as higher risks of certain cancers and reproductive problems. The extraordinarily strong carbon-fluorine bonds they contain gives them the ability to persist for decades or even centuries in nature. PFAS can be detected and removed from water and soil and then concentrated into smaller volumes of high strength waste. But what to do with that waste? Currently, concentrated PFAS waste is either put in long-term storage which is expensive, or incinerated (often incompletely, leading to toxic emissions), or sent to landfills for hazardous waste. But now clean-tech companies are bringing techniques to market that can destroy them. These are being tested in small-scale pilot projects with potential customers including some industrial manufacturers, municipal wastewater treatment plants and even the US military. There's a ""large and growing"" market opportunity for PFAS destruction companies notes Mr Bovée. While it is mostly currently centred in the US, others are dipping their toes, he says. In the UK, funding for water companies to look into PFAS destruction has been provided by water regulator Ofwat, with Severn Trent Water leading a project to examine the potential technologies and suppliers. One factor driving the market forward in the US is legal risk. Thousands of lawsuits claiming PFAS-related contamination and harm have been filed with some large chemical manufacturers, notably 3M, having already paid out billions in class-action settlements. Regulation is also beginning to tighten worldwide. Legal limits for two PFAS in drinking water are now scheduled to take effect in the US in 2031. PFAS remains a bipartisan issue, says Mr Bovée, and many expect that future US regulation will expand beyond drinking water to cover industrial discharge and other sources. The EU also has legal limits for PFAS in drinking water, which member states must begin enforcing from next year. Axine Water Technologies Axine's system is already in use at an auto parts company There are a variety of technologies for destroying PFAS – each with their own advantages and limitations. According to Mr Bovée, one technology that is almost commercially ready is electrochemical oxidation (EO) technology. Electrodes are placed in water contaminated by PFAS and a current is passed through, resulting in the chemicals' breakdown. While energy intensive, it doesn't require high temperature or pressure, and is easy to operate and integrate into existing treatment systems for concentrating PFAS, says Mark Ralph, CEO of Canadian-based start-up Axine Water Technologies. Last year, following a successful pilot project, it sold its first commercial-scale unit to a Michigan-based producer of automotive components. It is now up and running and the customer is planning to purchase additional systems for other sites. 374Water A waste water facility in Orlando is testing 374Water's treatment system Another technology not far behind is Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). It relies on heating and pressurising water to such a high degree that it enters a new state of matter: a so-called supercritical state. When the PFAS waste stream is introduced, it breaks the carbon-fluorine bonds. One advantage is that it can process both solid and liquid PFAS waste, says Chris Gannon, CEO of North Carolina-based 374Water. He says his technology can even destroy PFAS in plastics if they are ground up. It can be expensive to buy and maintain – the process is so intense it requires a complex reactor and regular cleaning. But it can be more cost effective if the PFAS is first concentrated before it enters the process. Currently the City of Orlando in Florida is testing 374Water's technology at its largest wastewater treatment plant. The City is trying to get ahead of the curve, explains Alan Oyler, its special projects manager for public works. Levels of PFAS in sewage sludge aren't currently regulated, but he expects them to be in the future. So far, Mr Oyler is pleased with the destruction capability he has seen, but is also waiting to see how reliable the system is. The scale of 374Water's current technology is small: it can handle just a fraction of the tonnes of wet sludge the facility produces daily. But the company is in the process of scaling up, and Mr Oyler imagines in a few years it will be able to handle all the facility's material ""ready for when the regulations require"". Other technologies on their way to being commercially ready include hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT), which uses high temperature, high pressure, and an alkaline chemical to destroy PFAS; and plasma-based technology, which involves making an ionized gas (called a plasma) to attack and degrade the PFAS molecules. Aquagga Aquagga destroyed PFAS in a fire-fighting foam mixture Yet there is one potential issue with the technologies now coming through, says Jay Meegoda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology: nasty PFAS degradation byproducts. For example, in the case of EO, highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride vapor. Each needs a ""complete study"" accounting for all their inputs and outputs, he says. The companies have claimed they either don't produce PFAS degradation products or deal with them adequately. One important partner for many of the PFAS destruction companies in testing their technologies in the real world has been the US Department of Defence (DOD). PFAS contamination at US military sites is a big, below-the-radar problem. It stems particularly from the use of older formulations of firefighting foam, used for example during training exercises or emergencies, but other routes too such as the cleaning of military equipment. More than 700 sites are known or suspected to be contaminated, posing a threat to surrounding communities. A judge recently cleared the way for PFAS contamination and harm lawsuits against the military to proceed. Clean up efforts are where the destruction companies could come in, and projects have been undertaken or are under way at various sites to assess the performance and cost effectiveness of many of their solutions. One start-up, Aquagga, which specialises in HALT technology, recently completed a demonstration project for the DOD which involved destroying a firefighting foam mixture amongst other concentrated PFAS-containing liquids. Immense volumes of the foam are currently stockpiled in all sorts of places, not just at military sites. Like others, Aquagga sees a big opportunity over the next few years for both destroying the foam and remediating the environmental damage associated with its use. And outside the military, there's a tantalizing new PFAS waste stream on the horizon. The US is actively expanding domestic computer chip manufacturing – a process that uses PFAS in massive amounts. ""We can destroy that,"" says Mr Gannon, of 374Water.

2ddf47594d31,Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV?,,"Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV? Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter XYZ Films Swedish movie Watch the Skies was dubbed into English using AI Finding international films that might appeal to the US market is an important part of the work of XYZ Films. Maxime Cottray is the chief operating officer at the Los Angeles-based independent studio. He says the US market has always been tough for foreign language films. ""It's been limited to coastal New York viewers through art house films,"" he says. It's partly a language problem. ""America is not a culture which has grown up with subtitles or dubbing like Europe has,"" he points out. But that language hurdle might be easier to clear with a new AI-driven dubbing system. The audio and video of a recent film, Watch the Skies, a Swedish sci-fi film, was fed into a digital tool called DeepEditor. It manipulates the video to make it look like actors are genuinely speaking the language the film is made into. ""The first time I saw the results of the tech two years ago I thought it was good, but having seen the latest cut, it's amazing. I'm convinced that if the average person if saw it, they wouldn't notice it - they'd assume they were speaking whatever language that is,"" says Mr Cottray. The English version of Watch The Skies was released in 110 AMC Theatres across the US in May. ""To contextualise this result, if the film were not dubbed into English, the film would never have made it into US cinemas in the first place,"" says Mr Cottray. ""US audiences were able to see a Swedish independent film that otherwise only a very niche audience would have otherwise seen."" He says that AMC plans to run more releases like this. Flawless DeepEditor can translate a performance into a different language DeepEditor was developed by Flawless, which is headquartered in Soho, London. Writer and director Scott Mann founded the company in 2020, having worked on films including Heist, The Tournament and Final Score. He felt that traditional dubbing techniques for the international versions of his films didn't quite match the emotional impact of the originals. ""When I worked on Heist in 2014, with a brilliant cast including Robert De Niro, and then I saw that movie translated to a different language, that's when I first realised that no wonder the movies and TV don't travel well, because the old world of dubbing really kind of changes everything about the film,"" says Mr Mann, now based in Los Angeles. ""It's all out of sync, and it's performed differently. And from a purist filmmaking perspective, a very much lower grade product is being seen by the rest of the world."" Flawless Scott Mann founded Flawless in 2020 Flawless developed its own technology for identifying and modifying faces, based on a method first presented in a research paper in 2018. ""DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection [such as facial features] and 3D face tracking to understand the actor's appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot,"" says Mr Mann. The tech can preserve actors' original performances across languages, without reshoots or re-recordings, reducing costs and time, he says. According to him, Watch the Skies was the world's first fully visually-dubbed feature film. As well as giving an actor the appearance of speaking another language, DeepEditor can also transfer a better performance from one take into another, or swap a new line of dialogue, while keeping the original performance with its emotional content intact. Thanks to the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple, the global film dubbing market is set to increase from US$4bn (£3bn) in 2024 to $7.6bn by 2033, according to a report by Business Research Insights. Mr Mann won't say how much the tech costs but says it varies per project. ""I'd say it works out at about a tenth of the cost of shooting it or changing it any other way."" His customers include ""pretty much all the really big streamers"". Mr Mann believes the technology will enable films to be seen by a wider audience. ""There is an enormous amount of incredible kind of cinema and TV out there that is just never seen by English speaking folks, because many don't want to watch it with dubbing and subtitles,"" says Mr Mann. The tech isn't here to replace actors, says Mann, who says voice actors are used rather than being replaced with synthetic voices. ""What we found is that if you make the tools for the actual creatives and the artists themselves, that's the right way of doing it… they get kind of the power tools to do their art and that can feed into the finished product. That's the opposite of a lot of approaches that other tech companies have taken."" Natan Dvir Neta Alexander is concerned about a ""monolingual"" film culture However, Neta Alexander, assistant professor of film and media at Yale University, says that while the promise of wider distribution is tempting, using AI to reconfigure performances for non-native markets risks eroding the specificity and texture of language, culture, and gesture. ""If all foreign films are adapted to look and sound English, the audience's relationship with the foreign becomes increasingly mediated, synthetic, and sanitised,"" she says. ""This could discourage cross-cultural literacy and disincentivise support for subtitled or original-language screenings."" Meanwhile, she says, the displacement of subtitles, a key tool for language learners, immigrants, deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers and many others, raises concerns about accessibility. ""Closed captioning is not just a workaround; it's a method of preserving the integrity of both visual and auditory storytelling for diverse audiences,"" says Prof Alexander. Replacing this with automated mimicry suggests a disturbing turn toward commodified and monolingual film culture, she says. ""Rather than ask how to make foreign films easier for English-speaking audiences, we might better ask how to build audiences that are willing to meet diverse cinema on its own terms.""

fc9e35f6ba19,Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls,,"Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls Jane Chambers Business reporter, El Alto, Bolivia Getty Images Higher food and fuel prices have led to street protests across Bolivia this year As Bolivians prepare to vote in a general election, the country's deep economic woes are the central issue. Whoever becomes the nation's next president faces a very difficult job to try to sort out the mess. El Alto is Bolivia's second-largest city, home to 1.2 million people. And, at an elevation of 4,150m (13,615ft), it is the world's highest city with a population of more than 100,000. It's full of narrow streets with vendors trying to sell you everything from oranges to knock-off designer trainers. Standing on a pavement, car mechanic Josue Macias is enjoying an ice cream with his young son. He describes how Bolivia's sky-high inflation is affecting him and his family. The annual rate soared to 24% in June. ""Prices for everything are going up, but we are still earning the same,"" he says. ""We are just about getting by, but it's hard because food prices are rising all the time, things like meat, oil and eggs. They are double or triple what they used to be. ""We've had to tighten our belts. We don't go out to eat in restaurants anymore. Instead, I'm here on the street having an ice-cream with my son!"" Bolivia's inflation spike has been caused by a combination of factors. Falling natural gas production and therefore exports of this key foreign earner has led to a decline in overseas revenues. In turn, this has meant a shortage of US dollars, making it harder and more costly for the country to import petrol, diesel and food stuffs, leading to shortages and price hikes. It has led to street protests across the country. At some petrol stations across the country, lorry drivers often have to wait more than 24 hours to fill up. Taxi driver Gonzalo Rios is frustrated. As we drive along the pot-holed streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, he tells me about his struggles. ""Before it was easy to fill up with petrol. Now I must wait for around four to six hours at the gas pump to get some, and that's too much. It's such a waste of time. ""And the prices are so expensive,"" he adds. ""Now the money we earn doesn't cover our costs. But we can't put our fares up because if we do, we won't have any customers. It would be too expensive for them."" Car mechanic Josue Macias says he can afford to buy an ice cream but not go out for a proper meal For almost 20 years the Bolivian government kept fuel prices artificially low through subsidies. This started when the government of then President Evo Morales nationalised the country's hydrocarbon sector in 2006. But in 2023, state energy company YPFB said Bolivia was running out of domestically-produced natural gas, due to a lack of investment in new exploration. Without this gas to export, the Bolivian government is struggling to continue to find the funds to subsidise petrol and diesel. Last year it spent $2bn (£1.5bn) on such subsidies, according to a recent statement by a former minister of hydrocarbons and energy. Outgoing left-wing President Luis Arce, who is not seeking re-election on 17 August, blamed the Bolivian parliament for the fall in natural gas production, accusing MPs of blocking vital oversea loans. His opponents in turn blame him for the economic turmoil. The official exchange rate of Bolivia's currency, the bolivianos, is certainly not helping matters. Since 2011 the government has fixed the exchange rate at 6.96 bolivianos to one US dollar. But unofficially you can get 14 to 15 bolivianos per dollar. This has led to a thriving black market, especially of exports, from which the government misses out on tax revenue. Economist Gary Rodriguez, the general manager for the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade, explains: ""A product that costs seven bolivianos here in Bolivia can be sold for 15 bolivianos abroad,"" he says. ""The problem is that businesses would prefer to sell items on the [overseas] black market rather than here in Bolivia which leads to food and fuel shortages."" Getty Images Fuel shortages have caused queues at petrol stations across Bolivia Restrictions on the use of credit cards is another headache for Bolivia's business community. ""The problem with the credit cards is that all the banks have limits that are ridiculous,"" says Alessandra Guglielmi, who owns a food business called The Clean Spot. ""You can [only] spend around $35 a month over the internet with online purchases. $35 is nothing for a business."" She is concerned about her business going under. ""I am worried with food prices going up I can't afford to pay my staff a decent salary,"" says Ms Guglielmi. ""I am worried about the people not being able to afford to buy my products because I must put the prices up. ""And I am worried because my margins have gone down so it's very hard right now for me to keep a business."" Many people in Bolivia are hoping that a new government will be able to turn the country's fortunes around. Two right-wing candidates are currently ahead in the polls for the presidential race. Leading is Samuel Doria Medina of National Unity Front. He was previously the main shareholder of Bolivia's largest cement manufacturer. In second place is Jorge Quiroga of Freedom and Democracy. He has been president of Bolivia before, from 2001 to 2002. If no candidate gets more than half the votes on 17 August – which no-one is expected to achieve - then there will be a second round of voting on 19 October. Bolivian political scientist and analyst Franklin Pareja is sceptical that the next administration will be able to improve most people's lives. Franklin Pareja says it will be difficult for the new government to improve matters ""The population is assigning a change in government almost magical qualities, because they think that with a change of government we'll return to stability and prosperity,"" he says. ""And that's not going to happen. ""Bolivia will only feel the hard impact of the economic crisis with a new government, because it will make structural economic changes, which will be unpopular."" Mr Rodríguez is adamant that the Bolivian economy needs to be significantly altered. ""We need to change the model, because the current model, has too much emphasis on the state,"" he says. ""There are two actors, one the state sector and the other the private sector. The driver of development must be the citizen, the entrepreneur, and for that, the state must do what it's meant to do. In other words, good laws, good regulations, good institutions."" While polls suggest Bolivia's next administration is likely to be right-wing, such radical governmental and economic change, to significantly reduce the state's role, is not expected.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nn665g32o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a5e6/live/d4580680-76a7-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg,2025-08-13T23:29:33.362000+00:00,722dc32286ccf2e8c391ada62ebbf5bc9be90897
8e83e83a125d,How the US got left behind in the global electric car race,,"How the US got left behind in the global electric car race Getty Images You could be forgiven for thinking that electric cars might finally be gaining momentum in the US. After all, sales of battery cars topped 1.2 million last year, more than five times the number just four years earlier. Hybrid sales have jumped by a factor of three. Battery-powered cars accounted for 10% of overall sales in August - a new high, according to S&P Global Mobility. And in updates to investors this week, General Motors, Ford, Tesla and other companies all reported record electric sales over the past three months. This marked a bright spot in an industry wrestling with the fallout from still high interest rates and buyers on edge over inflation, tariffs and the wider economy. But analysts say the boom was caused by a dash to buy before the end of a government subsidy that helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,588) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. With that tax credit gone as of the end of September, carmakers are expecting momentum to shift into reverse. ""It's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,"" Ford chief executive Jim Farley said at an event on Tuesday. ""I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously,"" the chief financial officer of General Motors, Paul Jacobson, said at a conference last month, adding it would take time to see how quickly buyers would come back. Even with the recent gains, the US, the world's second biggest car market, stood out as a laggard in electric car sales compared to much of the rest of the world. In the UK, for example, sales of battery electric and hybrid cars made up nearly 30% of new sales last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Latest industry figures suggest that number is even higher. In Europe, they accounted for roughly one in five sales, while in China, the world's biggest car market, sales of such cars accounted for almost half of overall sales last year, according to the IEA, and they are expected to become the majority this year. Take-up in some other countries, like Norway and Nepal, is even greater. Electric vehicles (EVs) tend to account for a smaller share of sales in Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia - but growth there has been surging. Policy differences Analysts say adoption in the US has been slowed by comparatively weak government support for the sector, which has limited the kinds of subsidies, trade-in programmes and rules that have helped the industry in places such as China, the UK and Europe. Former President Joe Biden pushed hard to increase take-up, aiming for electric cars to account for half of all sales in the US by 2030. His administration tightened rules on emissions, boosted demand through purchases for government fleets, nudged carmakers to invest with loans and grants for EV investments, spent billions building charging stations and expanded the $7,500 tax credit as a sweetener for buyers. Supporters cast those efforts in part as a competitive imperative, warning that without these US carmakers would risk losing out to competitors from China and other countries. But President Donald Trump, who recently called climate change a ""con job"", has pushed to scrap many of those measures, including the $7,500 credit, arguing that they were pushing people to buy cars they would not otherwise want. ""We're saying ... you're not going to be forced to make all of those cars,"" he said this summer, while signing a bill aimed at striking down rules from California, which would have phased out sales of petrol-only cars in the state by 2035. ""You can make them, but it'll be by the market, judged by the market."" Bloomberg via Getty Images Electric cars have become more affordable in the US in recent years - but they still cost more than comparable petrol-powered vehicles. And Chinese carmakers like BYD, which have made rapid inroads in other markets thanks to low prices, have been effectively shut out of the US, due to high tariffs targeting cars made in China, backed by both Biden and Trump. As of August, the average transaction price of an electric car in the US was more than $57,000, according to auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, about 16% higher than the average for all cars. The least expensive battery car on offer, a Nissan Leaf, costs about $30,000 (£22,000). By comparison, several models can be found for under £20,000 in the UK. Analysts say what buyers do next hinges on how carmakers set prices in the months ahead, as they contend not only with the end of the tax credit but also tariffs on foreign cars and certain car parts that Trump introduced this spring. Hyundai said this week it would offset the loss of the tax credit by lowering the price for its range of Ioniq EVs. But Tesla said the cost for monthly lease payments of some of its cars would rise. Stephanie Brinley, associate director of S&P Global Mobility, said she did not expect to see many firms follow Hyundai's example, given the pressures from tariffs. While some buyers may opt for EVs anyway, ""next year is going to be hard,"" she warned, noting that her firm is calling for overall car sales to fall by roughly 2% in 2026. ""It would have been difficult enough if all you had to deal with is new tariffs, but with new tariffs and the incentive going away, there's two impacts."" Carmakers had already been scaling back their investments in electric cars. Researchers say Trump's policy changes could reduce those investments even more. ""It's a big hit to the EV industry - there's no tiptoeing around it,"" said Katherine Yusko, research analyst at the American Security Project ""The subsidies were initially a way to level the playing field and now that they're gone the US has a lot of ground to make up."" However Ms Brinley said she was hesitant to declare the US behind in an industry still testing out technology alternatives. ""Is [electric] really the right thing?"" she said. ""Saying that we're behind assumes that this is the only and best solution and I think it's a little early to say that.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ex2l58en4o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1211/live/e939d750-9fbe-11f0-b73e-e715acbd6a10.jpg,2025-10-05T07:45:21.055000+00:00,fbdb13b747bbad04afb1a8e85aabe3a30e2a5b34
94d7c33551e6,Harrods sets aside more than £60m for abuse compensation,,"Harrods sets aside more than £60m for abuse compensation Marc Ashdown Business correspondent and Imogen James Getty Images Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of historical abuse. More than 100 employees of the luxury department store are expected to claim up to £385,000 each via the redress scheme which is open until March 2026. The scheme, launched in March, provides to victims who claim they have suffered abuse by former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who died in 2023. Multiple women have accused Fayed, who owned the luxury store between 1985 to 2010, of rape and sexual assault. The Met Police said that 146 people have come forward to report a crime in their investigation into Fayed. Harrods have set aside £57 million to be used to compensate alleged victims, with an extra £5.3m reserved to cover legal and administrative costs, bringing the total amount allocated to £62.3 million. Harrods Managing director Michael Ward said that ""more than 100 survivors"" have joined the process of the scheme since it was opened. He added: ""Compensation awards and interim payments began being issued to eligible survivors at the end of April 2025 and the scheme will remain open until 31 March 2026."" The compensation scheme will award each eligible claimant general damages of £200,000. They could receive up to £385,000 in compensation, plus treatment costs, if they agree to be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist, or up to £150,000 without a medical assessment, Harrods said in March . Partially due to the scheme, Harrods recorded a £34.3 million loss in its latest full year accounts, compared with a profit of £111 million the previous year. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: ""While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future."" To be eligible for the scheme, claimants must prove that they were subject to sexual assault and/or wrongful testing, and prove that Harrods is liable. Many of those who say Fayed abused them underwent intrusive medical examinations when they were hired. In accepting a compensation offer, victims will waive their right to pursue further action for damages. The Harrods Group also operates smaller stores at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as a small chain of beauty stores. Revenues for the financial year 2024 were broadly flat at just over £1bn. It blamed the drop in profits on weaker beauty trading and modernising some of its systems. Mr Ward added: ""The current domestic and global economic environment means that current trading conditions in the luxury sector remain challenging. ""However, we remain confident in the strength of the business, and the resilience of the luxury sector, and that we will continue to drive progress towards longer-term growth and performance objectives."" Fayed was not charged before his death two years ago.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20ky6n79eo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cff8/live/be03c110-a12e-11f0-a9f1-8d9167fcc08f.jpg,2025-10-04T14:31:40.096000+00:00,17ef6fd69be9106f799ee1f1fe8fdd9875a65ac6
03517695c60b,Barrowman says chase our partners for the money,,"A company linked to Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman passed most of the money it received from the government for personal protective equipment (PPE) to other firms, according to a spokesperson for Mr Barrowman. On Wednesday a judge ordered PPE Medpro to repay £122m as the gowns it supplied did not meet sterility certification standards. However, £83m of that was paid to other companies and there was a ""very strong case"" for the administrator to chase them for the money, the spokesperson said. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said his department would seek to ""recover everything we can"". When Mr Barrowman spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in 2023 , he said PPE Medpro was set up as a consortium with companies called Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates. In that interview, Mr Barrowman said: ""The British government would have preferred to always trade with a UK company, so we created PPE Medpro as a UK business, so that the three partners could provide PPE to the British government."" Baroness Mone, a Conservative peer at the time, used her contacts to enter the company into the ""VIP lane"" to get preferential access to government contracts. Mr Barrowman's spokesperson claimed that the company itself did not undertake the technical work of liaising with manufacturers in China, including quality control and sterility assurance levels. The other parties distanced themselves from PPE Medpro once the government began legal action, and only communicated through lawyers, the spokesperson said. A High Court judgement on Wednesday ordered PPE Medpro to repay £122m to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), having ruled that the gowns the company supplied did not meet sterility certification standards. The day before, the directors of PPE Medpro started the process of putting the company into administration. Administrators will seek to wind the company up and try to recover as much money as possible for creditors. However, the company only has £666,000 of assets, so it is unlikely to be able to repay the DHSC in full. The government has said it will work closely with the administrators. Despite Baroness Mone not being a shareholder or director of the company, some politicians have called on her to repay the money personally. The spokesperson for Mr Barrowman said: ""It seems incredibly unfair that all the attention has focused on Doug Barrowman when there was a consortium. ""There is a very strong case for the administrator [of PPE Medpro] to chase the other consortium members whose companies received huge funds."" However, Mr Barrowman has admitted receiving a large share of the proceeds himself. In his 2023 interview, he told the BBC he had received around £60m from PPE Medpro. Baroness Mone said that a share of that sum was paid into a trust in the Isle of Man, of which she and her children are beneficiaries, and so potentially stand to receive the money. Loudwater's parent company, Loudwater Holdings Ltd, is based in North London. It had net assets of more than £55m, according to its latest accounts, and a turnover of £95m. The National Crime Agency is investigating the PPE Medpro case. It declined to comment on whether it was also looking into the other members of the consortium. Loudwater declined to comment. Eric Beare Associates did not respond to requests for comment. The DHSC did not say whether it would pursue other members of the consortium.

Now they can't get their money back Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent BBC ""Throw your current lifestyle overboard!"" boasts the advert for Victoria Cruises Line (VCL), which bills itself as the world's first affordable residential cruise. Cabins typically go for US$3,840 (£2,858) a month for a three-year voyage to 115 countries, and travellers from all over the world have the option of doing the route for as long as they like. For Australians Dennis and Taryna Wawn from Perth, excited by the prospect of a home at sea, the advert on Facebook couldn't have come at a better time as they planned their retirement. Three years later, the ship has yet to sail. In fact, they and other would-be cruise residents have found that VCL does not even own or have a lease on the ship that is being advertised. The Wawns are just two of dozens of people who have been waiting for VCL to refund their deposits, the BBC has learned. Other would-be residents told the BBC they sold their homes, rehomed cats and put their belongings into storage. One woman said she had put down her sick dog, believing she would be gone for years. Another couple have now had to move into a retirement community because of their advanced ages and failing health. They could no longer commit to a residential cruise that might or might not ever sail. ""The people that put down a deposit for this cruise were sold a dream... and it has turned into nothing short of a nightmare,"" said Adam Glezer, who runs a consumer advocacy company. ""What VCL has done is disgusting."" Those affected have contacted the company, some have launched legal cases and others have filed consumer complaints to government agencies. One even wrote to the FBI. VCL told the BBC that it still needs more customers before a vessel can be chartered and so is continuing to advertise the cruise. The company said customers knew about the occupancy condition when booking, and the company denies targeting or harming anyone, adding that it advised some clients not to sell homes to pay deposits. Many of those who signed up have given up hope of the ship ever sailing, or of getting their money back. 'All above board' Dennis and Taryna Wawn from Perth, Australia said the retirement cruise seemed like a dream Taryna, 64, said that in May 2022, she and Dennis were starting to think about their future and what it could look like when they came across the residential cruise. The couple feel they did their due diligence. Taryna said the company had a well-built and detailed website, they also spoke to a man from the company ""who answered all the questions"", and they joined a Facebook group made up of other cruise ""residents"". ""We did some checking, thought it was all above board,"" she said. Within a month, they took the step of paying a deposit of US$10,000 (£7,450). Their bank transfer has been viewed by the BBC. But weeks before they were due to set sail in May 2023, VCL postponed the scheduled departure date. In an email viewed by the BBC, VCL said the cruise hadn't reached a roughly 80% occupancy - something the company said it needed in order to charter a vessel. When VCL postponed twice more, the couple started to think something was up. Then a fellow would-be resident got in touch, saying: ""I've dug a little bit further. Get out."" 'Our shared dream is very much alive' The website of Victoria Cruises Line is still advertising the cruise even though the ship has not yet sailed VCL's marketing promised a fully-fledged cruise liner that could house 1,350 guests, with pools, tennis courts and an Italian restaurant. ""We do have a beautiful, seaworthy ship, the former Holland American Veendam, now the Majestic,"" VCL's US representative wrote on the company's Facebook page. But the BBC has learned that on being contacted by some would-be residents, the firm that owns the ship denied any association with VCL. Although it has not yet leased a ship, the company said it has continued to advertise the cruise and collect deposits in order to reach the necessary occupancy rate. ""If we had signed the lease agreement at the beginning of 2024, we would have had to pay approximately USD 18 million for nothing,"" VCL said in an email to the BBC. It also acknowledged that there had been 132 cancellations, and said it investigated 38 complaints, but found none justified a refund. VCL also denied there were any ""victims"", and said that 38 customers who asked for refunds cannot accept they were not entitled to one. The company added that the refunds were withheld for administrative reasons, missing or incorrect bank details, failure to return termination administration agreements within deadlines, and anti-money laundering checks. VCL's cruise was last scheduled to depart on 26 July 2025, according to its website. But once again it failed to set sail. ""Despite the delay, we've been encouraged by a surprising influx of new interest in recent weeks - a strong signal that our shared dream is very much alive,"" VCL's website reads. 'It got dirty' Graham Whittaker, a former journalist based in Australia, estimates that VCL has taken money that goes into the millions. ""It got dirty because we started to find scores and scores more people who had never been refunded, who had asked for their money back, who had been lied to,"" Whittaker said. When passengers pushed harder - asking about refunds, and talking to the media about the case - they were threatened with legal action. The BBC has seen dozens of such emails. ""The threats and the harassments are getting serious for some,"" Whittaker said. VCL justified the threat of legal action in its email to the BBC. ""Yes, we will take legal action against anyone who tries to settle their complaint on social media,"" it said. The paper trail Company records reviewed by the BBC show a web of shell businesses registered to the same address in Budapest, some now no longer trading. The company is also registered in Florence, Italy, but as a specialised wholesaler of food, beverages and tobacco. In Hungary, Viktória Takács-Ollram is listed as the founder, while her 79-year-old mother is registered as the chief executive. Another company is registered under the same address to Viktória's son, Marcell Herold, who is named as the vice president of VCL on its website. In Hungary, VCL was registered in 2017 under a different name as an accounting and tax advising firm. That changed to VCL in 2022, with ""services auxiliary to waterborne transport"" and ""rental of water transport equipment"" added. In 2023 new activities were added: ""car rental"", ""lending of other machinery and equipment"". As of 1 January 2025, its main activity is listed as ""passenger transport by sea"". Tax filings indicate more than $253,000 in unpaid taxes. Taking matters into their own hands A couple won a case in Hungary, overturning VCL's contract changes, but enforcement stalled when VCL shifted its base to Italy. VCL admitted to the BBC that it changed contracts after customers signed, and that new terms would apply retroactively. ""When drafting a contract, lawyers try to include everything. But sometimes life happens and the contract needs to be amended. That is what happened in this case,"" VCL said. ""These contracts work this way for all shipping companies."" The Utah investigation found that VCL had not booked a departure port as advertised on its website Another couple filed a complaint in the US state of Utah, with the investigation finding that a berth was not booked on a stated departure date. It also found that people purporting to be hired staff on the website did not plan to be on the cruise, nor had they received offers of employment. The investigation ruling said that VCL's US representative encouraged people to sign up for the cruise. The investigation found that she truthfully believed the residential cruise was going to sail, but she agreed to sign a compliance order barring her from promoting such travel services in the future. 'Not a phantom company' Despite all of this, VCL continues to advertise its cruise on Facebook and Instagram. Accounts on the platforms show glossy brochures of the ship's decks, menus and cabins. Investigators contacted some of the people purported to be crew, who said they had not received employment offers New ""residents"" are shown posing on board - many of them are actually stock images widely available on the internet. To encourage lengthy stays, the cruise company has been offering hefty discounts, flash sales and cashback schemes. Alleged victims say they have reported the ads repeatedly, but Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram - has declined to take them down. ""It is reprehensible that these platforms are allowing advertising for VCL despite the significant amount of evidence. They should be held accountable for this,"" said consumer champion Adam Glezer. In a statement, Meta told the BBC that its advertising standards strictly prohibit deceptive or misleading ads, including scams, but it found no evidence that the page violates its policies. VCL denied that it was running a scam, saying those affected were unable to accept that they were not entitled to a refund. ""Our company has never disappeared, we have responded to every email, so we are not a phantom company."" Taryna said the idea of the cruise isn't too good to be true - some people who signed up for the VCL cruise were currently travelling the world with other cruise liners. However, for her and Dennis, going on another such cruise is no longer something they can afford. ""It was a dream for us and we were really focusing on it as a lovely adventure. It's been traumatising.""

525d4cc472f7,Sales of electric cars hit record high in September,,"Sales of electric cars hit record high in September Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK hit a record high last month, according to the latest industry figures. Sales of pure battery electric vehicles (BEV) grew by almost a third to 72,779 in September, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT), while sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster. It means sales of fully electric or hybrid vehicles made up more than half of all new car registrations in the UK last month. The SMMT said sales were driven by carmakers offering discounts, a larger choice of models, and the introduction of the government's grant scheme. While registrations of BEVs rose last month, the overwhelming majority - 71.4% - were bought by businesses or to be used in fleets. However, the number of private buyers of fully electric cars has risen in the past year, and the SMMT said zero-emission vehicles now accounted for more than one in five (22.1%) new cars registered so far in 2025. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said electrified vehicles were ""powering market growth after a sluggish summer"". Industry investment in electric vehicles was ""paying off"", he said, despite consumer demand ""trailing ambition"". Mr Hawes added the government's electric car grant scheme, in which eligible vehicles get a discount of up to £3,750 as part of efforts to encourage drivers to move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, would help ""break down one of the barriers"" holding back people making the switch. Overall, the number of new vehicle registrations -  312,887 - marked the best performing September since 2020, which despite the Covid lockdown restrictions, remains the best so far this decade, according to the SMMT. The strong month comes as the UK car industry navigates the economic impact of US tariffs and Jaguar Land Rover's shutdown of production due to a major cyber-attack . The Kia Sportage, Ford Puma and Nissan Qashqai were the best-selling cars in September, but two Chinese models including the Jaecoo 7 and BYD Seal U were in the top 10. The government said more than 20,000 people had benefited from EV grants to date, which apply to models from several well-known brands such as Ford, Toyota, Vauxhall and Citroen. Under the scheme, the discount applies to new eligible car models costing up to £37,000, with the most environmentally friendly ones seeing the biggest reductions. Some 36 models have been cleared for discounts of at least £1,500. Ian Plummer, Autotrader's chief commercial officer, said the grant scheme had given a ""real lift to the market"". ""Since July, enquiries for new electric vehicles on Autotrader are up by almost 50%. For models eligible for the grant, interest has more than doubled.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd094168go,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e058/live/ac7c44b0-a06d-11f0-8687-4726d7177866.jpg,2025-10-04T00:41:12.022000+00:00,c2cee89e2b64b3f9778f038b685524a65a696171
151360c42ea1,Rail firm fined £1m over train passenger's death,,"Rail firm fined £1m over train passenger's death Tess de la Mare West of England PA Media Bethan Roper was returning home from a Christmas shopping trip when she died on the train on 1 December 2018 A major rail operator has been fined £1m for breaching health and safety law when a young woman suffered a fatal injury after placing her head outside a droplight window. Bethan Roper, 28, was killed on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train near Twerton in Bath on 1 December 2018 when her head struck a tree branch. Regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR on the grounds it was aware of the issue of droplight windows, and had not yet implemented steps identified in a risk assessment undertaken two months before Ms Roper's death. GWR was fined and also ordered to pay £78,000 after pleading guilty to two counts of breaching health and safety law. Richard Hines, ORR's chief inspector of railways, said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Bethan Roper. ""Her death was a preventable tragedy that highlights the need for train operators to proactively manage risks and act swiftly when safety recommendations are made to keep their passengers safe."" GWR told BBC West: ""Bethan Roper's death was a tragic incident, and our thoughts remain with her family and friends. ""We accept the judge's decision and remain committed to continuously improving passenger and colleague safety across our network. ""In sentencing, the judge recognised our strong safety record both before and after this incident, and the safety of our passengers and colleagues remains our highest priority."" Ms Roper, from Penarth in Wales, worked for the Welsh Refugee Council, was a Unite union convener and also chaired the Cardiff West branch of Socialist Party Wales. She had been returning home from a Christmas shopping trip in Bath and was intoxicated when she boarded the train, an inquest held in 2021 heard. PA/Cardiff School of Journalism Bethan Roper worked for the Wales Refugee Council Investigators told the inquest that a yellow warning label above the window bearing the words ""Caution do not lean out of window when train is moving"" was an insufficient deterrent. Ms Roper's death echoed a similar incident in 2016 in which a passenger died near Balham, south London, resulting in the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) issuing safety recommendations in May 2017. GWR did not produce a written risk assessment until September 2017, but that assessment found droplight windows to be one of the most significant passenger safety risks. The ORR found the assessment to be insufficient and wrote to GWR about its concerns. However the assessment was not revised, and the actions GWR had set out to reduce the risk were not implemented before the fatal accident of 2018, the ORR said. Since Ms Roper's death, measures have been introduced across the rail industry to prevent passengers leaning out of droplight windows. Trains with such windows have since been withdrawn from service or fitted with engineering controls to prevent windows being opened while trains are moving. The ORR said it welcomed actions taken by GWR and the wider industry to reduce risk.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20ej7rkj3ko,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7f2a/live/7f80e460-a104-11f0-ac34-1b87a37e0e9a.jpg,2025-10-04T15:17:17.671000+00:00,fc6d7f2d229e4786529318ee88beb6eae68f77e4
db76d8aa3239,Renault customers told to be vigilant after data hack,,"Renault UK has confirmed that some of its customers' data has been stolen in a cyber-attack that targeted a third-party data processing provider. No customer financial data, such as passwords or bank account details, had been obtained, Renault said, but other personal data had been accessed and the carmaker warned customers to be vigilant. The French-owned carmaker would not specify how many people could be affected ""for ongoing security reasons"" but said it did not anticipate any wider implications for the company, as none of Renault's own systems had been hacked. It comes after rival Jaguar Land Rover and brewing giant Asahi have had production stopped by cyber-attacks on their systems. Renault UK said affected people would be notified and that victims of the hack may include a wider pool of people who had entered competitions or shared data with the car company, without purchasing a vehicle. The carmaker said the data that had been accessed by the cyber-attack included some or all of: customer names, addresses, dates of birth, gender, phone number, vehicle identification numbers and vehicle registration details. A Renault spokesperson said: ""The third-party provider has confirmed this is an isolated incident which has been contained, and we are working with it to ensure that all appropriate actions are being taken. We have notified all relevant authorities. ""We are in the process of contacting all affected customers, advising them of the cyber-attack and reminding them to be cautious of any unsolicited requests for personal information,"" they added. Jaguar Land Rover was recently forced to stop production and take a £1.5bn loan underwritten by the government after being targeted by hackers at the end of August.

19566e62ad26,True cost of becoming a mum highlighted in new data on pay,,"True cost of becoming a mum highlighted in new data on pay Femilola Miller Femilola Miller says the motherhood penalty is ""engrained in society"" Mums in England face a ""substantial and long-lasting reduction"" in earnings after having children, according to new findings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Five years after having their first child, mums' earnings drop by an average of £1,051 a month compared with their salary one year before having a child. Mums' earnings continue to be affected after the births of second and third children. Rachel Grocott, chief executive of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, called the findings ""completely abhorrent"" and said the impact of the motherhood penalty is ""not just unfair - it's avoidable"". In the first dataset of its kind , the ONS has looked at the earnings and employment status of mums after having a first, second and third child over an eight-year period from April 2014 to December 2022. Mums earn £313 a month less on average five years after the birth of their second child, and £689 a month less five years after their third child. Each figure is compared to their salary one year before each birth. Mums suffer ""maximum losses"" in the first year after their children are born, when they are more likely to take extended parental leave than dads. When compared with a mum's earnings in the year before the birth of a child, the total loss in earnings over five years was: £65,618 for a first child £26,317 for a second child £32,456 for a third child Femilola Miller, from London, has three children aged seven, five and three. Before starting a family, she and her husband David had similar salaries, but he now earns £55,000 a year more than her. Both she and her husband took several months off work after the birth of each child, ""but every time my husband went back to work, he got a promotion"". ""Mothers are not compensated even if they return to work full time and are dedicated to their career."" She believes the motherhood penalty is ""engrained in society"" and some people enforce the stereotypes ""without even realising"", she says, remembering several comments people had made to her about whether she would return to work after having children. ""It was not even a question about what was going to happen to David's career,"" she says. ""I had a career before I had children and I want to carry on working full-time."" Femilola Miller Femilola has three children aged seven, five and three Although the gender pay gap is slowly reducing in the UK, women working full time still earn 7% less than men . Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said the motherhood penalty was ""a perfect storm of bias, outdated legislation and cultural norms"". She added ""the vast majority"" of the gender pay gap is linked to the motherhood penalty, which can be attributed to a number of factors, including: unaffordable childcare costs for some families an unbalanced parental leave system some jobs not offering flexible and part-time working hours pregnancy and maternity discrimination The government has introduced 30 hours a week of funded childcare for working parents and is undertaking a review of parental leave . New laws also came into force in England, Wales and Scotland last year which give women greater protection against redundancy while pregnant or on maternity leave. But, according to research from Pregnant then Screwed and Women in Data, up to 74,000 new or expectant mums lose their jobs each year due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination. Evie Jay Evie says mums often feel like they ""can't win"" in the juggle between work and parenthood Evie, 33, from Newcastle, says she feels as though her career is ""on hold"" until her daughter goes to school. Evie initially reduced her hours at work when three-year-old Ellie was born, but now works 35 hours a week in the NHS. She wants to retrain as a therapist, but doing so would mean she could no longer work from home, which isn't compatible with her childcare arrangements. She described becoming a mum as ""the best thing that's happened to me, but career-wise, it has been a punishment"". ""You're expected to be a parent like you don't work, but work like you haven't got kids. You can't win."" Emma Potts, manager of Market Place Cafe in Stoke-on-Trent, says it is ""a really difficult balance"" for small businesses like hers to accommodate flexible working, part-time hours or maternity cover. ""We always try to be as supportive as possible, but the reality is that in a small team, flexibility is much harder to manage."" If staff members were to reduce their hours to part-time, ""it would cause real issues"", she says. ""Ultimately, smaller businesses like ours don't have the luxury of large teams or spare capacity. ""Every shift matters, every deadline matters, and every absence makes a difference."" Katie Guild, co-founder of Nugget Savings, a business that helps new and expectant parents with financial planning, says the impact of having children can be ""shocking"" on finances, but there are a number of things parents can do. This includes checking which benefits you are entitled to and ensuring your employer still contributes to your pension based on your salary as it was before maternity leave. ""Unfortunately, a lot of what we deal with is mothers having difficult situations with their employers and not knowing whether they have a leg to stand on legally,"" she says. ""Knowing your rights is really crucial.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq4x697q5o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d165/live/0842cff0-9fc7-11f0-9657-87c2ccf2abb3.jpg,2025-10-03T13:57:45.861000+00:00,7a061578389ae677375bae4db94c9ae15d0f648a
c2f5d01e6446,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader",,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader Kate Whannel Political reporter Green Party leader of England and Wales Zack Polanski:  'We will make sure that the very wealthiest pay more tax' Newly-elected Green Party leader Zack Polanski has told his party's conference a tax on the wealthiest would end ""rip-off Britain"" and make the country ""an affordable"" place to live. Addressing members in Bournemouth, he said taxing the assets of the richest 1% would enable the government to fund universal free childcare, special needs education and rural bus routes. He also defended migrants and refugees to loud applause from the audience and accused Labour of being ""handmaidens"" of Reform UK adding: ""When Farage says jump, Labour asks 'how high'."" Polanski has described himself as an ""eco-populist"" and is seeking to shift the party to the left to take on Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party. The prime minister has sought to tighten immigration controls in recent months, in what is being seen by critics as a response to Reform leading national opinion polls. But Sir Keir launched an attack on Reform leader Nigel Farage in his Labour conference speech this week, accusing him of sowing division and not believing in Britain - something denied by Farage. Polanski described Farage as a ""Trump-loving corporate stooge"" and accused Sir Keir of jumping to his tune. Unusually for a speech by a Green Party leader, Polanski did not focus primarily on the environment. He told the conference: ""You can not be an effective environmentalist without talking about the deep inequality in our society."" Much of his speech centred on the problems posed by the cost of living, pointing to a rise in homelessness, tenants worried about their rent and families struggling to pay bills. Polanski argued that the country's problems were ""rooted in an economic model built on austerity and privatisation"" but that the Green Party would ""break the shackles of poverty and hardship that lock so many in"". ""This is a country with so much going for it, but we have been failed time and time again by a political class poisoned by extreme wealth and you can see that poison everyday."" ""A country where a tiny few have taken our power and wealth. Things must change. It's time to take it back."" He said some voters might worry that they could be hit by taxes on the wealthiest being proposed by his party. ""Hairdressers and plumbers say understandably 'I've worked hard all my life. Why are you taxing me? Why are you taxing my ambition?'"" However, Polanski said he was targeting people who ""will make more money in one night than everyone in this room could probably earn in an entire year"". In a 20 minute speech, Polanski told the conference his party's ""horizons"" would not be ""narrow"" and that he would ""not be silent"" on ""the mass slaughter in Palestine"". ""We must stop selling arms to Israel, we must stop sharing intelligence,"" he said. He also criticised what he called a ""draconian crackdown on the right to protest"". ""From terrorist proscription against protesters, to banning journalists from their conference, to diving into a rushed evidence-free plan for digital IDs that are likely to discriminate against minorities - the alarm bells of authoritarianism are now ringing."" In his defence of refugees and migrants, Polanski said it was the ""economic system"" that was a ""threat to the places we love... not people arriving small boats"". To loud cheers from party members he declared : ""We'll say it loud, we'll say it clear migrants and refugees are welcome here."" He said the Greens wanted to stop small boats crossing the Channel through ""safe and legal routes"". He also blamed ""a politics that tries to divide us and points the finger at each other, instead of at billionaires"". In a contrast with comments from Sir Keir earlier this year, who said the UK risked becoming an ""island of strangers"", Polanski said: ""This is a nation of neighbours."" He said defending migration was important to him because of his own ""confused and muddled"" Jewish ancestry, which saw his family flee from Latvia to Ukraine to Poland and eventually to England. Taking a moment to mark Thursday's attack on a synagogue in Manchester, where Polanski grew up, he said ""my heart is with the community."" In the past year the Green Party has built on its success at the 2024 general election - when it won four MPs - by winning 74 seats in the local council elections. Last month, Polanski was overwhelmingly backed by members in a leadership contest against the less combative duo of Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Since the election the party says its membership has risen by 20% to an all-time high of 80,000. Polanski, who is a member of the London Assembly but does not have a seat in Parliament, has expressed interest in working with the new party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Speaking after the leadership election, he said it was ""too soon to talk about joining electoral coalitions"", but he was interested in working with ""anyone who wants to challenge a failing Labour government and take on fascism and the far right"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y9nq174o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae45/live/a0ba2130-a061-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:51:35.614000+00:00,134dcec18ec417562e56e66eb70cb815d00c1415

He suggested Republicans should seize the opportunity to ""clear out dead wood"" and gave no hint of concessions to Democratic demands that legislation funding the government should include healthcare insurance subsidies. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, continued to blame each other for failing to keep federal agencies open. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are staying home, while others worked without pay. Some federal attractions closed to visitors while others, including the Statue of Liberty, stayed open. Watch: ""Find common ground"", tourists in Washington tell lawmakers amid shutdown Analysts don't expect either side to budge without pressure from everyday Americans, most of whom have yet to feel direct impacts on their lives. It was unclear exactly what Trump could decide in Thursday's meeting with Russell Vought, director of the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB). When Congress fails to keep the US government open, the OMB director works with the president to pick which government activities should stop and which are essential. It then gives directions to federal agencies about which employees to place on furlough, which means unpaid leave. On the first day of the shutdown, Vought said the White House had moved to pause or cancel billions of dollars in funding meant for Democratic states, including $18bn (£13.4bn) in infrastructure projects in New York - home of both Senator Chuck Schumer and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Both sides must come together to pass legislation if the government is to reopen. Republicans need eight Democratic senators to vote with them, while Democrats need 13 Republicans to side with them. Only three Democrats joined with Republicans on the last failed vote in the Senate on Wednesday. Lawmakers are expected to try again on Friday afternoon to resolve the impasse with a vote in the Senate. Republicans want to pass a funding measure without anything else attached, but Democrats want to include a renewal of health insurance subsidies for low-income individuals set to expire at the end of the year. Shutterstock Speaker of the US House Mike Johnson delivers remarks during a government shutdown press conference in the US Capitol in Washington on 02 October 2025 In duelling press conferences on Capitol Hill on Thursday, neither party appeared willing to give ground. House Speaker Mike Johnson called Democrats ""selfish"", dubbed it the ""Democrat shutdown"", and said he would not negotiate on adding insurance subsidies – or other measures - to government funding. Jeffries accused Republicans of not wanting to provide working-class Americans with healthcare and said Trump's threats to fire more federal workers were pointless. He noted: ""They have been firing federal employees all along."" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, said his polling suggested Americans were largely split down party lines when it came to assigning fault for the shutdown. Majorities of both Democratic and Republican respondents to his polls blamed the other party for the shutdown, he said, while 41% of independents said both parties shared the blame equally. ""Both of the parties have mastered the finger-pointing, and all we're left with is a growing number of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction,"" Miringoff said. He expected Americans to put pressure on Congress to reopen the government - but not until they see the impact of a shutdown on their own lives. Getty Images US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, speaks to reporters during a press conference at the US Capitol Building on 02 October, 2025 in Washington. As politicians traded barbs, US government services started to grind to a halt and thousands of federal workers stayed home. About 750,000 federal workers were expected to take unpaid leave, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Federal employees deemed ""essential"" continued to work, though without pay. They include more than 200,000 law enforcement officers. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers are considered essential, so air travel will not immediately be affected. During the last shutdown these employees increasingly began to call in sick, leading to some delays at major airports. Tourists were turned away from museums in Washington and New York, including at Federal Hall in Manhattan. A manager told the BBC the building was closed like other federal monuments. George Washington, the first US president, took the oath of office there in 1789. Now a museum, the historic building also was home to the first Congress and Supreme Court. But not all monuments are closed. Elsewhere in New York, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remained open, ""thanks to the leadership of President Donald J Trump"", a Department of the Interior spokesperson told the BBC. The Smithsonian, which includes more than a dozen museums and attractions that drew nearly 17 million visitors last year, told the BBC it had enough money to stay open for a week.

On Friday, a spokesperson for German flag carrier Lufthansa said ""flight operations have since resumed according to schedule"". There was no immediate confirmation of where the drones had come from. Several airports across Europe have closed down in recent weeks because of unidentified drones. Munich airport alerted authorities after the drones were detected. Departing flights were ""suspended"", the airport said , and it closed two hours ahead of its usual midnight to 05:00 curfew. Air traffic control redirected flights that were due to land in Munich to Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Vienna, and Frankfurt. ""Nineteen Lufthansa flights were affected, either cancelled or re-routed, because of the the airport suspension,"" the spokesperson said. Because it was dark, no information on the type, size or origins of the drones was confirmed, Federal Police spokesperson Stefan Bayer told the Bild Newspaper. The drones were first seen at 21:30 local time (19:30 GMT), and then again an hour later, police said. The BBC has contacted Germany's federal police. Meanwhile authorities in Belgium are investigating sightings of 15 drones, which were seen above the Elsenborn military site near the German border, Belgian media reports. After the sighting, the drones reportedly flew from Belgium to Germany, where they were also observed by the police in the small German town of Düren. It is not yet clear where the drones originated or who operated them. Recent drone sightings across the European Union prompted a leaders' summit in Copenhagen this week . 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland and Russian MiG-31 jets entered Estonian airspace in separate recent incidents. Copenhagen and Oslo airports were forced to close after unidentified drones were spotted near airport and military airspaces. Russia has denied any involvement, while Danish authorities say there was no evidence Moscow was involved. Speaking to a summit in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin laughed off suggestions he ordered drones to Denmark. ""I won't do it again. I won't do it again - not to France or Denmark or Copenhagen"", Putin said. Thousands of passengers were stranded at Munich overnight. ""Camp beds were set up, and blankets, drinks, and snacks were provided,"" the airport said. The city is currently hosting the annual Oktoberfest festival, which is due to end on 5 October. It attracts more than six million people a year, according to the official website. The annual beer festival had already closed for half a day on Wednesday after a bomb scare.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1e7j5ew9o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bfe7/live/25831280-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T08:26:10.243000+00:00,0d22d3dd6fd886496e51e42477b1e3be5dc90ffb
d5dacca26316,Baroness Mone accuses chancellor of 'inflammatory' language,,"Baroness Mone accuses chancellor of 'inflammatory' language Pritti Mistry Business reporter Getty Images Baroness Michelle Mone is linked to a company set up by a consortium led by her husband, Doug Barrowman, which was awarded a government contract in 2020 Baroness Michelle Mone has accused the chancellor of using ""dangerous and inflammatory"" language after a firm linked to her and her husband was ordered to pay £122m for breaching a Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) contract. During a fringe event at Labour's party conference this week, Rachel Reeves reportedly joked the government had a vendetta against the peer. In a letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone said her language was ""incendiary and has directly increased the risks to my personal safety"". She claimed she received ""threats and abuse"" on social media since Reeves' remarks. On Wednesday, a judge ruled that PPE Medpro's gowns did not comply with government standards. PPE Medpro was set up by a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman. It was awarded a government contract to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone. However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. Since Wednesday's court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage. She is currently on a leave of absence from the House of Lords and Reeves has said she does not want her to return. On Thursday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told BBC News that Baroness Mone should be stripped of her title . However, peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Baroness Mone demanded Sir Keir Starmer order an  ""urgent, independent investigation into whether ministers or officials have improperly influenced the NCA [National Crime Agency], CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and civil litigation process"". She also insisted the chancellor retract her comments. Baroness Mone told Sir Keir: ""I feel compelled to alert you to the dangerous and inflammatory statement made by your Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves."" She said the word vendetta referred to ""vengeance, feud and blood feud"" and that Reeves' comments had made her and her family feel unsafe. She also said her social media had ""gone into meltdown with threats and abuse"", adding ""we need only look at the tragedies of Jo Cox and Sir David Amess to understand the dangers of such reckless language,"" she said. Jo Cox was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen and was killed in 2016. Sir David Amess was the Conservative MP for Southend West when he was fatally stabbed in 2021. Concluding her letter, Baroness Mone said: ""Prime Minister, I ask you directly: do you stand by your chancellor's assertion that the government has a vendetta against me? Or will you act decisively to end this campaign, protect my safety, and restore integrity to government? ""Failure to take urgent action will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including defamation, harassment, and misfeasance claims, while also taking steps to ensure my personal safety and that of my family."" The Cabinet Office declined to comment. However, a Treasury source told the BBC: ""When both the Labour chancellor and Conservative leader agree with each other you've lost the argument."" Mone was made a Tory peer by David Cameron in 2015, but lost the whip following the revelations about the contract to supply medical gowns. The High Court ruled PPE Medpro failed to prove whether or not its surgical gowns, which were to be used by NHS workers, had undergone a validated sterilisation process. Following the ruling, Mrs Justice Cockerill said the £122m damages cost must be paid by 16:00 BST on 15 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9y5nkxpzlo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9197/live/5c8dfd50-9fbd-11f0-b73e-e715acbd6a10.jpg,2025-10-02T18:36:40.812000+00:00,f7f09a2cc1f4ad9948b3ee5327285f120385ffff
7085b0d42a07,Tesco warns 'enough is enough' on business taxes,,"Tesco warns 'enough is enough' on business taxes Josh Martin Business reporter Getty Images Tesco expects to make a profit this year of up to £3.1bn The boss of Tesco has warned the government against adding extra costs to UK retailers in the upcoming Budget, saying ""enough is enough"". Ken Murphy said he did not want to see a repeat of the last Budget, when ""the industry incurred substantial additional operating costs"". His comments came as the UK's largest supermarket upgraded its profit forecast for the year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will reveal her Budget on 26 November, with the widespread expectation that some taxes will increase. Many retailers have argued they have been hit with a wave of extra costs since April, including increased employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) and higher minimum wages. In addition, Tesco and other food and drink companies are now charged for the cost to councils of recycling the packaging of some of its products, under the government's Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) programme. The company said it had set aside £90m in ERP levies, which came into force last month. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) has predicted this tax will cost UK producers £1.1bn, more than the impact from the hike in NICs. Jim Bligh, head of corporate affairs at the FDF, told the BBC earlier this week that most of those taxes would be passed on to shoppers. ""So inevitably that means that food prices will increase as a result of these decision by successive governments over the years,"" he said. Mr Murphy said the new and higher taxes were ""an additional burden on the industry. As was the increase in NICs. As is higher commodity prices. There's a raft of factors impacting the cost of doing business"". Tesco said the higher National Insurance rate cost it £235m this year. Regarding the upcoming Budget, Mr Murphy said: ""Our one ask is don't make it harder for the industry to deliver great value for customers."" The Tesco chief executive's warning follows similar interventions from other retailers. Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium said that ""any further tax rises in the upcoming Budget would keep shop prices higher for longer"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The tax decisions we took at the Budget last year mean that we have been able to deliver on the priorities of the British people, from investing in the NHS to cut waiting lists and putting more money in their pockets with a wage boost for millions."" They added that the government has capped corporation tax at 25% and was reforming business rates. Mr Murphy's comments came as the retail giant upgraded its profit outlook for the year, saying it now expected to see full-year adjusted operating profits of £2.9bn-£3.1bn. Tesco said that although intense competition had led it to cut the price of 6,500 items, shoppers were adding more to their baskets and therefore its profits were set to increase. The Unite union said Tesco had ""profited from the cost of living crisis"". Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""As millions of workers struggle to put food on the table, Tesco is raking in huge amounts of cash and paying out whopping dividends to shareholders. ""It is time the Labour government stops being missing in action when it comes to tackling profiteering. Workers must no longer pay the price for corporate greed."" Shoppers 'worried' Mr Murphy said sales data suggested more shoppers were buying more fresh ingredients to cook meals from scratch, possibly in order to save money. The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew across all retailers at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge, official data for August showed. Mr Murphy said Tesco - which has about 28% of the UK grocery market - was raising prices at a lower rate than the market average. Households might be holding off on spending until after the chancellor sets out her tax and spending plans, Mr Murphy said. ""They are concerned and worried about the Budget and the economic outlook,"" he  added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c784q26v57vo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b8ca/live/39c71a80-9f82-11f0-9ccd-4dc2d8fa5ad2.jpg,2025-10-02T14:31:54.135000+00:00,8e945f2cf6ea412e001ef29b1e5538b14fbf5057
82ce7787a670,Denmark loses £1.4bn tax fraud claim in UK court case,,"Denmark loses £1.4bn tax fraud claim in UK court case Theo Leggett International business correspondent and Michael Sheils McNamee Business reporter Getty Images Sanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year Denmark's tax authority has lost a £1.4bn fraud case at the High Court in London in one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK. Skatteforvaltningen, known as Skat, argued huge sums of cash had been falsely claimed in tax rebates - as part of so-called ""cum-ex schemes"". The main named defendant in the case was defunct hedgefund Solo Capital Partners, run by trader Sanjay Shah, who was jailed in a criminal trial in Denmark last year . Ruling on the case, Mr Justice Andrew Baker said the Danish tax authority had not been misled into making the payments. The case was deciding on whether Skat was deceived into paying the tax refunds, as it had claimed. ""Greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here,"" said Mr Justice Baker. ""However, the evidence at trial did not persuade me to accept Skat's claim, and I do not make the findings it sought."" The judgement noted that of the 4,170 dividend refund claims between mid-2012 and mid-2015 examined as part of the trial, none were valid claims under Danish tax law - and all of them could have been rejected. However, Mr Justice Baker said the tax authority's ""controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be almost non-existent"". He said Skat had ""failed to established any of the claims pursued at trial where liability was disputed"". In a statement, the Danish government said its tax authority ""strongly disagrees with the premises of the judgment and is now seeking to appeal it"". How cum-ex schemes worked Cum-ex schemes were a method of exploiting weaknesses in tax regimes of different European countries and are believed to have cost European governments billions. They were carried out with the sole purpose of generating multiple refunds of a tax that had only been paid once. The schemes would work by taking advantage of the period when a company paid out dividends to shareholders. Shares would be sold by one investor immediately before the dividends were paid (cum, or with, dividend), and delivered to a buyer afterwards (ex-dividend) - effectively creating confusion over who owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. It allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued. 'Not trustworthy' Solo Capital Partners was founded in 2009 by London-based trader Shah. It was widely seen as a key player in refining and exploiting the cum-ex trade – with its activities focused primarily on Denmark. In 2023, he was extradited to Denmark from Dubai to face trial, and in December last year he was convicted, and given the heaviest penalty ever in Denmark for a fraud case . In Thursday's judgement, Mr Justice Baker said Shah was ""not a trustworthy individual"" and his testimony had contained ""implausible claims and obvious lies"". ""I do not consider it safe, in general, to treat anything Mr Shah says for himself or about the Danish dividend tax refund factory he created as reliable evidence of fact,"" said Mr Justice Baker. However, the judgement found while this information gave ""some indirect support "" to the case put forward by Skat - it did not prove the tax authority's case. The 18-month trial was the culmination of an eight-year legal process - with Skat initially being denied the right to pursue its claim in the English courts, before winning an appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal sources suggest the costs could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. It originally involved more than 100 defendants, including some 40 individuals and a number of corporate entities. Whistleblower Jas Bains Jas Bains thanked the court for its ruling The judge also rejected a claim against Jas Bains, a lawyer who worked at Solo Capital Partners as a senior manager between 2010 and 2013, before joining another firm that was also later implicated in the cum-ex scandal. Giving evidence in the trial in April 2024, Mr Bains said he later became concerned about the sheer volume of cum-ex trades being carried out, after hearing reports that Solo Capital was engaged in transactions of huge value. Through an intermediary, he contacted the Danish authorities in 2015 to warn them of what was going on and over the next two years, assisted the Danish police in a subsequent investigation. Despite his role as a whistleblower, Mr Bains was included in the wide-ranging damages claim from Skat and has spent years fighting legal battles. Speaking to the BBC after the ruling, the lawyer said: ""This unnecessary trial cost me eight years of my life and I'm grateful to the justice system for exonerating me.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy852vyn054o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0e4c/live/67b19be0-9f92-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-02T13:08:31.417000+00:00,9a751451003bc70d235ac468ddb8cd892d361f69
632804b1f800,Thames Water lenders submit rescue plan to stave off collapse,,"Thames Water lenders submit rescue plan to stave off collapse Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images Thames Water's lenders have submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the UK's largest water company from collapsing. London & Valley Water, a consortium of large financial institutions and investors, has submitted proposals which include writing off about a third of the company's near £20bn debt pile and investing an initial £5.4bn to stabilise its finances. Fears that Thames could collapse first emerged more than two years ago, and the government has been on standby to supervise a form of temporary nationalisation. But the firm's investors said its plan would rebuild the company without the need for any taxpayer funding or government support. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. But it has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years over a series of sewage discharges and pipe leaks. In May, it was handed a £122.7m fine, the biggest ever issued by the water industry regulator, for breaching rules on sewage spills and shareholder payouts. London & Valley Water said on Thursday that its plan was the ""fastest and most reliable route"" to turn around Thames, clean up waterways and rebuild public trust. Investors said they would inject an initial £5.4bn into the company to shore up its finances and support future investment, but they suggested the cash injection needed to be set against ""stretching but achievable and realistic performance targets"". All water companies are subject to performance targets over leaks, pollution incidents and customer satisfaction levels. London & Valley has argued the current targets in place for the company are unachievable and its current business plan needs to be adjusted in order for Thames to attract future investment, rebuild the company and improve its performance for customers. But Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water which represents billpayers, said Thames ""should not receive special treatment around performance targets at a time when customers are paying more and have a right to expect more for their money"". He said recent customer complaints showed Thames had made ""some progress, but remains among the industry's worst performers and is the country's least trusted water company"". ""The acid test of this proposed rescue plan is whether it would actually deliver improvements for Thames Water customers, many of whom are fed up with receiving a poor service,"" he added. Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who appealed against a previous rescue loan for Thames that was eventually approved by the High Court earlier this year, said the creditors' plan was a ""terrible deal"". ""The government must bite the bullet - put Thames Water into special administration with a swift exit which finally puts customers first, under mutual ownership."" London & Valley said under its proposals no dividends would be paid out to shareholders over the duration of the turnaround plan and that new shareholders would commit not to sell the business prior to March 2030. Outstanding fines would also be paid, they added. London & Valley Water said it aimed to reach an agreement with Thames and water industry regulator Ofwat ""as quickly as possible this autumn given the urgent need to stabilise Thames Water"". A government spokesperson said it was ready ""for all eventualities"", including a situation in which the company collapsed into administration. ""The government will always act in the national interest on these issues,"" they added. Mike McTighe, the proposed future chair of Thames Water under the terms of plan, said ""from day one, we will inject billions in new investment"". He added that under a new company board, there would be a focus on ""reducing pollution and rebuilding public trust so that by the end of this decade Thames Water can once again be a reliable, resilient, and responsible company"". Ofwat said it would review the latest plans. In response to the proposals, Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, said the announcement marked an ""important milestone"" in the company's work to resolve its debt problems and secure its finances to ""support the investment and performance improvements our customers expect"". The revised turnaround proposals come after Thames suffered a major blow in its attempt to secure its future this summer when US private equity firm KKR pulled out of a £4bn deal. In July, the boss of Thames Water, Chris Weston, said the company was ""extremely stressed"" and that it would take ""at least a decade to turn around"". Water bills for households in England and Wales have risen by £10 per month on average this year, although costs vary depending on suppliers. The bills for Thames Water's customer have gone up from £488 to £639 a year on average.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82pm40915o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4c6d/live/d88269a0-9f54-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-02T15:10:32.199000+00:00,2e80f5f6a2e5d09ca3cad9c487787e968644a5db

But more than a year later she has not received any of the money - despite using a government scheme set up to tackle employment tribunal non-payments. And she's not alone. Of the 7,000 people who have used this scheme, three quarters still haven't had their payment, data revealed as part of an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. A government spokesperson said the system was set up by its predecessors and ""every worker should receive payments they are owed"". Nadine told the BBC that taking the company she worked for, Peckham Levels Ltd, to a tribunal was ""probably the worst experience of my life"". Both sides told the BBC they made offers to settle, but the case went to a full hearing and Nadine was awarded £28,750 for detrimental treatment, £35,250 for unfair dismissal plus a compensatory award of £915. Weeks after the judgement, Peckham Levels Ltd went into administration, leaving Nadine with no way to recover her award. ""I've lost my sense of joy,"" she says. ""When you get told by a judge that you have suffered detriment, and you still can't receive that money – it kind of makes it worse,"" she says. The former director of Peckham Levels, Preston Benson, is currently the director of 12 businesses. In a statement, he said the distress the case had caused Nadine was ""deeply regrettable"". Mr Benson pointed out that he had ""no legal ability"" to pay the award once the company was in administration. No employers named The Employment Tribunal Penalty Enforcement and Naming Scheme was set up by the Conservative government in 2016, after a 2013 survey of 1,200 claimants found that more than a third hadn't received any money at all. Under the free scheme, companies face a penalty if they don't pay within 28 days, and since 2018 they can also be named online by the government. But of around 7,000 people who have used the scheme, more than 5,000 did not receive their payment or settlement, data from a Freedom of Information request suggests. The data indicates that despite more than 4,800 penalties being issued, with a combined value of more than £9m, the government only recorded 109 as being paid. It also suggests not a single employer has so far been named by the government for non-payment, despite nearly 4,000 requests being made. Rosie Davies now wishes she 'hadn't bothered' with the tribunal system Rosie Davies was awarded £6,000 in unpaid wages and breach of contract at an employment tribunal after she lost her job in motorsports. But 18 months later, she says she is ""still waiting for a penny of that money"". Claimants can also pursue their awards through the High Court – but the government doesn't track how many are successful. Rosie used both schemes to try to get her award from her employer, Christian Elvidge, who runs production company Motorflix Ltd. He hired Rosie through a separate firm – Motorflix Media Ltd. She was the only employee. Mr Elvidge was sent penalty notices and High Court enforcement officers also went to his house. But Rosie says that when Mr Elvidge declared Motorflix Media Ltd had no assets, he wasn't pursued further. The company is still registered, but has yet to file any accounts. 'The life I was making I no longer have' As well as the stress of going through the tribunal, Rosie says not getting the money ""tipped things over the edge"" for her finances, and she moved back in with her mum. ""I feel like I've gone back five years,"" she says. ""The life I was making for myself I no longer have."" Rosie applied to have her employer named online too – but hasn't been successful. She now wishes she ""hadn't bothered"" with the tribunal system. ""I thought the justice system would step in and make sure I received that money,"" she says. Christian Elvidge was contacted for comment, but did not respond. 'Completely broken' system Tens of thousands of employment tribunal cases are launched every year – although the vast majority are settled, withdrawn or resolved before it gets to a hearing. 491,000 claims were open in March 2025, according to the Ministry of Justice. Citizens Advice said the employment tribunal system was ""completely broken"". ""To have jumped through all of those hoops and then have a tribunal award that never gets paid is frankly scandalous,"" said policy manager Emer Sheehy. The Federation of Small Businesses is among those calling for the system to be ""overhauled"". Tribunals can be costly for businesses as well as employees, said policy director Tina McKenzie. ""There's currently more than a year's waiting list, and if the government brings in the reforms its proposing, it's going to get a lot worse,"" she says. She said the most common reason an award from an employment tribunal isn't paid is that the company becomes insolvent – something she says has been a particular issue in the post-pandemic years covered by the data. People who run limited companies are not personally liable for that company's debts. The FSB's Tina McKenzie says it's ""not ok"" that some people miss out on their awards – but argues that she isn't surprised when ""500,000 business have closed over the last four to five years"". She thinks there could be a case for a ""central UK pot"" that pays out those who are owed a tribunal award when a company becomes insolvent. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise it requires improvement as we intend to strengthen enforcement of unpaid awards as part of the Plan for Change.""

a81b62e73c9a,'My pay is being held hostage': Federal workers on US government shutdown,,"US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being ""held hostage"". Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts. A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits. What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending. BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them. Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named. ""The last shutdown was brutal"", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month. He added: ""It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills."" The same worker said: ""I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us."" Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: ""Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown."" He explained: ""The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained."" Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was ""rather conflicted"" and did not mind a break from the ""gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat"" of a mass firing. She said she would ""support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will"". Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: ""I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues."" He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was ""facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever"". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency. An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: ""I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL"". A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party. ""I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,"" she said.

2968f7b48176,Shein picks France to open its first permanent outlets,,"Asian fast-fashion giant Shein has chosen France as the location to open its first permanent physical outlets. It will occupy concessions in department stores first in Paris, followed by five others in the cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges. Shein told the BBC on Thursday that France's ""influential global fashion market"" was a ""natural choice"" as the firm's testbed for physical stores. The fashion brand has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions. The company has previously opened temporary pop-up stores in cities such as Madrid and Paris, but has never operated a permanent physical shop. The new outlets are being opened through a partnership with retail property group Societe des Grands Magasins (SGM). The French company runs the BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette department stores that will house what Shein calls ""shop-in-shop"" outlets. The outlets will create an estimated 200 jobs in France, Shein said in a statement, adding that the collaboration aimed to revitalise city centres and department stores in the country. ""By choosing France as the place to trial physical retail, Shein aims to benefit French customers and the wider retail sector,"" the firm said. This comes after the French Senate adopted a bill in June to regulate the fast-fashion industry by sanctioning companies, such as Shein and rival Temu, and banning their adverts. Shein, which ships to more than 150 countries, has primarily operated online through its website and app. Founded in China in 2008 and headquartered in Singapore, Shein has come under scrutiny over its production of fast-fashion goods . The business model rapidly produces low-cost clothes based on the latest styles, but has drawn criticism for its environmental impact. Concerns have also been raised about the working conditions within Shein's supply chain.

f82daf714245,White House says layoffs 'imminent' with no end to shutdown in sight,,"White House says layoffs 'imminent' with no end to shutdown in sight Watch: Federal worker layoffs to be ""in the thousands"" during shutdown, says White House Mass layoffs of US federal workers are ""imminent"" and could result in people permanently losing their jobs within days, the White House says, as a government shutdown continues for a second day. Lawmakers are trading blame over the shutdown - the first for almost seven years - under which thousands of workers have been put on unpaid leave. US President Donald Trump has called on Republican allies to use it as an ""opportunity"" to make more lasting cuts. The shutdown began on Wednesday, after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to agree a new spending plan. There is little sign of either side compromising and the next vote to try and end the situation will not be held until Friday. The Senate is currently adjourned, raising fears that the situation could drag on and threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as risk costing the US economy billions in lost output. At a White House briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Vice-President JD Vance made a rare appearance alongside Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt to accuse opposition Democrats of playing political games. ""If they are so worried about the effect this is having on the American people, and they should be, what they should do is reopen the government, not complain about how we respond,"" he said. Leavitt, meanwhile, indicated that mass job cuts could happen before the end of the week. Pressed by reporters about timeframes, she said ""two days, imminent, very soon"" and promised further updates. ""Sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to do,"" Leavitt explained, adding that ""Democrats put us in this position"". Trump previously warned that a prolonged shutdown could present him the opportunity to make irreversible cuts to ""Democrat things"". He wrote on his Truth Social site on Wednesday evening: ""Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud. Billions of Dollars can be saved."" His administration announced the same day that $18bn (£14bn) would be withheld for infrastructure projects in New York City - the home city of the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. Vance's comments represent the latest dig in what has been a bitter blame game between both parties, with the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer earlier accusing Republicans of trying to ""bully"" them into accepting a funding plan. Democrats want to secure guarantees on healthcare funding before they agree to a spending deal, while Republicans want to use a temporary stop-gap measure to keep the government open until mid-November and funded at current levels. Schumer and his allies say they allowed the government to shut down in an attempt to negotiate to save healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans. They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful. ""Why are they boycotting negotiations? I've never witnessed this in my life,"" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said of Republicans. ""The matter is the government will open when Republicans get serious about it talking to Democrats."" Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down Meanwhile, Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass a funding bill - have said these healthcare benefits are not the priority, keeping the government open is. ""It's not about who wins or who loses or who gets blamed and all this,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “It's about the American people. And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically."" Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist. Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave. In the past, these workers have then been paid retrospectively. Watch: Vance makes rare appearance at White House briefing Analysts expect this shutdown to happen on a larger scale than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills. They anticipate that roughly 40% of federal workers - around 750,000 people - will be put on temporary leave. Some workers were furloughed on Wednesday. At the White House, Vance reiterated the threat of permanent layoffs of federal workers. ""Let's be honest, if this thing drags on, we are going to have to lay people off,"" he said. Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown was a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants. US law already prohibits undocumented migrants from gaining any federally subsidised healthcare coverage. ""Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, briefed Republicans behind closed doors on what the impending layoffs could look like, although public details of those plans are sparse. On Capitol Hill, there was little appetite for a deal to end the standoff on Wednesday. ""There's nothing to negotiate. There's nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,"" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. Another vote on the short-term funding bill proposed by Republicans is expected on Friday.

add63874bb8d,Baroness Mone-linked company ordered to pay £122m over PPE contract,,"Baroness Mone-linked company ordered to pay £122m over PPE contract Rachel Clun Business reporter Getty Images A company linked to peer Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman has been ordered to pay £122m in damages after a judge ruled it breached a government contract for the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the Covid pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care sued PPE Medpro over claims the medical gowns it supplied did not comply with relevant healthcare standards. The High Court ruled Medpro failed to prove whether or not its surgical gowns, which were to be used by NHS workers, had undergone a validated sterilisation process. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it was beyond her powers for Baroness Mone to be stripped of her peerage. But speaking to Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live, Reeves said: ""I hope she won't be back in the House of Lords."" Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. While a life peerage cannot be relinquished, Baroness Mone could choose to resign from being a member of the House of Lords. Reeves said she would ""do everything"" in her power ""to get that money back"" and that the money belongs ""in our schools, in our hospitals and in our communities"". During the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the government scrambled to secure supplies of PPE as the country went into lockdown and hospitals across the country were reporting shortages of clothing and accessories to protect medics from the virus. In May that year, PPE Medpro was set up by a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, and won its first government contract to supply masks through a so-called VIP lane after being recommended by Baroness Mone. The judgement said the government later ordered 25 million sterile gowns from Medpro, which were delivered in August and October 2020, after being manufactured in China. However, just before Christmas that year, the Department of Health served the company with a notice rejecting the gowns and asking for a refund. The judgement said the government decided it was ""not satisfied that the gowns were contractually compliant"" after inspecting them, and claimed subsequent tests conducted found ""a number of them were not sterile"". Paul Stanley KC, representing the government, told the trial that of 140 gowns that were tested, 103 failed. It led to the government launching legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. Medpro, however, argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. Having previously denied gaining directly from the contracts, Baroness Mone, a former Conservative peer and lingerie tycoon, admitted in December 2023 that she stood to benefit from tens of millions of pounds of profit. She also admitted to the BBC that she and her husband lied about their involvement with Medpro to avoid ""press intrusion"". The court found firm's director Anthony Page called on his ""big gun"" - Baroness Mone - during negotiations in order to secure the gown contract. In the court ruling on Wednesday, Justice Cockerill said the contract between Medpro and the government was ""complex"", but found that the company did in fact have to demonstrate it had undertaken a ""validated sterilisation process"". ""That was not complied with by Medpro,"" she said. ""It followed that Medpro had breached the contract."" The ruling also said the gowns lacked the ""notified body number"" required to mark them as sterilised, and that Medpro had provided no evidence such a process had taken place. Medpro had also argued that the government could have sold the gowns if it no longer wanted them, or repurposed to be used as non-sterile or isolation gowns. During the case, the company said any lack of sterility or valid sterility marking ""did not prevent the said gowns from being used within the NHS or from being sold to third parties outside of the EU"". Justice Cockerill said there were problems with that argument, including the fact that the NHS did not need any more isolation gowns. However, she noted that the DHSC did not effectively reject the gowns within a reasonable timeframe, and also dismissed the government's claim for £8.65m in storage costs over lack of evidence. The judge ruled the company must pay £121,999,219 in damages, plus interest, however, it remains unclear how Medpro will pay the fee, with the company appointing administrators the day before the court decision. Its last set of accounts said it only had £666,025 of shareholders' funds. The court said the firm had until 15 October to pay the damages to the government. Speaking after the judgement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government was working with administrators and ""all different authorities"" to try and claim the money. 'A win for the establishment' In response to the ruling, Baroness Mone said it was ""shocking but all too predictable"". ""It is nothing less than an Establishment win for the Government in a case that was too big for them to lose,"" she said in a social media post. A spokesperson for Mr Barrowman described the ruling as ""a travesty of justice"". ""[Mrs Justice Cockerill's]  judgment bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month-long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile,"" the spokesperson added. Baroness Mone was once described as one of the UK's most successful businesswomen, creating the gel-padded Ultimo bra in the late 1990s. In 2015, then-Prime Minister David Cameron made her the government's ""entrepreneurship tsar"", and shortly after she became a Conservative peer. The next year she announced she was in a relationship with Mr Barrowman, a billionaire businessman who founded The Knocks Group of Companies and was a director of Aston Management Limited. In December 2022, Baroness Mone sought a leave of absence from the House of Lords. Neither Baroness Mone nor Mr Barrowman appeared in court for the decision. A separate National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into Medpro was launched in May 2021, into suspected criminal offences committed over the procurement of PPE. An NCA spokesperson said on Wednesday its investigation was ongoing.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1792rk7ynko,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4f30/live/60a20e90-9ec3-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-01T14:38:45.659000+00:00,badb5e2aa029580f3d1e2926a38d140a0ad96670

61ec5905de15,"Greggs set to raise prices again in response to cost pressures, says CEO",,"Greggs set to raise prices again in response to cost pressures, says CEO Josh Martin Business reporter Getty Images Greggs will raise its prices for the third time this year from tomorrow High street baker Greggs is set to raise the price of its breakfast meal deals and biscuits in response to growing cost pressures, the company's chief executive has said. Roisin Currie said the price increases would kick in from Thursday. She said the action was being taken in response to increased staffing costs, including the impact of an unexpected £20m increase in the amount it pays in employer National Insurance as a result of last year's Budget. It will be the third time this year that the sausage roll maker has raised prices, mirroring a wider trend on the UK high street. Both the two-part and three-part breakfast deal will increase by 20p each to £3.15 and £4.15p, respectively. The Greggs' boss said other price rises across other lines, like its biscuits would only be about 5p. Greggs' famous sausage roll will be unaffected in this round of price hikes, having already increased to £1.30 earlier this year. In August, Tesco increased its meal deal price by 25p, while coffee chain Costa has also increased hot drink prices this year. Despite these latest menu increases, Greggs remained ""the cheapest by far of all the other major high street coffee and sandwich shops"" such as Costa or Pret, Rathbones senior investment director Laura Lambie said. ""I suspect their customers are a lot more price-conscious so cannot withstand major hikes, "" she added. The baker chain will continue to open stores, and Ms Currie said there were opportunities to build more Greggs outlets in retail parks, roadside services as well as ""compelling opportunities"" to push further into southern England. ""Some were querying 'have we reached peak Greggs?' and we have gone out...to demonstrate that this is not the case,"" she said. Greggs has more than 3,000 shops across the UK. It plans to open a net 120 sites in 2025. Bracing for the Budget The bakery boss said she expected price pressures on the business to ease next year, but that the upcoming Budget could change that assumption. ""What's not helpful is when something comes out that surprises us - that's what happened with the National Insurance last year...it's quite hard to plan and manage a business when you have a £20m hit that you hadn't predicted,"" Ms Currie said. Last year's Budget included an increase in employer National Insurance aimed at raising £25bn for the government, which faced criticism from businesses . Ms Currie pointed to potential increases to the minimum wage as another reason why cost pressures and price rises may continue.

02f3f0765400,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned",,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned Nick Triggle Health correspondent AFP via Getty Images Price or multibuy promotions on unhealthy food and drink, such as ""buy one, get one free"" deals, are to be banned in England from Wednesday. The restrictions will apply to supermarkets, larger high street shops and online retailers. The measure has been under consideration for years but has been put off because of the cost-of-living crisis. Ministers argue the restrictions are an important step to tackle obesity – and in particular childhood obesity. The regulations also ban free refill promotions of certain drinks in restaurants and cafes. It will be followed by a ban on the advertising of less healthy food and drink on television before 21:00 and a complete ban on online promotions from January. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said the restrictions were a ""crucial step"" in giving children a healthy, happy start in life. ""Obesity robs children of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems and costs the NHS billions."" The government has introduced a classification system to define what food and drinks are classed as unhealthy, which is based on the products thought to have most influence on child obesity. So, in terms of drinks it includes fizzy drinks such as lemonade and cola that contain sugar. And for food it covers everything from crisps, sweets and chocolates to ice creams, pastries, cakes, and some fishfingers and pizzas. What difference will it make? Obesity rates have risen sharply over recent decades, with more than a quarter of adults and a fifth of children at the end of primary school classed as obese. Greg Fell, president of the Association of Public Health Directors, said this move should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"", but said it was long overdue, arguing it should not have been delayed from 2022 in the first place. ""Multi-buy promotions do not save people money – in fact, they encourage them to spend more. ""They are designed to encourage impulsive purchases and to normalise buying more and more frequently."" He said he hoped retailers would now turn towards promoting healthy products more, to make healthier choices easier and more accessible. Obesity rates had risen at an unprecedented rate over the years and were now a ""key driver"" of health inequalities as people in more deprived areas were nearly twice as likely to be obese, Mr Fell added. ""These are a long-overdue first step, but the government is far away from meeting its manifesto commitment to end junk food advertising to kids."" In particular he said there needed to be a tightening of restrictions on sponsorship of sporting and leisure events, as well as wider society investment to promote active travel and improve the quality of food in schools. There is evidence to suggest restrictions on the promotion and sale of unhealthy products can have an impact. A University of Leeds study published earlier this year looked at the impact of the one measure introduced in 2022 as planned – the ban on selling unhealthy products at key locations, such as checkouts, aisle ends and store entrances. Before the ban, 20 out of every 100 items sold were what was classed as unhealthy, while after that it dropped to 19. The researchers said this worked out at two million fewer products per day. Although it was also noted there was a downward trend for the sale of these products before the legislation was introduced and high rates of inflation could also have had an impact. There has been industry lobbying of government against the restrictions over the years. But some retailers, including Sainsbury's and Tesco, introduced their own restrictions some time ago. And Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, from the British Retail Consortium, said the vast majority of his members were already now compliant. ""There will not be a big change for them. ""Food retailers are supporting their customers to make healthier choices through better calorie labelling, reformulation of products, and portion control."" Wales is introducing similar restrictions next year and Scotland has said it will follow suit. Former prime minister Boris Johnson first announced a UK-wide ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat before 21:00 to help tackle the problem in 2021. The ban was later delayed to 2025, with the Conservative government saying it wanted to give the food and drink industry time to prepare for the change because of the cost of living crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d54gv44qo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d446/live/7365eac0-9e40-11f0-b0fc-395f3bc1ac43.jpg,2025-10-01T06:00:54.932000+00:00,ddadc3ba7ca1a0491aedec471bd261eee162b1b0
e2ef0115557b,Hurricane season brings financial fears in the Caribbean,,"Hurricane season brings financial fears in the Caribbean Gemma Handy Business reporter, St Johns, Antigua Getty Images Homes in Barbuda were flattened by 2017's Hurricane Irma For some Barbudans, thunderstorms still trigger flashbacks of the night in September 2017 when they lost everything they owned to Hurricane Irma's devastating winds . Eight years on, while memories may be close to hand, home insurance for many on Barbuda and other islands in the Caribbean's hurricane belt is more prohibitively expensive than ever. Across the region premiums have gone through the roof in the past two years, surging by as much as 40% on some islands, according to industry figures. Experts blame a perfect storm of increasing risk – as the region sees worsening and more rapidly intensifying cyclones – yet tiny populations of people to pay for policies, equating to poor returns for insurance companies. Dwight Benjamin's Barbuda home was one of few left relatively undamaged by Irma. After the storm, he invested in a one-room extension topped with a concrete roof that will serve as a shelter for his family should disaster strike again. ""I think the house should be sound enough but that's my added protection,"" he says. With peak hurricane season now in full swing, Dwight is among many Caribbean people anxiously monitoring weather platforms for activity in the Atlantic. Should a system head his way, he will do as he did during Irma – hope and pray. ""I've never had insurance; most Barbudans don't really think it's worth it. It's just an added expense to the meagre resources we have,"" he explains. ""Plus, we believe in what we have built and that it should be able to withstand the weather."" Courtesy Dwight Benjamin Dwight Benjamin built an extension to his home which serves as a shelter during hurricanes Like Dwight, many Caribbean people build homes ""out of pocket"", rather than opting for mortgages that can have high interest rates in this part of the world. And the majority of homes on islands affected by hurricanes are uninsured. In Jamaica only 20% are reported to have cover, and just half in Barbados. It is not just storms threatening the region, but earthquakes and volcanos too, points out Peter Levy, boss of Jamaican insurance company BCIC. As a result of these threats of natural disaster, which Mr Levy calls the Caribbean's ""unique market"", the cost of home insurance will always be high. One Antiguan insurance firm, Anjo, typically charges premiums of between 1.3% and 1.7% of a home's value. Whereas in the UK, for example, it can be less than 0.2%. Getty Images Hurricane Irma, pictured, is the most powerful storm to have hit Barbuda since records began The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November, with the most activity occurring between mid-August and mid-October. The northern Caribbean nations, such as Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, and the Dominican Republic, are among the most at risk of a direct hit. The peak months can be torturous for people with Irma-related trauma, says Mohammid Walbrook, another Barbudan resident. ""Whenever there's an announcement of a storm coming our way, it brings back bad memories. For some, even thunder and lightning are a trigger,"" he says. Back in 2017, Mohammid took shelter in a bathroom with his mother, father, sister and nephews when Irma's category five winds tore the roof from his parents' home. His own uninsured two-bedroom property was also badly damaged. He was one of several Barbudans to receive a new house through assistance from international donors. Courtesy Mohammid Walbrook Mohammid Walbrook survived Hurricane Irma While some Caribbean countries - like British territory Turks and Caicos, also battered by Irma - have emergency cash reserves that can help with post-storm restoration, others do not have that luxury. For deeply indebted nation Antigua and Barbuda, agencies like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are a lifeline in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The country's prime minister Gaston Browne estimated the cost of rebuilding Barbuda after Irma, where 90% of buildings were damaged, topped $200m (£148m). Help came from China, the European Union and Venezuela, among others. In 2017, the UNDP stumped up $25m for Barbuda and the island country of Dominica, which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria that same month. The money restored more than 800 wrecked buildings across the two islands. But the body's intervention was crucial in other ways too. With livelihoods destroyed, the UNDP's cash-for-work programme hired hundreds of local residents who had suddenly found themselves unemployed. They assisted with everything from debris removal to reconstruction of homes and infrastructure, including Barbuda's hospital and post office, the UNDP's Luis Gamarra tells the BBC. ""Injecting economic resources into affected families helps reactivate the local economy,"" he says. Almost 1,000 contractors were also trained in more resilient ""build back better"" techniques, to safeguard structures against future disasters. ""The climate is changing and putting more pressure on governments and communities. Storms are becoming more frequent, more intense and happening earlier in the year too,"" Mr Gamarra continues. He thinks the expansion of partnerships with the private sector and with other countries in the region might help mitigate the impacts. One such mechanism is the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, of which 19 Caribbean governments are members. Set up after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the first-of-its-kind risk-pooling venture allows member governments to buy disaster coverage at low cost. Last year it made record payments topping $85m to Hurricane Beryl-hit islands. In Antigua and Barbuda, hurricane preparedness is a year-round endeavour, explains Sherrod James, director of the country's office of disaster services. Assessments of buildings to be used as storm shelters, along with training of volunteers to man them, starts months before the season starts, he says. ""We also meet with the private sector, helping them put policies and preparations in place, looking at the safety and resilience of their buildings. We make sure our critical partners, such as the ports, are prepared. ""And we do a lot of proactive work to address chokepoints within waterways that can exacerbate flooding,"" adds Mr James. ""These days, storms can go from a category one to five in a day. The new norm has thrown out the old regiment of what has to be done; we have to be much more proactive now."" For many Barbudans, this time of year will always bring trepidation. Dwight was among dozens who recently attended a Hurricane Irma remembrance service at the island's Pentecostal Church. ""It was very touching and brought back a lot of memories,"" he says. ""This time of year, we keep an eye on the weather and our fingers crossed. But we are resilient people and we know how to survive.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lxvjypxreo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6dfc/live/2a9d06a0-9951-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg,2025-10-01T23:02:08.200000+00:00,0d796a3a8446cd5cb78b882988af2d29b6b1d1b2

Indeed, they are some of the most picturesque examples in the Netherlands, and easy to get to from Amsterdam. Last year, 2.6 million people visited - a gigantic amount for a small place with a resident population of just 100. It is far too many tourists, says the local council. And so, it has announced that from next spring it will charge every visitor from outside the area €17.50 ($20.50; £15) to enter, to try to control the numbers. It's very rare for a community to take such a measure, but talking to Marieke Verweij, director of the village's museum, you can understand why they want to do this. ""In 2017 we had 1.7 million visitors… this year we're heading for 2.8 million,"" she says. ""But this is a small place! We just don't have room for all these people!"" Worse, says Marieke Verweij, visitors often ""don't know that people live here so they walk into their gardens, they walk into their houses, they pee into their gardens, they knock on doors, they take pictures, they use selfie sticks to peek into the houses. So no privacy at all."" I leave the museum and walk past a coach car park in the general direction of the windmills. I probably shouldn't say this, as it's just going to make the problem worse, but these are some fabulous windmills. One of them is wooden and painted green. Another has thatched walls. Every so often the wind picks up and their sails go round. It's a fine sight - and one most people would want to get a picture with. A lot of people are doing just that, of course. The windmills are actually still quite a long way off but, at the best spots, visitors form very civilised selfie-queues. There's a bit of a queue also at a little bridge that leads over a canal towards the windmills. As I edge forward I hear Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian and Russian. The plan is to get everyone to book and pay online. The sort of thing you often have to do now to visit museums post-Covid. The sweetener for tourists is that for the €17.50 they get admission to two things they currently have to pay for separately anyway – entry to the museum and to the inside of the windmills. The former contains a painting of the local windmills by French impressionist Claude Monet, who visited in 1871. In the latter you can see how, in the 17th Century, the Dutch were using windmills not just to grind grain, but to do things like grind pigments to make paint or saw wood. The villagers complain of people walking into their homes If only half the current numbers keep visiting after the admission charge is introduced, annual revenues will be around €24.5m. The council plans to spend the money on maintenance of the windmills and on new infrastructure. New toilets, for example. But the shop and restaurant owners are not happy at all. The stores, it should be said, are a bit of an attraction in themselves. The staff wear traditional costumes in the cheese shop, they do clog-making demonstrations in the shoe store. And they are located inside old and beautiful wooden houses. The antique and gift shop for example, dates from 1623. The planned entrance charge is threatening the livelihoods of Zaanse Schans's retailers and restaurant-owners, says Sterre Schaap. She co-runs the gift shop, which is called Trash and Treasures. ""It's awful. It will mean that people who don't have a big wallet won't be able to come here,"" says Ms Schaap. ""It will mean that we will lose a lot of our shoppers. ""If you're with a family of four and you have parking, it will be around €100. So people won't have a lot of budget over for other stuff."" The village shops, where staff wear traditional outfits, fear a big drop in business I wander up to the windmills, past a young woman who's photographing her friend, and a couple from Germany who are taking a selfie. Up on the balcony of one of the windmills, looking out at the impressive flatness of Holland, I get talking to Ishan from Canada. ""I don't know if I'd pay the €17.50 to come here. It's a bit steep just to see a couple of windmills,"" he says. But Elisia, who is Albanian, grew up in Greece, and now lives in the Netherlands, says she would definitely pay that amount. ""These villages, they are not so big and they lose their charm when there are so many tourists,"" she says. Steve, who's over with his family from Massachusetts in the US, has been doing his calculations and can see the good side of the upcoming charge. ""Cheap people like me,"" says Steve, ""look at the windmill and say 'nah, I'm not gonna pay extra to go in there', but if it's all included I wouldn't hesitate."" It'd be a more complete experience, he says, and not a bad deal. John Laurenson Will the number of selfies go down when people have to pay to get into the village? The deal is also a sign of the times. Rachel Dodds, a professor of tourism at Canada's Toronto Metropolitan University, points out a few comparable cases. ""Bhutan charges an entry fee per day to visit the country. Venice, of course, is probably the most famous one with €5 for day trippers,"" she says. Meanwhile, the US and the UK both charge travel authorisation or visa fees for foreign nationals to visit them. Yet villages that charge entrance fees are still very rare. Current other examples are the privately owned fishing village of Clovelly in Devon, England, the medieval Civita de Bagnoregio and Corenno Plinio in Italy, and Penglipuran in Bali, Indonesia. As I wait for my bus to leave Zaanse Schans, a bus load of people arrive, swiping their credit cards to pay for their rides. Those who arrive in a few months time will be digging around for pre-paid entry tickets, too.

When US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last Friday to add a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applications for H-1B visas, a programme for skilled foreign workers, Abhishek Singh immediately worried he would have to relocate. Mr Singh, a software engineering manager based in the Seattle area, knew that his employer - a US startup - would not be in a position to pay the fee on top of his current salary. Mr Singh, who has been working in the US for ten years - the last seven of them on a H-1B visa - breathed a slight sigh of relief when the White House clarified on Saturday that for now, the fee only applies to future applicants. But his worries are an indication of the potentially far-reaching consequences of the change, as it creates new burdens for businesses, especially startups, with what some say could be significant fallout for innovation and economic growth. Abhishek Singh Abhishek Singh, a software engineering manager based in the Seattle area, has been working in the US on a H-1B visa for the past seven years. The H-1B programme is often associated with the giants of the US tech sector. Amazon tops the list of beneficiaries, with more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025. Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google each secured more than 4,000 visas through the programme through June. None of the companies responded to requests for comment. But while just 30 employers  - mainly big tech companies - dominate the programme, accounting for an estimated 40% of the new H-1B visas available , it is not just the behemoths that are poised to be affected by Trump's executive order. Startups, as well as smaller firms beyond tech, also employ workers through H-1B visas. For them, a six-figure fee per applicant could be crippling. ""If you're a startup with new technology, and you've got some venture capital money but you're worried about burning through it too quickly, this could kill you,"" said John Skrentny, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies STEM workforce development. ""What the Trump administration's plan doesn't seem to acknowledge is that not every company can spend $100,000 on a visa,"" he added. Beyond the technology industry, organisations in industries such as education and healthcare, both of which employ foreign skilled workers through the H-1B programme, are also grappling with what the six-figure fee might mean. ""There's no way that we can afford $100,000,"" said Karen Brady, the chief executive at Ryther, a behavioural health nonprofit based in Seattle. ""In terms of future hiring, we won't be doing any more H-1B visas."" The behavioural health sector has been grappling with a workforce shortage amid a spike in need since the pandemic, Ms Brady said. Hiring employees through the H-1B programme has helped address the crisis, she said. Ryther, based in Seattle, currently employs two therapists on H-1B visas, out of 45 total, Ms Brady said, both of whom are from China. Without those employees, there would be nobody on staff with the linguistic and cultural knowledge to communicate with families from similar backgrounds. ""They match some of our clients in a way that American workers don't,"" she said. ""I can't replace that."" Reuters In a research note, Atakan Bakiskan, an economist at the investment bank Berenberg, lowered his estimate for US growth from 2% at the start of the year to 1.5%, saying said the $100,000 H-1B fee is part of the Trump administration's broader ""anti-growth policymaking"". ""With the new H-1B policy, the labour force is more likely to shrink than expand going forward,"" he said. ""The brain drain will weigh heavily on productivity."" 'A great solution' In his executive order, Trump justified the new fee by referring to ""abuse"" of the H-1B programme, a nod to longstanding concern across the political spectrum that companies have used the programme to hire foreign staff at lower wages. His administration is also working on a wider overhaul of the programme, which is typically overwhelmed by applications for the roughly 85,000 new visas available each year, including a proposal to prioritise applications for higher paid workers. Trump's initial announcement won praise from some, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who broke from many of his fellow tech leaders, calling the fee a ""great solution"". Supporters of the change have said the major tech companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, that are the biggest beneficiaries of the programme, have the money to swallow the new charge. ""If these are really specialised people, and they're bringing in a lot of value, $100,000 shouldn't be a big deal for those employers,"" said Ronil Hira, a political science professor at Howard University who focuses on US immigration policy. But policies that make it harder for companies to hire skilled positions also often prompt firms to offshore their operations, rather than hire US workers at an equivalent skill level, said Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School focused on global migration and entrepreneurship. ""These policies really don't have the intended effect of balancing the labour market competitiveness of American workers,"" Prof Wang said. ""There's not a trace of data that suggests that American workers would benefit from this."" Elise Fialkowski is co-chair of the corporate immigration practice at Klasko Immigration Law Partners, which works with both startups and larger corporations. She said since last week, some of her larger corporate clients - many of which already have subsidiaries or branch offices outside the US - have started to ponder whether to hire talent in Canada, the UK and elsewhere instead. Trump's executive order ""almost begs companies to offshore work"", she said. Despite the reprieve, Mr Singh said he was still considering leaving his startup if he could find a job in his home country of India, or elsewhere - Canada, Japan, South Korea - worried the administration will continue to harden policies against immigrants. ""There's uncertainty now that anything can happen in the future,"" Mr Singh said. ""If we are forced out, then that's the only option we're left with.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzrl9kkkmo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bb12/live/828acbd0-996b-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg,2025-09-25T00:11:05.193000+00:00,e63fdd5ba9e61473a47e0b32fc4c5bc64b4c6791
fbb8069d46cf,Zimbabwe is tobacco country. But some think the future lies in blueberries,,"Zimbabwe is tobacco country. But some think the future lies in blueberries Shingai Nyoka / BBC Zimbabwe is Africa's biggest producer of tobacco but some farmers believe the country's long-term future could lie in a very different crop - blueberries. Thanks to a breakthrough in trade talks with China, the world's biggest importer of the nutrient-rich fruit, Zimbabwe has taken a major step towards achieving its ambition of becoming Africa's blueberry capital. Tobacco sales surged to a record $1.3bn (£1bn) last year, helped by the rising number of smokers in China. In contrast, blueberry exports were worth a more modest $30m but horticulture specialist Clarence Mwale is undaunted. ""The future is food, not a bad habit,"" he tells the BBC at his warehouse in Harare. For the first time, China has agreed to import Zimbabwean blueberries and, crucially, has exempted them from tariffs, in a boost for the southern African state's struggling economy. ""We have to strike while the iron is hot,"" exuberant blueberry farmer Alistair Campbell tells the BBC. Currently exporting to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia, farmers like Campbell would be gaining access to a massive new market, once Zimbabwe passes China's compliance tests on pest and disease control. A former captain of Zimbabwe's cricket team, 53-year-old Campbell co-owns a high-tech 50 hectare (123 acres) blueberry farm about an hour from the capital, Harare. Each of the 240,000 plants on the farm is grown in a pot imported from the Netherlands or South Africa. The pot soil is also imported. The plants are watered eight times a day, with specially treated water, and the blueberries are kept in refrigerators soon after they are harvested to maintain freshness. Campbell said that although it was a demanding fruit to grow, the rewards are worth it, especially as global demand is increasing for what some describe as a superfood, with high levels of vitamins and anti-oxidants. Campbell believes Zimbabwe can cash in on the rising demand, as the fruit comes into season early, in late March, hitting the market ahead of major competitors like Peru. ""It's all about Peru avoidance,"" laughs Campbell. Peru is both a bitter rival and an inspiration for Zimbabwe's farmers. In the last 10 to 15 years, it has gone from being responsible for less than 2% of global blueberry production to becoming the largest exporter of the fruit. Zimbabwe's production this year is expected to rise by 50% to 12,000 tonnes. Morocco currently leads Africa's production with more than 80,000 tonnes in 2024. South Africa, Zimbabwe's neighbour, produced 25,000 tonnes. With South Africa being severely hit by US tariffs, it is looking for new markets for its fruit, with China being an obvious one, especially as it has promised zero tariffs for all African states, except Eswatini because of its close ties with Taiwan. The Washington Post via Getty Images Blueberries have become increasingly popular because of their health benefits China has not yet agreed to take South African blueberries , raising hopes among farmers in Zimbabwe that they will enter the lucrative market first. The Zimbabwean and Chinese governments struck the deal earlier this month, offering what has been described as an ""unprecedented opportunity for local producers to access one of the world's fastest-growing blueberry markets"" . ""This agreement is a milestone for Zimbabwe's horticultural sector,"" says Zimbabwe's Horticultural Development Council executive director Linda Nielsen. ""We now need collaboration to design policies that increase investment, boost production, and ensure our blueberries meet China's strict quality and phytosanitary standards,"" she adds. Zimbabwe farmers are now looking for capital to boost blueberry production to 30,000 tonnes by 2030. Expressing caution about whether this can be achieved, Campbell tells the BBC: ""It's all good saying Zimbabwe is open for business but the underlying fundamentals need to be correct."" Many analysts say that more than 20 years after the government's controversial land reform programme led to the seizure of many white-owned farms, investors remain uncertain about the security of their land, despite a new law that does away with leases and offers full title to resettled farmers. With Zimbabwe experiencing a severe cash crisis, exporters are required to surrender almost a third of their foreign-currency earnings to the central bank in exchange for local currency - something that many Zimbabweans are loathe to do, fearing it will lose its value. Last year Zimbabwe generated $30m (£22.5m) from blueberry exports. The amount may be modest, but with unemployment high, the jobs the industry creates are welcome. It employs about 6,000 people, mostly women. Shingai Nyoka / BBC Rebecca Bonzo says blueberry farms are a source of employment for women ""It's delicate hands that are needed for a delicate fruit,"" Rebecca Bonzo, a supervisor at Campbell's farm, tells the BBC in the Shona language. ""Up to 300 women work during the peak harvesting season. Many are sole breadwinners who can now take care of their families,"" she says. Clarence Mwale - the founder of Kuminda, which represents a collective of small- and medium-scale farmers - says he is pushing more of them to become involved in blueberry farming. He says he has achieved this with other crops - for instance, about 5,000 small-scale farmers now supply horticultural products, mainly mange touts and sugar snap peas, to the UK and other European markets, something that was unheard of 15 to 20 years ago. Mwale says he is now looking for about 100 young farmers to diversify into blueberry farming and benefit from China's decision to open the market to Zimbabweans. ""As the Chinese market opens up…it gives us much more scope,"" he tells the BBC. ""Where we were scrambling and fighting for the European markets, which we haven't been able to fulfil, now we have a vast market that we have to fill. ""It gives everyone a chance to get into the blueberry production."" Zimbabwe has traditionally been tobacco country. But having fuelled a bad habit in China, it now wants to promote a health food there, hoping in the process to acquire the status of Africa's blueberry capital.

7807bacf5537,Global conflicts drive demand for war risk insurance,,"Global conflicts drive demand for war risk insurance Padraig Belton Business reporter Alina Kalcheva Natalia Grishko's balcony, top right, was badly damaged by the blast from a Russian missile With conflict continuing in Ukraine and the Middle East, a little-explored global industry has never been more in demand – the war risk insurance market. When a Russian missile damaged Natalia Grishko's apartment in a tower block on the outskirts of Kyiv last November she thankfully was not injured. Mrs Grishko's daughter, Alina Kalcheva, says the missile fell about 100m (328ft) from the building. ""The blast wave damaged my mother's balcony, windows, doors, and the interior of the apartment."" While her mum was ""of course very upset and cried"" to begin with, Mrs Kalcheva says she ultimately felt calm because they had insured the flat against such an attack. For while general household insurance doesn't cover conflict damage – whether you live in Ukraine or a country not under attack - Mrs Kalcheva had had the foresight to take out specialist war risk insurance cover for her mother. And the insurer paid out $1,000 (£740) to help cover the repairs. The annual premium or cost was $52, and the 33-year-old says she ""didn't hesitate to buy it. And as it turned out it was obviously the right decision."" Fellow Ukrainian Ekaterina Vasylieva even took out a war risk policy for her car in April 2024. That was particularly timely, because only a day later her vehicle was damaged by Russian shrapnel when it was parked in a street in the coastal city of Odesa. ""Only the day before I extended the comprehensive insurance on the car, and the manager offered for me to get insurance against military risks,"" she says. ""The cover saved me a lot because after the Russian attack the car looked like a sieve."" Alina Kalcheva Alina Kalcheva, pictured here with her husband and children, had taken war risk insurance out for her mother War risk insurance is the general term for a sector that also offers cover against terrorism. Industry experts say it has grown exponentially since the September 11 attacks in the US back in 2001. And while individuals can take out war risk cover, the vast majority of policies are bought by companies who wish to insure their operations, facilities and staff around the world. Especially in high-risk countries and regions. Although data is hard to come by for an industry that doesn't seek the limelight, one trade publication this year estimated that the global amount spent on taking out war risk insurance now totals about $1bn (£800m) per annum. And £621m, or nearly 80%, of that figure is said to go to specialist insurers in the City of London, which is the centre of the international war risk insurance market. Joanna Cousins heads a nine-person political violence and war team at one such London-based insurer – Westfield Specialty. She cites the example of a large energy facility in Iraq, owned by a Western company, which has been attacked multiple times in recent years. Mrs Cousins says that the owner ultimately bought more than £100m of war risk cover, without which it would have ""ceased or greatly reduced"" the operation of the site. People in the war risk market are not normally very keen to talk about how much a policy costs. But for a British or American company operating in Lebanon or Israel, ""currently, premiums are priced between 0.5% and 2% of the total cover they buy,"" says a senior London war risk insurance underwriter who asked not to be named. An underwriter is a finance professional who determines the level of risk of an insurance application, and then calculates what the cost of the cover will be. The 0.5% to 2% range means that if a business wants £100m of annual cover it has to pay between £500,000 and £2m. However, these rates will ""fluctuate significantly as the situation in different countries in the Middle East is volatile"", adds the unnamed underwriter. Premiums in stable Gulf states are said to be much lower, from 0.025% to 0.05% of the total amount covered. What is actually covered by a policy can vary. For example, a company can get cover for kidnappings and ransoms, treating serious injuries, or the cost of dealing with an ""active assailant"" situation. ""The market is growing in capacity and demand, "" says Daniel Hiller, underwriter, and group head of terrorism and political violence at insurer Munich Re Specialty. ""There are more perils customers can buy coverage for, especially around the active shooter product, but also strikes and riots."" Getty Images Conflicts in the Ukraine and Middle East have increased focus on war risk insurance Getty Images The City of London is the centre of the global war risk insurance sector War risk cover is organised in seven ""buckets"" spanning different severities of conflict. Sabotage and terrorism are considered to be the lowest, while civil and interstate war are the highest. ""Many insurers try to offer all this coverage, since often it's not clear where a situation has moved from risk of terrorism, to civil war, to even interstate war,"" says Raveem Ismail, founder of specialist insurance firm London-based Trigger Parametric. The war risk sector is centred on London due to the continuing strength of Lloyds of London, which has been a specialist insurance market since 1689. Lloyds is also home to war risk insurance reinsurers – firms who buy and sell the cover. Ms Cousins says this spreads out the possible exposure. ""Each [reinsurer] covers a certain percentage of the risk, of anywhere between one and 10%,"" she says. Constantin Gurdgiev, a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado, and an expert in the study of risk and conflict finance, says the challenge for the war risk sector is to work out what premium to charge for cover. ""Wars and conflicts more generally represent black swan [very rare] events,"" he says. Because of this rarity, he adds that ""historical data tends to be a weak basis for establishing any priceable insights"". Yet Mr Ismail points out that war risk insurance can be very profitable, something he contrasts with the car insurance sector. ""As a car insurer, for every £1 of premiums you take in, you pay back almost £1.05 in claims,"" he says. You might think that the maths doesn't add up there, but Dr Ismail says that the car insurers make the 5p and more from investment income. By contrast, war risk insurance funds can pay out as little as 2% . Put simply, car crashes remain far more common than war damage.

There are a number of steps you can take: secure any loose objects outside your property such as bins, ladders, trampolines and outdoor games, garden furniture and tools check fences and roof tiles are secure clear guttering of debris such as moss and leaves if possible, remove any loose or overhanging branches close and fasten external doors and windows secure storm shutters, if they are fitted to your home or business park vehicles in a garage, if you have one; otherwise ensure they are as far away as possible from buildings, trees and fences close and secure loft trapdoors make sure you know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water in case you have to leave your home, for example because of flooding charge mobile phones and any other critical devices including battery packs gather essential documents such as passports and driving licences, and make sure you have contact and policy details for your insurance company if you take medication, make sure you have a few days' supply If you are in a flood-risk area , try to move valuable or essential items upstairs or store them as high as you can on the ground floor. What should you do during a storm? Strong winds can cause damage to buildings, such as tiles coming off roofs, and heavy rain can lead to flooding. Public transport may be disrupted. People are advised to stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed. Unplug any non-essential electrical items in case of power surges. If you do have to go out, you should avoid walking next to buildings, trees and the sheltered side of walls or fences, in case of collapse. You should not attempt to repair any damage to your property or possessions while a storm is in progress. The RSPCA advises bringing all animals inside and ensuring you have sufficient food, bedding and fresh water. Listen out for bad weather warnings on local radio and TV, and check government and news websites for the latest updates. In you become trapped by floodwater, you should go to the highest level of the building you are in. Avoid attic spaces due to the risk of being trapped by rising water, and only go onto the roof if absolutely necessary. Call 999 and wait for help. What should you do if there is a power cut? If you lose electricity you make sure all non-essential appliances are switched off, but leave a light on so you know when the supply returns. You can report a power cut online or by calling 105, which is a free service in England, Scotland and Wales. Alternatively, you can find the details of your energy network operator by using this postcode search tool .

A survey completed by 1,250 people in Jersey showed 95% found the affordability of childcare was poor or very poor and 79% said there were not enough places. Ministers have announced plans to invest £4m in childcare but nursery owners have expressed concerns about the cost and the lack of staff to deliver it. Education Minister deputy Rob Ward, who published the survey, said ""evidence is clear that the cost of childcare is a real barrier for families"" and he was committed to making it more affordable and accessible. The research was commissioned for the government's Early Years Common Strategic Policy for the 2024 to 2026 period. The findings showed the three main barriers to being able to access childcare were affordability, availability and flexibility. It also found enabling employment and supporting child development were the two key motivators for parents and carers. Ward said the report would help the government shape a system that ""gives every child the best start in life"". ""As minister, this is something I care deeply about,"" he said. ""I have listened to parents and carers across Jersey and I recognise the challenges they face.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylw73wpezo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e801/live/d3c64f40-9fa3-11f0-8e4d-7723b0da5e04.jpg,2025-10-02T17:52:36.053000+00:00,3173ea07fd079310dd0c0dfca39fb8865e2fca13
f583afe14909,When is the Budget and what might be in it?,,"When is the Budget and what might be in it? Reuters The Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her plans for the economy when she delivers the Budget on 26 November. Before the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. But in her speech at the Labour Party Conference in September, Reeves appeared to suggest tax rises were a possibility, talking of tough decisions ""in the coming months"" . What is the Budget? The chancellor of the exchequer's Budget statement outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on health, schools, police and other public services. The statement is made to MPs in the House of Commons. Further details about Budget measures - and what they cost - are published by the Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors government spending, also publishes its assessment of the health of the UK economy and a forecast of what it thinks will happen in the future. What time is the Budget and what happens afterwards? The Budget speech usually starts at about 12:30 UK time - after Prime Minister's Questions - and lasts for about an hour. It will be broadcast live on the BBC iPlayer and on the BBC News website. The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will respond to the speech in the House of Commons. MPs will then debate the measures for four days, before voting on them. If approved by MPs, tax changes can come into effect immediately. However, the government must pass a finance bill to make them permanent. What might be in the Budget? There is lots of speculation that Reeves will have to break Labour's manifesto promise and raise taxes in the Budget because she needs more money to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances. Reeves has two main ""fiscal"" rules, which she says are ""non-negotiable"": Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament However, in its last report in March , the OBR said the chancellor only had a £10bn buffer to meet these rules, which it called a ""very small margin"". Since then the government has U-turned on planned benefit cuts that had aimed to save billions, while the cost of government borrowing has increased. Income Tax and National Insurance The government could extend the current freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028. Freezing the thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax or qualify for higher rates. This is often referred to as a ""stealth tax"". Speaking to the BBC in September, Reeves did not rule out extending the freeze. The Resolution Foundation think tank - which has close links to some members of the government - says some personal taxes will have to rise. As part of a package of measures, it recommended cutting 2p from the employee NI rate while adding the same amount to income tax. Such a move would potentially affect pensioners, landlords and the self-employed more than workers, as their tax would increase but they don't pay that rate of NI so wouldn't benefit from the matched cut. Value Added Tax (VAT) The Sunday Times reported that the government was considering scrapping VAT on domestic fuel bills - cutting the current 5% rate to zero. Health Secretary Wes Streeting ruled out introducing VAT on private healthcare . Property taxes Reports suggest the government may reform property taxes . This could include replacing stamp duty - a tax buyers pay on properties above a certain value in England and Northern Ireland - with a property tax. Landlords could have to pay more taxes, and council tax could be replaced. Some people selling their main residence may have to pay capital gains tax (CGT). Youth employment guarantee In September Reeves said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months will be given paid placements to help them secure full-time employment . More details are expected in the Budget. Isa reform In July, the chancellor ruled out any immediate reform to cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts). There had been speculation that she wanted to reduce the annual allowance to push people into investing in shares instead, to help boost economic growth. Other measures to encourage such investment are considered more likely. Pension changes There has also been speculation about possible changes to pension rules, such as the level of tax relief available to savers and the size of the cash lump sum which can be withdrawn. Cutting the higher rate tax relief on pension contributions would save the Treasury money, but may make pension savings less attractive. Business taxes The TUC, the umbrella group for trade unions in the UK, has called for higher taxes on online gaming companies and on banks' profits . How is the UK economy doing? The Labour government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority. A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. The latest official figures show that growth in the UK economy has slowed in recent months. The economy was flat in July , after increasing by 0.4% in June. Looking at the longer term trend, the economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, down from the 0.3% growth in the three months to June, and the 0.6% growth seen between March and May. In August, UK government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - hit £18bn, the highest level seen for the month in five years , driven by higher spending on public services, benefits and debt interest. Meanwhile prices in the shops are still rising faster than wanted. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - was 3.8% in the year to August , the same as in July, which is above the Bank of England's 2% target. In August the Bank cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year, taking the cost of borrowing to the lowest level for more than two years. It cut because of concerns that the jobs market was weakening,  with data showing job vacancies were continuing to fall and wage growth was slowing. However, the Bank held rates at its next meeting in September , arguing the UK was ""not out of the woods"" on inflation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w44w42j5o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8376/live/c5070a20-96b3-11ef-99af-372359b57a36.png,2025-10-02T13:10:05.084000+00:00,0078c0e8f3015efd228af9eab4e4e836700a6b51
df0e0fd4cc5e,Food bank volunteer proud to be praised by PM,,"A 79-year-old food bank volunteer has called being singled out for praise by the prime minister this week ""one of the proudest moments of my life"". George Sutherland, from Telford, has worked for Telford Crisis Support for the past 10 years and said: ""Demand has gone through the roof."" His work was recognised by Sir Keir Starmer in his speech at the Labour Party conference on Tuesday after his name was put forward by the town's MP, Shaun Davies. Mr Sutherland said he enjoyed the work he did and added: ""It's my happy place where I feel I'm helping people that have got less than I've got."" Mr Sutherland, who was also nominated by Telford Crisis Support, said he was invited to sit on the front row at the conference in Liverpool and he got to listen to some of the speeches. He also met lots of other volunteers, who he said were ""all similar people with the community at the heart of everything"". In his speech, Starmer mentioned Mr Sutherland alongside several other volunteers and described him as a person who ""delivers food parcels in Telford with a smile"". Mr Sutherland said the experience was ""absolutely wonderful"" and ""one of the greatest things that's ever happened to me outside of my marriage and my children"". But he also said ""this is not for me, this is for the Crisis Support"", adding he was ""no different from the person that started a few weeks ago"". Davies, the Labour MP for Telford, said on his Facebook page: ""George is amongst the best of us and why I'm proud of our town and proud of our country. ""His commitment has made a real difference locally and I was delighted to hear him named today."" Reflecting on the last year at Telford Crisis Support, Mr Sutherland said: ""It's getting harder as the cost of food is going up people are finding they've got less and less surplus money to spend and to give food to other people."" But he said his message to those in need was: ""If you need help don't feel ashamed to ask.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yqrq5ke7po,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/81ad/live/54239ee0-9f86-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-02T05:26:55.099000+00:00,406d1d9d0e7681dc9d3e0e890580bb8bc51da784
796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

4a67eeee64ff,The UK car industry is at a tipping point - can it be saved?,,"The UK car industry is at a tipping point - can it be saved? Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs. Behind it, the production line came to a halt – forever. The Luton plant began building cars in 1905. It kept operating for the next 120 years, taking time out to build tanks and aircraft engines during World War Two. But on 28 March, that came to an end. The factory shut down, a victim of cutbacks at Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis. Justin Nicholls, a production shift manager, was one of the 1,100 workers there - he had worked at the plant for 38 years. ""It was devastating, because it came out of the blue"", he says. ""It was a complete surprise."" It followed the closure of Honda's car factory in Swindon in 2021, and Ford's engine plant in Bridgend the year before. Together, they have come to symbolise an apparent long-term decline in the UK motor industry. Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images Vauxhall's Luton plant has been building cars since 1905 until production stopped earlier this year In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953. Output for the year is expected to be around 755,000 vehicles — lower even than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, described the situation as ""depressing"". The sector contributes some £22bn a year to the economy, according to the SMMT, and as recently as 2023 automotive manufacturing employed some 198,000 people in the UK. Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale. ""There is a critical mass of employment,"" he explains. ""Once you go below that, you see it all fall apart. ""You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on."" And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges. ""If we think about parts of the UK that have automotive plants, they're often disadvantaged regions,"" says David Bailey, professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School. ""Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy."" He is concerned about what has already been lost. ""I'd argue that actually we've let too much of this go already. I think once it's gone, it's really gone."" The question is, can the industry recover - or is it too late? A concealed deeper problem The UK car industry is sprawling. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers. In 2016, the UK produced 1.82m new vehicles – more than at any point since 1999.  Yet even at that point, storm clouds were already gathering. And the industry has suffered further over the past decade. Factory closures have had an impact, but other factors have been at play as well, including uncertainty over US trade policy, which has hit exports to a major market. Then there was the role of Brexit. Adam Vaughan/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the UK's leading manufacturers, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has deliberately moved upmarket in recent years, meaning it now sells fewer cars - also contributing to the lower figure of UK car production ""Obviously, Brexit had a big impact"", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. ""It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility."" As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles. The agreement with the EU to guarantee continued tariff-free trade soothed the industry's concerns when it came. But by then, there was another challenge to contend with. The pandemic caused havoc within the industry globally. In 2020, output dropped by nearly a third, hitting levels not seen since the mid-1980s. It also threw finely tuned global supply chains out of kilter and created shortages of vital parts. Although demand for new cars was spiking, manufacturers simply couldn't build them quickly enough. Reuters/ Chris Radburn 'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry. Quite simply, it has become an expensive place to build cars. Part of this is to do with labour costs. Although lower than in some other Western European countries, particularly Germany, they are around twice the level seen in Central European nations such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Then, there are energy costs. British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world. ""Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production,"" explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics. The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency. The investments starting to bear fruit When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year. A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production. Of those who have not relocated, some retired. ""[Others] are taking quite a reduction in pay"", says Gary Reay, who was a representative of the Unite union at the plant. The factory site has been bought by a property firm, Goodman - it plans to create more than 1,700 jobs at a new industrial park. Mr Reay is unimpressed. ""The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers."" Toby Melville/PA Wire Just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025 Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit. In 2024, for example, Nissan stopped building its ageing electric Leaf model at its Sunderland plant — having previously been building about 30,000 a year. But it is due to begin making a new version this year and will start building an electric version of the Juke in 2026. Nissan is also one of the manufacturers set to benefit from investments in gigafactories. Nissan's battery partner AESC is building one in Sunderland, which will be able to make power packs for 100,000 electric vehicles a year. JLR's parent company, Tata, meanwhile, is investing in its own plant in Somerset, through its subsidiary Agratas. The government says it wants to increase the number of cars and commercial vehicles built annually to 1.3m by 2035. The SMMT believes 803,000 vehicles will leave the production lines next year but bringing that up to 1.3m looks like a very tall order, according to Mike Hawes. Greg McDonald, the CEO of Goodfish Group, is also circumspect. ""I don't think many people think there's going to be a resurgence,"" he says. His business makes injection moulded components for carmakers and has four sites across the UK. It also has a base in Slovakia. ""Suppliers like us are used to being constantly bid at for price and cost reductions, and there's a limit to how much you can do."" Diversifying or Chinese investment? One way of mitigating this is for businesses to diversify - something more viable for smaller businesses in the sector. Burnett's Manufacturing, based in Northampton, is one of many automotive suppliers clustered around the Midlands Corridor. A manufacturer of specialist rubber and plastic parts, it relies on the motor industry for about 40% of its business. But it also provides components for shipbuilders and oil and gas firms. According to technical sales manager, Rich Dixon, smaller companies are more flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances. ""I think we're lucky in some ways, because 60% of our business is diversified across many different industries,"" he says. ""The last thing you want to be is 100% automotive. ""The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive."" Yang Dong/VCG via Getty Images Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market. ""If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry,"" argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies. This would, he adds, require significant government action, including negotiations with Beijing. The question is, is it already too late? One senior executive, who has spent decades in the European industry, doesn't believe the UK will become a major player in the EV market. ""I don't think governments have spent the necessary time and energy preparing for the shift to EVs. Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images The UK is home to a number of luxury car firms, such as Bentley ""I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in,"" says the executive, who asked not to be named. ""It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand."" Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars. This could mean becoming a hub for the production of luxury Chinese designs, while allowing cheaper mass-market models to be built elsewhere. ""I think people globally are willing to pay a premium for a British-made luxury car,"" adds Prof Bailey. The Great British 'brain drain' There is plenty at stake here, and it goes beyond the impact on local communities when factories are lost or suppliers stop trading. ""I also worry about it in terms of impacts on productivity, exports, and research and development,"" says Prof Bailey. ""Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go."" This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. ""We tend not to support our homegrown industries in the same way that other countries do"". What is harder to assess is the loss of national prestige. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry. This became even more marked when MG – a classic British brand – became a boutique badge for cars made in China. Bloomberg via Getty Images ‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’ Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. Think of Rolls Royce, Bentley, McLaren and Lotus. Even BMW-Mini, a mass market manufacturer, is more than willing to wave the Union Jack – or rather, have it painted on door mirrors and roofs. If those cars were no longer built in Britain, it might well be perceived as a national humiliation. And for some, the decline of the auto industry would almost certainly be perceived as a symptom of a much wider loss. ""I do think people are [becoming] much more aware of where things are made,"" argues Mr Fowler. ""This isn't necessarily a nationalistic thing, but more a sustainability thing. Do you want your car to have travelled halfway around the world to reach you?"" Ultimately, he says, there is already ""a bit of a brain drain of talent, because the opportunities, bluntly, aren't here in the UK. ""[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else.""

95dccc61b996,Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price,,"Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent and Dharshini David Deputy economics editor BBC In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic. Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered. At least, so far. Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases. Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt. What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term. The '90 deals in 90 days' deadline For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs. While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted ""90 deals in 90 days"" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was. By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/Pool The baseline 10% applied to most British goods raised eyebrows at first – but was a relief compared to the 15% rate on other trading partners The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK. While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone. And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs. South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt ""thank you for your attention to this matter"". Capacity to 'damage' the global economy Much has been revealed as a result of this. First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised. JOHN G MABANGLO/EPA/Shutterstock The greatest fears - the warnings of potential disaster - have receded Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse. For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers. That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Trump hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals equated with tearing down trade barriers in the past But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago. Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades. The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to ""damage"" the global economy in several ways. ""They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,"" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods. Winners and losers: Germany, India and China It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor. The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year. That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US recently, after fears of what may lie in store for China Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production. On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries. Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere. And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line. For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. A very real political threat for Trump? As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too. Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year. Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year. American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them. Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain. Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval. It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections. The deals yet to be hammered out Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved. Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning. Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on. In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president. YURI GRIPAS/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Trump's overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the ""devil is in the detail"" – and the details are light. It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots. But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally. Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US. Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth. Additional reporting: Michael Race.

431b4f0ce0b4,"Labour might be down, but it's not necessarily out - voters reflect on a year in power",,"Labour might be down, but it's not necessarily out - voters reflect on a year in power Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""There's only one relationship that really matters,"" a senior figure in government told me in the middle of Labour's dreadful week, where ministers lost control of their backbenchers. ""It's the one with the voters."" Well, quite. And that relationship has soured since Labour has been in power. After days of frenzied coverage in Westminster around an anniversary the party might rather forget, what is the state of that vital relationship? We gathered a group of Labour's 2024 voters together to delve into what's gone wrong, according to those who matter the most – the public. Our participants were from two constituencies in Kent: Dartford and Gravesham. Both seats were won by Labour in the heady days of July 2024, thanks not only to Labour's campaign itself, but the collapse of the Conservative vote. And the swing to Sir Keir Starmer's party in both places was enormous, nearly 20%. Our panel was selected by the political research group, More in Common, and the questions were asked to the group not by me, but by its director, Luke Tryl. Jack Hill/The Times/PA Wire It's worth knowing too, when our panel was recruited, they were not told they would be asked about politics. It could have been for any other market research exercise, for washing powder or water bills, rather than anything to do with Westminster - so it wasn't a gathering of political junkies. But our group, who all voted Labour last time, certainly had a strong sense of what has happened to the government they elected just twelve months ago, and it wasn't pretty. First of all, we asked the group about their impressions of Labour's first year back in office, overall. The overwhelming sense, and one of the words used most often, was ""disappointed"". From top left (L-R): Yvette, Kirsty, Ramesh, Hayley. On the bottom row (L-R): Adam, Veronica, Kelly and Sodiq ""I've always been Labour, but I expected much more from them,"" Yvette, who's 57 and a nutritionist said. ""I thought they'd be there for the people."" Kelly is 35, and a stay-at-home mum. She was frustrated about what she sees as a lack of progress on immigration. ""Everything they promised, nothing has come of it yet,"" Kelly said. ""Immigration is a big thing for me."" Adam, is an illustrator aged 37. He was a bit more forgiving of Sir Keir's problems: ""They are patching things up, the first year is not the year to push the big ideas, let's steady the ship."" But 30-year-old Sodiq, who owns his own business, reckons Labour hadn't been completely straight about what its plans were to start with. ""I think a lot of the things that were promised were never going to happen,"" Sodiq said. Kirsty, who's 35 and a teacher, even told us, ""I feel lied to"". House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire What about the chaos of Parliament this week, and Labour's many changes of direction since they've been in office? The group had definitely noticed what had gone on in the last seven days, not always the case when it comes to shenanigans in SW1. Veronica, a 64-year-old carer, had seen the chancellor's tears and had some sympathy. ""I think she's trying her best - there are going to be teething problems, it's only the first year."" But she said, ""crying at the Commons the other day and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did? Sometimes I think, 'Is it the pressure getting to her?'"". Hayley, who is a personal assistant, was also dubious that Sir Keir didn't notice, but reckons the government deserves more time. ""You can't turn the country round in a year,"" the 40-year-old said. But it was clear the group had reservations about Labour's repeated shifts in position - whether on welfare this week, or winter fuel before. While praising Sir Keir for listening, Adam said: ""What happened this week - another U-turn - was worrying, it pushes the idea that there is no direction."" Yvette said ""if he makes a decision he should stand by it"", changes of heart were like ""lastminute.com"". Jacob King/PA Wire In the general election there were big shifts towards Reform UK, even though they didn't win either the Dartford or Gravesham seat. But Kent was one of the 10 councils Farage's party took control of in the local elections this May. Reform's progress has certainly been noticed. Kelly said: ""They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive."" Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round. ""If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,"" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though ""a lot of bad things are said about him"". Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire But Sodiq said: ""I'm at the other end of the scale. He's a politician, like others, who says things people want to hear, and people generally are not comfortable with the two main parties, and just want to try something else."" Labour is worried by their grisly position in the polls, and there's something of a sense of bewilderment too about just how shaky things have got in the last few weeks. But at senior levels, sources believe if they keep on keeping on, eventually, many voters like those we met this weekend will return to them if hopes for improvements in the NHS and the economy come to pass. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Watch tomorrow to hear the advice that our group would give Sir Keir Starmer in order to improve, to make that happen. Of course this is only a taste of what's on some voter's minds in just  two constituencies, but the mood was certainly disappointed with what has, and has not happened since Labour moved back into power. But there was a sense, a grudging willingness among these Labour voters to give Sir Keir and the government more time. After twelve months, Labour is most certainly down, but not necessarily out.

b35a5827e0be,China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost?,,"China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost? Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC Listen to Theo read this article In China, they call it the Seagull, and it has looks to match. It is sleek and angular, with bright, downward-slanting headlights that have more than a hint of mischievous eyes about them. It is, of course, a car. A very small one, designed as a cheap city runabout – but it could have huge significance. Available in China since 2023, where it has proved extremely popular, it has just been launched in Europe with the name Dolphin Surf (because Europeans apparently aren't as keen on seagulls as Chinese people). When it goes on sale in the UK this week, it's expected to have a price tag of around £18,000. That will still make it, for an electric car on western markets, very cheap indeed. It won't be the outright lowest-priced model on offer: the Dacia Spring, manufactured in Wuhan jointly by Renault and Dongfeng, and the Leapmotor T03, which is being produced by a joint venture between Chinese startup Leapmotor and Stellantis, both cost less. But the Dolphin Surf is the new arrival that has long-established brands most worried. That is because the company behind it has been making ever bigger waves on international markets. Bloomberg via Getty The BYD Dolphin Surf will be priced at around £18,000 in the UK - ultra cheap for an EV BYD is already the biggest player in China. It overtook Tesla in 2024 to become the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs), and since entering the European markets two years ago, it has expanded aggressively. ""We want to be number one in the British market within 10 years,"" says Steve Beattie, sales and marketing director for BYD UK. BYD is part of a wider expansion of Chinese companies and brands that some believe could change the face of the global motor industry – and which has already prompted radical action from the US government and the EU. It means once-unknown marques like Nio, Xpeng, Zeekr or Omoda could become every bit as much household names as Ford or Volkswagen. They will join classic brands such as MG, Volvo and Lotus, which have been under Chinese ownership for years. The products on offer already encompass a huge range, from runabouts like the tiny Dolphin Surf to exotic supercars, like the pothole-jumping U9, from BYD's high-end sub-brand Yangwang. ""Chinese brands are making massive inroads into the European market,"" says David Bailey, professor of business and economics at Birmingham Business School. In 2024, 17 million battery and plug-in hybrid cars were sold worldwide, 11 million of those in China. Chinese brands, meanwhile, had 10% of global EV and plug-in hybrid sales outside their home country, according to the consultancy Rho Motion. That figure is only expected to grow. For consumers, it should be good news – leading to more high-quality and affordable electric cars becoming available. But with rivalry between Beijing and western powers showing no sign of subsiding, some experts are concerned Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk from hackers and third parties. And for established players in Europe, it represents a formidable challenge to their historic dominance. ""[China has] a huge cost advantage through economies of scale and battery technology. European manufacturers have fallen well behind,"" warns Mr Bailey. ""Unless they wake up very quickly and catch up, they could be wiped out."" Cut-throat competition in China China's car industry has been developing rapidly since the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But that process accelerated rapidly in 2015, when the Communist Party introduced its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative. The 10-year plan to make the country a leader in several high-tech industries, including EVs, attracted intense criticism from abroad, and particularly the US, amid claims of forced technology transfers and theft of intellectual property – all of which the Chinese government denies. Fuelled by lavish state funding, the plan helped lay the groundwork for the breakneck growth of companies like BYD – originally a maker of batteries for mobile phones – and allowed the Chinese parent companies of MG and Volvo, SAIC and Geely, to become major players in the EV market. ""The general standard of Chinese cars is very, very high indeed,"" says Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK. ""China has learned extremely quickly how to manufacture cars."" Yet competition in China has become ever more cut-throat, with brands jostling for space in an increasingly saturated market. This has led them to hunt for sales elsewhere. While Chinese firms have expanded into East Asia and South America, for years the European market proved a tough nut to crack – that is, until governments here decided to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models. The transition to electric cars opened the door to new players. ""[Chinese brands] have seen an opportunity to get a bit of a foothold,"" says Oliver Lowe, UK product manager of Omoda and Jaecoo, two sub brands of the Chinese giant Chery. STR via Getty BYD overtook Tesla in 2024 to become the world's biggest-selling EV manufacturer Low labour costs in China, coupled with government subsidies and a very well-established supply chain, have given Chinese firms advantages, their rivals have claimed. A report from the Swiss bank UBS, published in late 2023, suggested that BYD alone was able to build cars 25% more cheaply than western competitors. Chinese firms deny the playing field is uneven. Xpeng's vice chairman Brian Gu told the BBC at the Paris Motor Show in 2024 that his company is competitive ""because we have fought tooth and nail through the most competitive market in the world"". 'Naked protectionism' from the US? Concerns that Chinese EV imports could flood international markets at the expense of established manufacturers reached fever pitch in 2024. In the US, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned they could prove to be an ""extinction-level event"" for the US industry, while the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen suggested that ""huge state subsidies"" for Chinese firms were distorting the European market. The Biden administration took dramatic action, raising import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs from 25% to 100%, effectively making it pointless to sell them in the US. It was condemned by Beijing as ""naked protectionism"". REUTERS/Leah Millis The Biden administration raised import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to 100% in 2024 Meanwhile, in October 2024, the EU imposed extra tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese-made EVs. The UK, however, took no action. Matthias Schmidt, founder of Schmidt Automotive Research, says the EU's tariffs have now made it harder for Chinese firms to gain market share. ""The door was wide open in 2024... but the Chinese failed to take their chance. With the tariffs in place, Chinese manufacturers are now unable to push their cost advantage onto European consumers."" Renault's ultra-modern EV hub European manufacturers have been racing to develop their own affordable electric cars. French car-maker Renault is among them. At its factory in Douai, in northeastern France, an army of spark-spitting robots weld sections of steel to form car bodies, while on the main assembly line, automated systems mate together bodyshells, doors, batteries, motors and other parts, before human workers apply the finishing touches. The factory has been making cars for Renault since 1974, but four years ago, the ageing production lines were replaced with new highly automated, digitally-controlled systems. Part of the site was also taken over by the Chinese-owned battery firm AESC, which built its own ""gigafactory"" next door. Renault This Renault plant is adopting production techniques used by some Chinese manufacturers It's part of Renault's wider plan to set up an ultra-modern EV ""hub"" in northern France. Mirroring the lean production techniques of Chinese manufacturers, the hub cuts costs by maximising efficiency and ensuring that suppliers are located as close as possible. ""Our target was to be able to produce affordable electric cars here to sell in Europe,"" explains Pierre Andrieux, director of the Douai plant, arguing that automated processes ""will enable us to do that profitably"". But the company is also exploiting something the Chinese brands do not have: heritage. Its latest model, the Renault 5 E-tech, built in Douai, borrows its name from one of the company's most famous products. Getty Images and Renault The original Renault 5 - which the new Renault 5 E-Tech emulates - became a cult classic The original Renault 5, launched in 1972, was a quirky little everyman car with boxy looks and low running costs that became a cult classic. The new design, despite being a state-of-the art EV, pays homage to its predecessor in name and appearance, in an effort to emulate its popular appeal. Security, spyware and hacking concerns But irrespective of how desirable Chinese cars are in comparison with European rivals, some experts believe we should be wary of them – for security reasons. Most modern vehicles are internet-enabled in some way – to allow satellite navigation, for example – and drivers' phones are often connected to car systems. Pioneered by Tesla, so-called ""over-the-air updates"" can upgrade a car's software remotely. This has all led to concerns, in some quarters, that cars could be hacked and used to harbour spyware, monitor individuals or even be immobilised at the touch of a keyboard. Getty Images Tesla pioneered ""over-the-air updates"" allowing software to be updated remotely Earlier this year, a British newspaper reported that military and intelligence chiefs had been ordered not to discuss official business while riding in EVs; it was also alleged that cars with Chinese components had been banned from sensitive military sites. Then in May, a former head of the intelligence service MI6 claimed that Chinese-made technology in a range of products, including cars, could be controlled and programmed remotely. Sir Richard Dearlove warned MPs that there was the potential to ""immobilise London"". Beijing has always denied all accusations of espionage. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London says that the recent allegations are ""entirely unfounded and absurd"". ""China has consistently advocated the secure, open, and rules-based development of global supply chains,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""Chinese enterprises operating around the world are required to comply with local laws and regulations. ""To date, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Chinese EVs pose a security threat to the UK or any other country."" Chinese government is 'not hell-bent on surveillance' Joseph Jarnecki, research fellow at defence and security think-tank The Royal United Services Institute, argues that potential risks can be mitigated. ""Chinese carmakers exist in this highly competitive market. While they're beholden to Chinese law and that may require compliance with national security agencies, none of them want to damage their ability to grow and to have international exports by being perceived as a security risk,"" he says. ""The Chinese government equally is conscious of the need for economic growth. They're not hell-bent on solely conducting surveillance."" But the car industry is just one area in which Chinese technology is becoming increasingly enmeshed in the UK economy. To achieve the government's climate objectives, for instance, ""It will be necessary to use Chinese-supplied technology"", adds Mr Jarnecki. He believes that regulators of key industries should be given sufficient resources to monitor cyber security and advise companies using Chinese products of any potential issues. As for electric cars powered by Chinese technology, there's no question that they're here to stay. ""Even if you have a car that's made in Germany or elsewhere, it probably contains quite a few Chinese components,"" says Dan Caesar. ""The reality is most of us have smartphones and things from China, from the US, from Korea, without really giving it a second thought. So I do think there's some fearmongering going on about what the Chinese are capable of. ""I think we have to face the reality that China is going to be a big part of the future.""

a96354175d36,The true extent of cyber attacks on UK business - and the weak spots that allow them to happen,,"The true extent of cyber attacks on UK business - and the weak spots that allow them to happen Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC The first day of September should have marked the beginning of one of the busiest periods of the year for Jaguar Land Rover. It was a Monday, and the release of new 75 series number plates was expected to produce a surge in demand from eager car buyers. At factories in Solihull and Halewood, as well as at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, staff were expecting to be working flat out. Instead, when the early shift arrived, they were sent home. The production lines have remained idle ever since. Though they are expected to resume operations in the coming days, it will be in a slow and carefully controlled manner. It could be another month before output returns to normal. Such was the impact of a major cyber attack that hit JLR at the end of August. It is working with various cyber security specialists and police to investigate, but the financial damage has already been done. Over a month's worth of worldwide production was lost. Analysts have estimated its losses at £50m per week. Getty Images JLR's production lines were left idle after the firm faced a cyber attack at the end of August For a company that made a £2.5bn profit in the last financial year, and which is owned by the Indian giant Tata Group, the losses should be painful but not fatal. But JLR is not an isolated incident. So far this year there has been a wave of cyber attacks targeting big businesses, including retailers such as Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, as well as a key airport systems provider. Other high profile victims have included the children's nursery chain Kido, while last year incidents involving Southern Water and a company that provided essential blood tests to the NHS raised serious concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and services. In all, a government run survey on cyber security breaches estimates 612,000 businesses and 61,000 charities were targeted across the UK. So just how much are attacks like these costing businesses and the economy? And could it be, as one expert analyst puts it, that this year's major attacks are the result of a ""cumulative effect of a kind of inaction"" on cyber security from the government and businesses that is now starting to bite? Pyramid of suppliers affected What is significant about an attack on the scale of the one that hit JLR is just how far the consequences can stretch. The company sits at the top of a pyramid of suppliers, thousands of them. They range from major multinationals, such as Bosch, down to small firms with a handful of employees, and they include companies which are heavily reliant on a single customer: JLR. For many of those firms, the shutdown represented a very real threat to their business. In a letter to the Chancellor on 25 September, the Business and Trade Committee warned that smaller firms ""may have at best a week of cashflow left to support themselves"", while larger companies ""may begin to seriously struggle within a fortnight"". Industry analysts expressed concerns that if companies started to go bankrupt, a trickle could soon become a flood – potentially causing permanent damage to the country's advanced engineering industry. Resuming production does not automatically mean the crisis is over either. ""It has come too late,"" explains David Roberts, who is the Chairman of Coventry-based Evtec, a direct supplier to JLR, with some 1,250 employees. ""All of our companies have had six weeks of zero sales, but all the costs. The sector still desperately needs cash."" From Co-op to Marks & Spencer A recent IBM report, which looked at data breaches experienced by about 600 organisations worldwide found that the average cost was $4.4m (or £3.3m). But JLR is far from an outlier when it comes to high-profile cyber attacks on an even greater scale. Marks & Spencer and the Co-op supermarket chain this year are estimated to have cost £300 million and £120 million respectively. Over the Easter weekend in April, attackers managed to gain entry to Marks & Spencer's IT systems via a third-party contractor, forcing it to take some networks offline. Initially, the disruption seemed relatively minor – with contactless payment systems out of action, and customers unable to use its 'click and collect' service. However, within days, it had halted all online shopping – which normally makes up around a third of its business. It was described at the time as ""almost like cutting off one of your limbs"", by Nayna McIntosh, former executive committee member of M&S and the founder of Hope Fashion. Bloomberg via Getty Images Attackers managed to gain entry to Marks & Spencer's IT systems via a third-party contractor When the Co-op supermarket chain was hit, the same group of hackers claimed responsibility. It was, they suggested, an attempt to extort a ransom from the company by infecting its networks with malicious software. However the IT networks were shut down quickly enough to avoid significant damage. As the criminals angrily described it to the BBC, ""they yanked their own plug - tanking sales, burning logistics, and torching shareholder value"". According to Jamie MacColl, a cyber expert at the security research group, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), it is no surprise to see major businesses being targeted in this way. He says it is the result of hackers being easily able to get hold of so-called ransomware (software which can lock up or encrypt a victim's computer networks until a ransom is paid). ""Historically, this kind of cyber crime… has mostly been carried out by Russian-speaking criminals, based in Russia or other parts of the former Soviet Union"", he explains. ""But there's been a bit of a change in the last couple of years where English-speaking, mostly teenage hackers have been leasing or renting ransomware from those Russian-speaking cyber criminals, and then using it to disrupt and extort from the businesses they've gained access to. ""And those English-speaking criminals do tend to focus on quite high-profile victims, because they're not just financially motivated: they want to demonstrate their skill and get kudos within this quite nasty sort of hacking ecosystem that we have."" Weak spots of big business What makes companies like Jaguar Land Rover and Marks & Spencer particularly vulnerable is the way in which their supply chains work. Carmakers have a long tradition of using so-called ""just-in-time delivery"", where parts are not held in stock but delivered from suppliers exactly where and when they are needed. This cuts down on storage and waste costs. But it also requires intricate coordination of every aspect of the supply chain, and if the computers break down, the disruption can be dramatic. Likewise, a retailer like Marks & Spencer relies on a carefully coordinated supply chain to guarantee customers the right quantities of fresh produce in the right places - which similarly proves vulnerable. Reuters If computers break down, the disruption can be dramatic for those businesses that require intricate coordination of every aspect of the supply chain ""Other industries have this model too: electronics and high-tech, because it's expensive and risky to hold inventory for a long time due to obsolescence. And then other industrial firms, such as in aerospace, for similar reasons to automotive,"" explains Elizabeth Rust, lead economist at Oxford Economics. ""So they're a bit more vulnerable to supply chain disruption from a cyber attack."" But she points out this is not the case for industries such as pharmaceuticals, where regulators require firms to hold minimum levels of stock. Rethinking lean production Andy Palmer, a former chief executive of Aston Martin who has spent decades working in the manufacturing sector, thinks the lean production models in the car and food industries need a rethink. It is a major risk, he says, when you have ""these systems where everything is tied to everything else, where the waste is taken out of every stage… but you break one link in that chain and you have no safety. ""The manufacturing sector has to have another look at the way it tackles this latest black swan"", he says, referring to an event that is unforeseen but which has significant consequences. But according to Ms Rust, businesses are unlikely to change the way their supply chains operate. ""Cyber attacks are really expensive… but shifting away from just-in-time management is potentially even more expensive. This is hundreds of millions, possibly, that a firm would have to incur annually"". She believes the costs would also make it a steep challenge for regulators to demand such changes. 'The cumulative effect of inaction' In late September a ransomware attack on American aviation technology firm Collins Aerospace caused serious problems at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow, after it disabled check-in and baggage handling systems. The problem was resolved relatively quickly, but not before a large number of flights had been cancelled. Industry sources warn that Europe's airspace and key airports are so heavily congested that disruption in one area can quickly spread to others – and the costs can quickly add up. In this instance, the knock-on effects were largely confined to widespread delays and flight cancellations. But it nods to a bigger question of what happens if a hack on critical infrastructure paralyses financial, transport or energy networks, potentially leading to huge economic costs - or worse? AFP via Getty Images A ransomware attack caused serious problems at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow last year ""I think the worst-case scenario is probably something affecting financial services or energy provision, because of the potential cascading effects of either of those two"", says RUSI analyst Jamie MacColl. ""The good news is the financial sector is by far the most heavily-regulated sector in the UK for cyber security. And I think it's quite telling, there's rarely been a very impactful cyber attack on a Western bank."" The outlook, were there an attack on the energy sector, is not clear. A 2015 study by Lloyds Bank, entitled ""Business Blackout"", modelled the impact of a hypothetical attack on the US power grid, concluding that economic losses could exceed $1 trillion (£742bn). However Mr MacColl believes that in the UK, there is probably enough spare capacity in the grid to deal with a cyber incident. More concerningly, Mr MacColl thinks the UK has had ""quite a laissez-faire approach to cyber security over the past 15 years"", with the issue given little priority by successive governments. He believes that this year's major attacks may be the ""cumulative effect of a kind of inaction on cyber security, both from the government and from businesses, and it's sort of really starting to bite now"". That inaction, he says, needs to change, with both regulators and large businesses taking more responsibility. Anadolu via Getty Images Some check-in and baggage handling systems were disabled as a result of the attack that affected several European airports In July last year the government did announce plans to introduce a Cyber Security and Resilience bill but its passage to becoming law has been repeatedly delayed. In May, GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre published a report warning about the growing impact of cyber threats from hackers using artificial intelligence-based tools. It suggested that over the next two years, ""a growing divide will emerge between organisations that can keep pace with AI-enabled threats, and those that fall behind – exposing them to greater risk, and intensifying the overall threat to the UK's digital infrastructure. However, what worries Jamie MacColl most are the sorts of attacks we haven't yet thought to protect against. ""I would be more concerned about the sort of company that is the only business that provides a particular service, but that we don't really know about, and that isn't regulated as critical national infrastructure"", he says. An attack on one of these less glamourous economic pivots, he argues, could have huge ramifications through the wider economy. ""That's the sort of thing that would keep me up at night,"" he says. ""The single point of failure that we are not aware of yet.""

38715f0750d0,How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance,,"How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance Osmond Chia Business reporter Getty Images Jensen Huang, the boss of Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, has warned China is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US in chips The US has dominated the global technology market for decades. But China wants to change that. The world's second largest economy is pouring huge amounts of money into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Crucially, Beijing is also investing heavily to  produce the high-end chips that power these cutting-edge technologies. Last month, Jensen Huang - the boss of Silicon Valley-based AI chip giant Nvidia - warned that China was just ""nanoseconds behind"" the US in chip development. So can Beijing match American technology and break its reliance on imported high-end chips? After DeepSeek China's DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech world in 2024 when it launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT . The announcement by a relatively unknown startup was impressive for a number of reasons, not least because the company said it cost much less to train than leading AI models. It was said to have been created using far fewer high-end chips than its rivals , and its launch temporarily sank Silicon Valley-based Nvidia's market value. And momentum in China's tech sector has continued. This year, some of the country's big tech firms have made it clear that they aim to take on Nvidia and become the main advanced chip suppliers for local companies. In September, Chinese state media said a new chip announced by Alibaba can match the performance of Nvidia's H20 semiconductors while using less energy. H20s are scaled-down processors made for the Chinese market under US export rules. Huawei also unveiled what it said were its most powerful chips ever, along with a three-year plan to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market. The Chinese tech giant also said it would make its designs and computer programs available to the public in China in an effort to draw firms away from their reliance on US products. Getty Images DeepSeek stunned the tech world in 2024 when it launched an AI model to rival ChatGPT Other Chinese chip developers have also secured major contracts with big businesses in the country. MetaX is supplying advanced chips for the likes of state-owned telecoms operator, China Unicom. Another hotly-tipped potential challenger to Nvidia is Beijing-based Cambricon Technologies. Its Shanghai-listed shares have more than doubled in value over the last three months as investors bet that it will benefit from Beijing's push for Chinese firms to use locally produced high-end chips. Tencent, which owns the super app WeChat, is another notable tech giant that has heeded the government’s call to use Chinese chips. There has also been no shortage of state-backed trade shows, promoting Chinese technology companies in a bid to attract investors. ""The competition has undeniably arrived,"" a spokesperson for Nvidia told the BBC in response to queries about the recent progress made by Chinese chip firms. ""Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We'll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere."" Yet some experts have cautioned that claims made by Chinese chipmakers should be taken with a pinch of salt due to a lack of publicly available data and consistent testing benchmarks. China's semiconductors perform similarly to the US in predictive AI but fall short in complex analytics, said computer scientist Jawad Haj-Yahya, who has tested both American and Chinese chips. ""The gap is clear and it is surely shrinking. But I don't think it's something they will catch up on in the short-term."" Where China leads - and lags On the BG2 technology and business podcast in September, Nvidia's Jensen Huang highlighted the strengths of China's tech sector, crediting its hardworking and vast talent pool, intense domestic competition and progress in chipmaking. ""This is a vibrant entrepreneurial, high-tech, modern industry,"" he said, urging the US to compete ""for its survival"". His assessment is likely to be welcomed by officials in Beijing. The country has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West. For years, China has invested heavily in what President Xi Jinping calls ""high-quality development"", which covers industries from renewables to AI. Even before US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, China had spent tens of billions of dollars as part of its efforts to transform its vast economy from the ""world's factory"" for basic products to a home of cutting-edge industries. An ongoing tariffs war with Trump's America has only made that mission more urgent. Xi has vowed to make his country more self-reliant and not depend on ""anyone's gifts"". Mr Huang has also warned that the US should trade freely with China or risk handing it the edge in the AI race. This comes against a backdrop of Beijing applying more pressure on Nvidia as it launched an anti-monopoly probe into the firm last month. But China's state-led approach can also be an obstacle to innovation if everyone in the sector only focuses on a ""shared goal"", said computing professor Chia-Lin Yang from the National Taiwan University. It can make it harder for disruptive ideas to break the mould, she added. China's chip industry has also yet to overcome criticism that its products can be less user-friendly than those of Western rivals like Nvidia. Prof Yang believes these issues can soon be solved by China's huge number of skilled tech industry workers. ""You cannot underestimate China's ability to catch up."" Getty Images Chinese tech giant Huawei unveiled its plans to rival Nvidia's dominance in AI chips 'Bargaining chip' for China She described China's recent announcements about the chip sector as a ""bargaining chip"" in its months-long tariffs negotiations with the US. Beijing aims to pressure Washington into selling its advanced equipment or risk losing its position in such a large market, said Dr Jawad. These announcements project strength on China's part, even though it is likely to still want to buy American technology, he added. Most experts agree that China is still reliant on the US for the most powerful chips, at least for now. Beijing needs access to some high-end American technology for its more advanced projects and to ensure it isn't left behind, said semiconductor engineer Raghavendra Anjanappa. Realistically, China can reduce its dependence on American chips in less-advanced tools, but doesn't have the ""raw performance"" of US chips to train more complex AI systems, said Mr Raghavendra. Despite a number of breakthroughs China still lacks the highly developed supply chains that have been long established in the US, South Korea and Taiwan. The US has also deployed export restrictions as it tries to slow down China's development of advanced technology, including Washington's decision to block Beijing's access to high-end Nvidia chips . The US has ""hit China exactly where its dependency is deepest,"" said Mr Raghavendra. ""But China's not far off in the grand scheme and they might only need five more years to be independent from the US.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9949/live/85746ea0-9cd6-11f0-8245-f3f629744491.jpg,2025-10-05T23:00:21.882000+00:00,1f133e37999005a65c04b512a274d6d8c2bfbef8
afdb256e21a3,How to get AI to work in 22 languages,,"How to get AI to work in 22 languages Priti Gupta Technology Reporter, Mumbai Priti Gupta Translation tech has made work easier for Vineet Sawant Vineet Sawant has spent the last two years navigating the streets of Mumbai on a scooter as a delivery driver. ""Being on the road is always very stressful and especially in cities like Mumbai,"" he says. But when he started out language barriers were an additional problem. His first language is Marathi and Mr Sawant speaks ""very little"" English. ""I can understand but it's very difficult to read,"" he explains. That caused problems at his new job. He said: ""At first, it was difficult. Everything was in English, and I can understand some of it, but I'm more comfortable in Marathi. I used to ask other delivery guys to help me figure out what to do."" His employer, Zepto, promises ""India's Fastest Online Grocery Delivery"". So having drivers struggling with delivery instructions was not ideal. To smooth this process a year ago, Zepto partnered with Reverie Language Technologies to introduce an AI translation service for its drivers. Since then its delivery drivers have been able to choose between six languages on the Zepto app. ""I don't have to guess anymore,"" says Mr Sawant. ""Earlier I would take more time to read and sometimes even made mistakes. Now if the customer writes 'ring bell', I get that instruction in Marathi. So, I don't have to ask or check again. It's all clear."" Getty Images India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects Mr Sawant's difficulties are common. ""India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects,"" says Professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya, from IIT Mumbai, one of India's leading experts in the use of AI in Indian languages. ""Without tech, that understands and speaks these languages, millions are excluded from the digital revolution - especially in education, governance, healthcare, and banking,"" he points out. The rollout of new generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, has made the task more urgent. Vast amounts of data, like web pages, books or video transcripts are used to train an AI. In widely spoken languages like Hindi and English that is relatively easy to get, but for others it is more difficult. ""The main challenge to create Indian language models is the availability of data. I'm talking about refined data. Coarse quality data, is available. But that data is not of very high quality, it needs filtering,"" says Professor Bhattacharyya. ""The issue in India is for many Indian languages, especially tribal and regional dialects, this data simply doesn't exist or is not digitised."" Reverie Language Technologies is now deploying its AI-driven translation technology for a range of Indian companies. Co-founder Vivekananda Pani says that while translation technology will make communication easier, there is ""potential for less common dialects to be pushed aside"". ""The challenge will be to make sure that the amazing benefits of AI-driven language advancements don't accidentally shrink the rich variety of human language."" To help tackle the problem Professor Bhattacharyya has contributed to Bhashini , a government project to develop those high quality datasets needed to train an AI. As well as the datasets, Bhashini has built AI language models and translation services in 22 languages. Started in 2022, it's a huge undertaking, but has already made a lot of progress. Bhashini currently hosts 350 AI-based language models that have processed more than a billion tasks. More than 50 government departments work with Bhashini, as well as 25 state governments. For example Bhashini tech is used in multi-lingual chatbots for public services and to translate government schemes into local languages. ""Bhashini ensures India's linguistic and cultural representation by building India-specific AI models rather than relying on global platforms,"" says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Digital India, Bhashini Division. He hopes that within the next two or three years rural users will have voice-enabled access to government services, financial tools and information systems in their native languages. Getty Images Indian researches are developing an AI to help smokers quit These India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population. Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging. Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking. He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. The AI ""will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,"" says Professor Jadhav. And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi. ""It will be very customized, it will not be something just off the shelf,"" he says. Back on the streets of the city, Vineet Sawant has increased the number of parcels he delivers from ten to around 30 a day, helped in part by the translation function in the delivery app. He thinks it will help more people like him. ""It makes us feel like we belong. Not everyone understands English. When the app speaks our language, we feel more confident, and we work better.""

8bef639bf36c,Could aluminium become the packaging 'champion'?,,"Could aluminium become the packaging 'champion'? MaryLou Costa Technology Reporter Meadow Some packaging firms are betting on aluminium In front of me is a line-up of aluminium cans, but not a drink in sight. Instead, these cans have been designed to hold toiletries like shampoo, shower gel and hand wash, condiments like ketchup and household cleaning products. I'm at the London research and development centre for Meadow, a start-up that has developed a new packaging system. Their idea is to move products currently packaged in plastic to aluminium cans. The founders believe it could be the next big step in reducing the amount of plastic packaging in the world, thanks to the high recycling rate of aluminium cans compared to plastic - 81% vs 52%, according to figures from the National Packaging Waste Database. Meadow has taken the typical aluminium drink can and tweaked it, so that it will slot into a cannister, which can be equipped with all sorts of dispensing options. So depending on the contents, you could have a pump, a squeeze top, spray nozzle, screw top lid or other options. The can itself has a sealed top and crinkles at the edges to make it clear the contents aren't to be drunk. When the can is empty, it can be taken out for recycling, and replaced with a new one. Aluminium can manufacturer Ball, which already offers recyclable aluminium packaging for shampoos and lotions, has invested in Meadow and will offer the system to the big personal care brands it works with. ""We realised the greenest container already exists - the aluminium can. So we thought, what do we need to do, to take it to new industries?"" says Victor Ljungberg, Meadow's co-founder and chief executive, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden. Meadow Meadow hopes its dispenser will attract new product lines to aluminium packaging Aluminium has strong recyclability credentials; it is considered to be infinitely recyclable, compared with plastic, which loses its quality after being recycled several times. It is also lighter than glass, so the energy needed to transport aluminium cans is significantly less than glass bottles. The wine industry has already trialled full size aluminium bottles, with organic brand Vinca rolling them out in March through Tesco. Aldi this year also launched an own-label wine in an aluminium bottle. More industries are set to make the jump, as new EU packaging and waste regulations come into effect in January 2030, stating that all packaging should be at least 70% recyclable. By 2038, the minimum level of recyclability for packaging will jump to 80%. Getty Images Producing aluminium is energy intensive So what might hold back aluminium? Producing new aluminium is energy intensive. It requires almost twice as much energy to produce as glass. Calculating the environmental impact of aluminium versus glass is complicated and often the best choice depends on what is being shipped. Price is definitely a factor, according to Mark Lansley, the owner and chief executive of Broadland Drinks, which supplied the aluminium-bottled wine to Aldi, and has another similar launch planned this year. Aluminium, explains Mr Lansley, is a third lighter than glass, saving about 900 grams of CO2 emissions - but is four times more expensive. He admits to absorbing the extra cost alongside Aldi in the name of innovation, but says that aluminium becoming more widely adopted relies on its cost coming down. ""We've got to get over this cost. We've got to sell the benefits and better spell out the lower carbon footprint that aluminium has,"" says Mr Lansley. Consumers will also need to adapt to different looking packaging. Mr Lansley says the wine industry already tackled this challenge when it introduced screw tops, but when it comes to packaging, there are just some situations where only a glass wine bottle will do. ""Aluminium bottles are lighter and don't shatter, so they are much better for a picnic, or by the pool. But then you've got tradition, and what folks are used to. ""You might be opening a bottle of wine to celebrate with friends, or as a reward and relaxation. A glass bottle of wine is embedded in that culture,"" says Mr Lansley. Vinca Some winemakers are experimenting with aluminium bottles A lot of what consumers associate with their favourite brands has been intentionally driven by those brands, and changing that could take a lot of convincing too, notes Jamie Stone, packaging expert at global innovation consultancy PA Consulting. ""Big brands have spent decades and invested billions in educating customers on distinctive packaging - think of the iconic Heinz ketchup bottle, a bottle of Flash spray, or Kikkoman soy sauce,"" Mr Stone, who is London-based, points out. ""Aluminium can't easily make shaped packs. That's a challenge when shape forms a key part of brand identity and consumer recognition. Think how many everyday products - like sauces, shampoo, washing up liquid, or moisturisers - rely on squeezable packaging. Aluminium, being rigid, removes that functionality."" He adds: ""In many categories, consumers want to see the product they're buying, whether it's the colour of a juice, the consistency of a lotion, or the thickness of a sauce. Aluminium's opacity removes that visual connection."" Mark Armstrong is a design director at creative agency Marks, which has designed packaging for Starbucks. He says one reason we haven't seen aluminium packaging become the norm, is that manufacturers have long-established plastic packaging lines. These would require significant modification or replacement to handle aluminium, at a high cost. And, most food-grade aluminium needs internal lacquer or polymer coatings, which must also meet recyclability guidelines, Mr Armstrong adds. ""Aluminium is arguably the champion of recyclable materials. But the options for dispensing and reseal-ability often rely on a secondary plastic material. This then compromises the recyclability for consumers if it requires them to separate out materials to be recycled, which greatly weakens the appeal,"" says Mr Armstrong. Innovations in plastic's sustainability also can't be ignored, from the development of ones that can be infinitely recycled, to those that are biodegradable. For that reason, Jayne Paramor, sustainable packaging lead at sustainability consultancy Anthesis, argues that plastic may still end up as brands' packaging of choice. ""Plastics remain highly suited to many packaging applications due to their durability, inertness and design flexibility,"" says Ms Paramor.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3nw5vnzgpo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/56fa/live/a9bf34c0-55b4-11f0-adae-51d36c615fe4.jpg,2025-07-28T23:04:41.067000+00:00,435fb67c9815d9ef50dfce6d5266faea50e9d1b4
e0314154097e,"Artificial food colours are out, so what's next?",,"Artificial food colours are out, so what's next? Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Fermentalg There are hundreds of thousands of microalgae species French firm Fermentalg has been all over the planet in its search for useful microalgae. ""One of our lucky scientists got to go and climb the volcanoes in the Caribbean for example, and I have to restrain myself from collecting more every time I go home to New Zealand,"" says Hywel Griffiths, chief scientific officer at Fermentalg. There are hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae - microscopic organisms, which mostly live in water. They are essential to the aquatic food chain and also produce half the oxygen we breathe. Some are already used commercially, to make food, animal feed and fertiliser . But for Fermantalg one particular type, Galdieria sulphuraria, has a very useful trait. It can be used to produce a pigment, suitable for use in food, called Galdieria blue. ""We grow the algae and make a lot of it under conditions which make a lot of this particular molecule - the blue,"" says Mr Griffiths. The pigment can be used for any food and drinks and Mr Griffiths expects the first products using Galdieiria blue will be on shop shelves early next year. Galdieria blue was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May, along with Butterfly pea flower extract (also a blue colour) and calcium phosphate (white). The FDA also approved Gardenia blue earlier this month. Fermentalg Fermentalg grows a microalgae that produces a blue molecule New sources of colour for food are needed as artificial food dyes are on their way out. In January, the FDA announced the banning of Red Dye No. 3 in food products. In addition, the FDA is looking to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes such as Yellow Dye 5 and 6 by the end of next year as part of the government's mission to ""Make America Healthy Again"". ""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,"" FDA commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference in April. Though not an outright ban, the FDA is hoping the food industry voluntarily complies to eliminate artificial food dyes by 2026. It comes after years of pressure from parents and campaigners for the FDA to revoke approval for dyes or educate consumers more about the risks. In recent times, many US states have made their own moves to pass laws to remove artificial food colouring dyes. Countries differ on the restrictions they have in place. Historically, the UK and the European Union have been stricter than the US. The EU has been phasing out artificial colourings over the last 20 years and also introducing warnings on foods with other colours. Sensient Sensient processes natural products and extracts the colours So, these are good times for firms developing natural alternatives. US-based Sensient creates natural colours by sourcing raw materials that are grown specifically for their colour content. For example, some red and purple colours are derived from carrots and potatoes. ""These crops are harvested, washed, processed into a juice, and the colour is extracted with water or other solvents,"" says Paul Manning, chief executive officer at Sensient. ""The resulting colour is further processed to stabilise the concentrate and refine it to the specific shade desired by the customer."" But the hard work will be trying to match the synthetic colour. ""It must be equally vivid,"" says Mr Manning. ""There are plenty of examples of brands converting to natural colours with less vivid and vibrant shades where the product does poorly in the market and customers complain about both the colour and the flavour."" Getting a stable, bright colour also involved much work for Fermantalg. ""To our surprise we found that the process of growing the algae and the process of extracting the colour can actually have a fairly significant impact on the stability of the product at the end, even though it's fairly heavily purified,"" says Griffiths. ""But something that we've done upstream is having an impact on how stable it is at the end."" Will these new colours cost more? ""They are more expensive, but in actual contribution to the end product, they're not actually that big an impact because these things are used at a fraction of a percentage in the final product,"" says Mr Griffiths. ""If you had a nosebleed and stood over the sink… you know that a little bit of colour goes a long way."" Sensient There's a rush to produce alternative food colours For the brands that have long relied on artificial colourings, it's an upheaval. ""We are reformulating our cereals served in schools to not include FD&C colours by the 2026-27 school year,"" says a spokesperson for WK Kellogg, the company behind Kellogg's. FD&C refers to certain certified synthetic colour additives regulated by the FDA, and approved by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Last year protesters gathered outside the company headquarters in Michigan,  calling on it to remove artificial dyes from cereals such as Froot Loops. ""We will not be launching any new products with FD&C colours, beginning in January 2026,"" the spokesperson said. This year food giants including Nestle, Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Conagra have all pledged to phase out artificial food colourings . One of the challenges for food brands reliant on artificial colouring is that many natural food dyes don't necessarily have a long shelf life, says Institute of Food Technologists food scientist Renee Leber. ""Whereas synthetic dyes will outlive the shelf life of pretty much any product."" She also says that as many brands rush to make the switch it's going to lead to a ""bottleneck"" in production. ""We don't necessarily have all these colours available. But we have 10 months to get that right."" Given this isn't an outright ban, is it still expected to lead to sweeping change in the US food industry? ""If you are a cereal company and you have a brightly coloured cereal and all of your competitors switch from synthetics to natural colours, then you don't necessarily want to be the last one,"" says Ms Leber. ""It's a tight timeframe but companies are doing their best to comply.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g83dpeendo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0155/live/0f9c05d0-6932-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg,2025-07-24T23:01:09.989000+00:00,8c4ba16477e3cc1f5673ffa276b1ac032749cdf0
42ce42dea81c,Trucking's uneasy relationship with new tech,,"Trucking's uneasy relationship with new tech Sam Gruet Technology Reporter, Vancouver Getty Images Digital trucking apps look to minimise trucks without cargo When Jared first started out in trucking more than two decades ago, he didn't anticipate he'd be on tour with a country music star, hauling guitars, amps, and other pieces of on-stage equipment. ""It just happened, right place, right time,"" the Canadian driver, who prefers not to use his surname, explains from behind the wheel of his towering lorry. ""I've done 5,000 miles in a month and a half, but there's a lot of breaks this year."" But during time off between driving to shows in New Jersey, New York, Toronto and Nashville, Jared will be scanning multiple screens in his cabin – a laptop, tablet and two smart phones – to secure more work. All made possible by new technology. It's a world away from his early career, when he was transporting fruit and wine, he explains. ""Back in the day, you had to sit by a payphone if you're on the road and start calling people you've worked with and then you'd have a pager. ""Today, you just turn on your devices and scan through possible work. It's all digital and you get paid instantly. It's much better for business."" The change has been driven by ""Uberised"" platforms, digitally matching truckers with companies which need to move freight. The phrase was coined due to the similarity to the ride hailing app. While Jared agrees it has made things easier, the truck driver says it has led to wages falling. ""During Covid, the average was $3 (£2.24) per mile, today on some loads from Toronto to Los Angeles that is $1.10 per mile."" Not to mention, he says, the rising cost of fuel. In Canada, eight major platforms including Uber Freight, have emerged to digitise the market for freight. Like the taxi app, they are capitalising on a fragmented market dominated by smaller players, with 2023 data suggesting that more than eight in 10 trucking and freight firms in Canada employ fewer than five people. Christopher Monette, from Teamsters Canada, told the BBC that the Canadian Trade Union representing over 130,000 members including truckers, has ""deep concerns around the efforts to 'Uberise' the trucking sector"". ""Wages in Canada have remained largely stagnant for the past 25 years, and the rise of gig-style work stands to make things even worse,"" he argues, adding that ""larger, often unionised carriers who operate responsibly by investing in safety, training, and decent working conditions are most at risk"". ""Truckers don't need another app. We need stronger protections and bigger paycheques."" When asked, Uber Freight did not directly address the issue of wages and prices. Instead, a spokesperson said: ""Flexibility, transparency, and choice are built directly into our platform. ""Carriers can search for loads based on their preferences, such as lane, equipment type, commodity, and schedule, and either book instantly at a listed price or submit a bid for a rate that better aligns with their needs. In the trucking industry a lane refers to a regularly travelled route. ""Our platform also uses real-time market data and AI-powered recommendations to help carriers make the most of their time on the road,"" the spokesperson said. Eric Beckwitt's firm is using AI to speed up complicated bookings Vancouver-based Freightera is among the biggest players when it comes to digital trucking services in Canada. Co-founder Eric Beckwitt meets me at a point overlooking the city's sprawling port, where towering orange cranes move brightly coloured containers against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains. When he started the company in 2014, there were no trucking apps for Canadian companies. The service he has developed allows drivers and customers to search 20 billion regular routes for hauling freight which, he says, can be done in ""five or 10 seconds"". He points out that, unlike other platforms, Freightera does not set prices. ""At Freightera, carriers set their own price. We ask them what they need to be healthy and profitable on each lane, and they set the price."" Mr Beckwitt says the service has been good for trucking. Before services like his came along, finding work, or even the best route, was like ""finding a needle in a haystack"", the Freightera boss explains. ""Carriers really appreciate Freightera's reliable demand for service, which has grown every year consistently, right through Covid, the inflation afterwards and the current freight recession, one of the largest running freight downtowns,"" he says. The company is now developing AI to speed up complicated bookings: ""Digging through the noisy, messy documents, fine print and inconsistent rules - things like missing paperwork, unexpected charges, or a routing issue that could throw off delivery."" Mr Beckwitt also dreams of a completely automated freight industry, ""40 years from now"", where AI would control global freight. ""Automatically assigning cargo to networks with the lowest capacity and allowing complete transparency, tracking and even trading while they're in travel"". Getty Images Around three quarters of Kenyan freight is moved by trucks Digital trucking services are employed all over the world. Kenya heavily relies on road freight, so has embraced the new tech. ""Over 75% of inland freight is moved by road and in many cases it's the only mode of transportation available,"" says Jean-Claude Homawoo, co-founder of Africa's biggest digitised freight platform, LORI. Since launching in 2016, LORI has grown its network to 20,000 trucks. It doesn't own any vehicles but manages them digitally, trying to ensure that trucks don't stand idle or return home empty. In that time, he says, ""there are certain routes like Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda, where we have loaded so many trucks that the price of a full truckload has fallen"". If truckers are finding work that requires less driving around without cargo, then they should be using less fuel. And that could be helpful in cutting the industry's contribution to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Trucking accounts for more than half of CO2 emissions within trade-related transport, according to a 2022 McKinsey report . Mr Beckwitt is convinced that tech like his, is the answer. ""It's just so much more energy-efficient and so much more cost-efficient,"" he adds. Getty Images Driverless trucks are being trialled across China One form of AI might be helping drivers find work, but another could, one day, put them out of work. In April, a commercial driverless truck took to an American highway for the first time ever, operated by US-based tech firm Aurora. In China, fleets of driverless lorries are currently operating on test routes around the country. ""The technology is there,"" explains Freightera's Mr Beckwitt. ""It's just whether we trust it to be let loose on the roads. And there's obviously bureaucratic hurdles in the way and red tape."" For trucker Jared though, self-driving freight is still a distant prospect. ""Transportation has been around for hundreds of years. It's not going to end with people worrying about self-driving trucks, that's not going to happen any time soon.""

33ce7ee44bc4,The indigenous weavers who aim for empowerment over exploitation,,"The indigenous weavers who aim for empowerment over exploitation Catherine Ellis Business reporter, Riohacha, Colombia BBC In the Colombian city of Riohacha there are numerous street sellers of traditional bags called mochilas For every handwoven bag she sells on the palm-lined promenade of Riohacha, a city on Colombia's Caribbean coast, Sandra Aguilar feels that she's sharing a piece of her heritage. Once used exclusively by the Wayuu, the largest indigenous group in the South American country, the bags - known as mochilas - are now a staple across Colombia, and popular with foreign tourists. But these days the bags are also increasingly sold in global boutiques, featured at fashion events around the world, and listed on platforms like Etsy, Amazon, and Instagram - reaching buyers who may never have set foot in Colombia. ""Thanks to online posts, international visitors are becoming very knowledgeable about the mochila,"" Ms Aguilar says. ""They recognise and appreciate its ancestral value."" Weaving has long been central to the Wayuu people, who number around 380,000 in Colombia. They have lived for centuries on the semi-arid peninsula of La Guajira in the northeast of the country, and extend into neighbouring Venezuela. Techniques are passed down through generations, with geometric patterns on many mochilas reflecting clan identity, spirituality, and the natural world. Weaving is also a vital source of income in La Guajira, Colombia's second-poorest province, where two-thirds of the population live in poverty. For Ms Aguilar, both domestic mochila sales and exports have improved conditions in her rural Wayuu community of 11 families, and enabled her daughter and niece to attend university. But while the growing global demand has improved opportunities for some, it has also brought challenges. Many artisans face exploitation, and there are concerns that traditional craftsmanship is being sacrificed for speed and commercial gain. Some Wayuu women - supported by socially-conscious entrepreneurs - are working to access fairer export markets and promote the mochila's cultural value. Prices for Wayuu mochilas vary considerably. A medium-sized lower quality bag - made with simpler designs and weaving techniques - can be found across Colombia for around $20 (£15) - sometimes less. Higher-end bags typically start at around $80 and can rise to several hundred pounds, depending on the weaving time, complexity of the design. Traditionally, mochilas were crafted over weeks, but rising demand led many weavers to develop faster techniques, producing simpler designs in two or three days. Sandra Aguilar sells mochilas made by women in her extended Wayuu family For Colombian entrepreneur Laura Chica, compliments on the Wayuu bag she was using during a trip to Europe sparked a business idea. She founded mochila company Chila Bags back in 2013. ""Instagram was just starting, and the brand began to take off,"" she says. Ms Chica says she focuses on high-quality bags incorporating traditional patterns and elements. The bags reflect the artisans' skills, time, and heritage, for which they receive a fair wage, she says. Her brand has been featured in magazines, such as Vogue China, and showcased at international fashion weeks and high-end retail spaces from Hawaii to London, Paris and Shanghai. But does she think the flourishing popularity of mochilas has been beneficial for the Wayuu? For Ms Chica, that very much depends on which market you look at. She says two have developed. ""There are brands, and those interested in the story behind how the bag is made, that want to keep sharing it with the world,"" she says. She adds that these provide a market for customers who value indigenous arts, sustainability and fair trade, and are willing to pay more. But not all weavers have been able to access ways to work with such companies that pay decent prices, says Ms Chica. Instead she says that that many have to rely on a parallel market where quick production, sales and profits are prioritised, which undermines pay and the quality of the work. In Riohacha's Mercado Nuevo - a maze-like market bursting with colourful stalls selling yarn, chinchorros (traditional Wayuu hammocks) and mochilas - a group of women crouches on the concrete floor, weaving. They explain that intermediaries, or middlemen, may offer them as little as $5.50 per bag, but after paying for thread and transport, they often earn as little as $1.50 - excluding the time spent weaving. Many such Wayuu weavers come from rural, isolated communities where only Wayuunaiki - the Wayuu language - is spoken. This makes it difficult for them to access a broader customer base and navigate economic opportunities. As a result, they sell to the middlemen. ""Some Wayuu women are being forced to accept whatever price, benefiting everyone except the women themselves,"" says Paula Restrepo, director of Fundación Talento Colectivo. Her organisation supports female weavers, whom she and many others recognise as skilled artisans, through education and training. She is keen to stress that not all intermediaries are harmful. Instead, she says that the reputable ones, which she calls ""solidarity intermediaries"" help establish an equitable system for purchasing mochilas, ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions through fair trade principles. Her foundation has partnered with mochila brand and non-profit organisation One Thread Collective to provide the weavers with leadership workshops. ""The idea is that the artisans prepare themselves to be autonomous, to be entrepreneurs, to be capable in the future of being in contact with other clients,"" says Ms Restrepo. The weavers in Riohacha's Mercado Nuevo work on the concrete floor One of the weavers who has taken part in the workshops is Yamile Vangrieken.  Sitting on a bright orange chinchorro at her home on the outskirts of Riohacha, she explains she leads a group of eight relatives from the rural community where her family is from. She acts as a bridge between them - many of whom don't speak Spanish and haven't ever been to the city - and One Thread Collective, which helps them export their bags, while providing stable income, thread and microloans. Ms Vangrieken's weaving has helped support her teenage daughter, who herself began weaving at just four-years-old. Ms Vangrieken hopes she'll finish school, go to university, and keep weaving by choice - not out of financial necessity. While mochilas are gaining international recognition, that doesn't always translate into higher sales for every business. Brandon Miller is an American entrepreneur based in Riohacha. He runs Wayuumarket.com, a platform that helps Wayuu artisans sell directly to international buyers. He says his orders have slumped, not due to a lack of interest, but because more foreign businesses are travelling to La Guajira to source the bags directly, communicating through AI tools like ChatGPT and translation apps. Yamile Vangrieken earns enough money to support her daugther But buying online has changed too. Mr Miller says influencers - especially from China and Thailand - started streaming live from La Guajira on platforms like TikTok, offering real-time purchases to their followers. Shifts in demand, and how mochilas are sold, have raised concerns about control over the bags' design, narrative, and profits. Back on Riohacha's promenade, Ms Aguilar says the bag's fashion rise has led artisans to adapt or add elements, such as elaborate beading, religious icons, or even football club logos. She worries that these sales strategies are eroding cultural norms. But she remains positive. Recognition is increasing - not only of the Wayuu bags - but of the indigenous group and the weavers themselves. ""We are also artists, even if we don't have a title that says so,"" she says. ""Our essence is in our designs, in our products and we mustn't let that go. When we lose our customs and traditions, we are left with nothing.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62lnkvmn12o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/900a/live/f9622fd0-9300-11f0-a647-dff301f4a439.jpg,2025-10-05T23:19:10.051000+00:00,e43085227f7ef1e18bea89b52817438f1ebe123e

The consumer group is taking the tech giant to the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London on Monday. The trial between Which? and Qualcomm is expected to last five weeks. The consumer group is accusing the chip company of anti-competitive practices. It claims the firm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential handset components, which then pushed up the cost of those smartphones for consumers. The BBC has reached out to Qualcomm for comment. The trial starting on Monday will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused a dominant position. If Which? is successful, there will be a second stage seeking £480m from Qualcomm, to be distributed among an estimated 29 million British phone owners affected. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased between 1 October 2015 and 9 January 2024. The consumer group says this would probably work out at around £17 each. Qualcomm has previously said the case has ""no basis"". A similar case against Qualcomm is ongoing in Canada, and the firm has also previously been fined by the EU for antitrust. Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which?, said: ""This trial is a huge moment. It shows how the power of consumers - backed by Which? - can be used to hold the biggest companies to account if they abuse their dominant position.""

3e586b23f634,Housebuying reform plan aims to cut costs and time,,"Plans for a major reform of the housebuying system, which aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales, have been unveiled by the government. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the changes would ""fix the broken system"" and put more money ""back into working people's pockets"". Under the new proposals, sellers and estate agents will be legally required to provide key information about a property up front. The overhaul could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and cut up to four weeks off the typical property transaction timeline, according to the government. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms. Those in the middle of a chain could also potentially gain a net saving of £400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. The consultation draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. This will include being up front about the condition of the home, any leasehold costs, and details of property chains. The government says this transparency will reduce the risk of deals collapsing late in the process and improve confidence among buyers, particularly those purchasing a home for the first time. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, a move intended to halve the number of failed transactions, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5bn a year. ""Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare,"" said Reed. ""Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives."" The reforms will also aim to boost professional standards across the housing sector. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed, along with the introduction of side-by-side performance data to help buyers choose trusted professionals based on expertise and track record. The government says a full roadmap for the changes will be published in the new year, forming part of its broader housing strategy, which includes a pledge to build 1.5 million new homes. Rightmove chief executive Johan Svanstrom said: ""We welcome the announcement today aiming to drive forward that much needed change and modernisation. ""The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals."" Paul Whitehead chief executive at Zoopla said: ""We look forward to working closely with government and the wider industry to modernise the homebuying process, so that buyers are given certainty earlier and to help reduce any unnecessary costs."" The announcement comes as the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester. The party will lay out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account.

52ea2b20287d,JLR to restart some production after cyber shutdown,,"JLR to restart some production after cyber shutdown Theo Leggett Business correspondent and Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images JLR's Wolverhampton plant, pictured, will be the first to go back online following the attack Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week following a major cyber-attack that forced the carmaker to shut down factories and send workers home. Manufacturing will resume first at JLR's engine factory in Wolverhampton, but it is expected to be several weeks before all operations are running at full capacity, with other sites to return gradually. Work at JLR's three UK sites in the West Midlands and Merseyside has been suspended since a cyber-attack at the end of August forced the company to shut down. The resumption of operations will be a welcome relief to JLR's array of suppliers, some of which are small businesses that have faced huge financial pressure. JLR is continuing to investigate the attack, which forced the company to shut its IT systems and send workers home. That safety measure paralysed virtually every aspect of JLR's business and meant it could not build or sell any cars, or distribute parts to service centres. As well as its UK sites in Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton, the carmaker's factories in Slovakia, China and India have also been affected by the shutdown. The hack is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility. About 30,000 people are directly employed at the company's plants with about 200,000 working for firms in the supply chain. Some of these firms supply parts exclusively to JLR, while others sell components to other carmakers as well. Evtec Group is a so-called ""tier one"" supplier which provides parts directly to JLR, while sourcing the materials it needs from other companies lower down the supply chain. It has 1,250 employees mostly based in the West Midlands, but much like JLR's factories, its main plants in Coventry and Kidderminster have been at a virtual standstill for weeks. Machines have been shut down, parts set to be shipped out piled high and most staff sent home on 80% of their usual pay. Evtec Evtec's chairman David Roberts said the impact of the shutdown has been severe Workers will return in the coming days and weeks, but Evtec's chairman David Roberts told the BBC the stoppage has had a dramatic impact on communities in the West Midlands, and uncertainty remains. ""It has had a really detrimental effect, it's devastating. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there who are now really concerned – the cost of living, Christmas coming up, when will they return to work in earnest?"" Engineer Ben Brindley said the length of the disruption has fuelled fears about his job. ""There's only so much refurbishment or decorating you can do whilst you're at home,"" he said. ""The longer it goes on for, the more worried you get really. You start to think - will I have a job to come back to?"" Experts have warned while production will gradually resume, the impact of the cyber-attack on JLR is not over. The company said its recovery programme was ""firmly under way"" and that its global parts logistics centre, which supplies spare parts to dealerships for vehicle servicing, was ""returning to full operations"". But when it comes to restarting carmaking, experts point out the process is not like flicking a switch. Some industrial processes can take days to get back up and running, while JLR has already said the restart will be done in phases. Secondly, suppliers that have lost income during the shutdown may not be able to bounce back as quickly. 'Toothless support' Andy Palmer, who has held senior roles at Nissan and was the former boss of Aston Martin, said the restart process would ""take a while"", and added the supply chain was ""broken and needs to be repaired"". ""The other issue is the impact on suppliers. Some of them... might not make it, and if any of those fail then that's more disruption in the supply chain,"" he said. While the government has agreed to back loans for JLR to support suppliers, Evtec's Mr Roberts said the policy was a ""toothless solution"". ""It doesn't help the UK's advanced manufacturing sector one iota, because we don't see any of those funds,"" he said. ""We asked the government directly, at ministerial level, to directly support the sector. They listened, but they did nothing. It's almost like they've turned a deaf ear to the needs of advanced manufacturing, which is a key platform of the Industrial Strategy"". He said the government needed to support labour and payroll costs and provide tax reliefs for a period of time while firms recover. ""Production will begin, but it's too late. All of our companies have had six weeks of zero sales and still had to pay their costs,"" Mr Roberts said. The government has said it is in ""daily contact with JLR and cyber experts to listen to concerns and what support can be provided to get production back online.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckge0ex5g27o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c916/live/235006e0-a261-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-05T23:14:18.474000+00:00,c97d9e63dba62b54e2658c28ae9f616bed715442
0774091cfd34,"Conservatives to pledge £5,000 tax rebate for young homebuyers",,"Conservatives to pledge £5,000 tax rebate for young homebuyers Georgia Roberts Political correspondent, Manchester and Kate Whannel Political reporter EPA Conservative Party Leader Kemi Badenoch spoke at the party's conference in Manchester as it began on Sunday The Conservatives will set out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. In his speech to the party's conference in Manchester, shadow chancellor Mel Stride is expected to announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account. The party says the plans will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget. Sir Mel's speech on Monday is expected to say that there is ""no more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have"". Proposals include stopping welfare claims for people with ""low-level mental health problems"" and reducing the number of civil servants by around 132,000, a reduction of around a quarter. Sir Mel will also say his party would reduce aid spending by £7 billion to 0.1% of national income. The conference in Manchester marks almost one year since Kemi Badenoch was elected party leader. In the last 12 months, the party has struggled to counter the political threat posed by Reform UK and suffered heavy defeats in this year's local elections . During their conference, which began on Sunday, the Conservatives are hoping to portray themselves as more competent and more credible - particularly on public spending - than their political rivals. It comes as the Labour government has unveiled major housing market reform plans which will aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales. Hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms, in what the government claims would be the biggest house buying shakeup in decades. In his conference speech on Monday, Sir Mel will say: ""We must get on top of government spending. ""We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. ""We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility."" His proposals include saving: £23bn from the welfare bill £8bn by bringing civil servant numbers from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000 £7bn from the overseas aid budget £3.5bn by ending the use of hotels to home asylum seekers £4bn by ensuring benefits and social housing are reserved for UK nationals £1.6bn by scrapping environmental policies, including cutting subsidies for heat pumps and electric vehicles. Earlier this year, the Labour government sought to cut nearly £5bn from the disability and health-related benefits bill but had to backtrack after a rebellion by its own MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has suggested the government will return to the issue, telling the BBC that changes to the welfare system ""must happen"". Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from £64.7bn in 2023-24 to £100.7bn in 2029-30. The Tories argue they can reduce the bill by reviewing exemptions for the Household Benefit Cap, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability - which allows claimants to lease vehicles - and changing obligations for job-seekers. It says it would stop claims for people suffering from ""low-level health"" mental health problems arguing that ""what is really needed is treatment and support, not cash"". It also says it would keep in place the two-child benefit cap, which prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The Labour government has been under pressure to remove the cap, with many of its backbenchers arguing the limit has increased the number of children in poverty. The Resolution Foundation says axing the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty and would cost around £3.5bn. Badenoch has previously defended the cap saying it was a matter of ""fairness"" and Conservatives believed people on benefits ""should have to make the same choices on having children as everyone else"". Earlier this year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to pay for an increase in defence spending. The Conservatives say further reducing spending to 0.1% would save nearly £7bn. Currently, a portion of the existing aid budget is used to pay for hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) think tank welcomed some of the proposals but warned the Conservatives not to ignore ""elephant in the room"" of age-related spending such as pensions. Tom Clougherty, IEA executive director, said: ""Ultimately, no political party is going to be able to balance the books only by cutting things their supporters don't like. ""Without that, other cuts are likely to amount to running to stand still."" The Conservatives have not committed to changing the triple lock, which guarantees that the state pension will go up each year in line with either inflation, wage increases or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. Romilly Greenhill, chief executive of Bond, the network of international development organisations, said the proposed aid budget cuts were ""reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible"". The Conservative conference comes six weeks before Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers her Budget on 26 November. During the election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. However, there has been speculation that Reeves will need to raise taxes in order to meet her self-imposed rules for public spending and debt. In a report in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor only had a ""very small margin"" - £10bn buffer - in which to operate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bbaf/live/ea22b440-a27d-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T01:11:05.703000+00:00,842e3b5a9021f161c1454bdc4feb512a9f2f113c
e7680f31c0bd,Scientists grow mini human brains to power computers,,"Scientists grow mini human brains to power computers Zoe Kleinman Technology editor BBC The building blocks for a biocomputer growing in a lab It may have its roots in science fiction, but a small number of researchers are making real progress trying to create computers out of living cells. Welcome to the weird world of biocomputing. Among those leading the way are a group of scientists in Switzerland, who I went to meet. One day, they hope we could see data centres full of ""living"" servers which replicate aspects of how artificial intelligence (AI) learns - and could use a fraction of the energy of current methods. That is the vision of Dr Fred Jordan, co-founder of the FinalSpark lab I visited. We are all used to the ideas of hardware and software in the computers we currently use. The somewhat eyebrow-raising term Dr Jordan and others in the field use to refer to what they are creating is ""wetware"". In simple terms, it involves creating neurons which are developed into clusters called organoids, which in turn can be attached to electrodes - at which point the process of trying to use them like mini-computers can begin. Dr Jordan acknowledges that, for many people, the very concept of biocomputing is probably a bit weird. ""In science fiction, people have been living with these ideas for quite a long time,"" he said. ""When you start to say, 'I'm going to use a neuron like a little machine', it's a different view of our own brain and it makes you question what we are."" For FinalSpark, the process begins with stem cells derived from human skin cells, which they buy from a clinic in Japan. The actual donors are anonymous. But, perhaps surprisingly, they're not short of offers. ""We have many people who approach us,"" he said. ""But we select only stem cells coming from official suppliers, because the quality of the cells are essential."" Scientists in Vevey, Switzerland are creating biocomputers derived from human skin cells In the lab, FinalSpark's cellular biologist Dr Flora Brozzi handed me a dish containing several small white orbs. Each little sphere is essentially a tiny, lab-grown mini-brain, made out of living stem cells which have been cultured to become clusters of neurons and supporting cells - these are the “organoids”. They are nowhere near the complexity of a human brain, but they have the same building blocks. After undergoing a process which can last several months, the organoids are ready to be attached to an electrode and then prompted to respond to simple keyboard commands. This is a means for electrical signals to be sent and received, with the results recorded on a normal computer hooked up to the system. It's a simple test: you press a key which sends an electric signal through the electrodes, and if it works (it doesn't always) you can just about see a little jump of activity on a screen in response. What's on display is a moving graph which looks a bit like an EEG. I press the key a few times in quick succession, and the responses suddenly stop. Then there's a short, distinctive burst of energy on the chart. When I asked what happened, Dr Jordan said there was a lot they still don't understand about what the organoids do and why. Perhaps I annoyed them. Electrical stimulations are important first steps towards the team's bigger goal of triggering learning in the biocomputer's neurons so they can eventually adapt to perform tasks. ""For AI, it's always the same thing,"" he said. ""You give some input, you want some output that is used. “For instance, you give a picture of a cat, you want the output to say if it's a cat"", he explained. Keeping biocomputers alive Keeping an ordinary computer going is straightforward - it just needs a power supply - but what happens with biocomputers? It's a question scientists don't have an answer for yet. ""Organoids don't have blood vessels,"" said Simon Schultz, professor of Neurotechnology and Director of the Center for Neurotechnology at Imperial College London. ""The human brain has blood vessels that permeate throughout it at multiple scales and provide nutrients to keep it working well. ""We don't yet know how to make them properly. So this is the biggest ongoing challenge."" One thing is for sure though. When we talk about a computer dying, with ""wetware"" that is literally the case. FinalSpark has made some progress in the last four years: its organoids can now survive for up to four months. But there are some eerie findings associated with their eventual demise. Sometimes they observe a flurry of activity from the organoids before they die – similar to the increased heart rate and brain activity which has been observed in some humans at end-of-life. ""There have been a few events when we had a very fast increase in activity just the last minutes or 10s of seconds [of life],"" Dr Jordan said. ""I think we have recorded about 1,000 or 2,000 of these individual deaths across the past five years."" ""It's sad because we have to stop the experiment, understand the reason why it died, and then we do it again,"" he said. Prof Schultz agrees with that unsentimental approach ""We shouldn't be scared of them, they're just computers made out of a different substrate of a different material,"" he said. Real-world applications FinalSpark are not the only scientists working in the biocomputing space. Australian firm Cortical Labs announced in 2022 that it had managed to get artificial neurons to play the early computer game Pong. In the US, researchers at Johns Hopkins University are also building ""mini-brains"" to study how they process information – but in the context of drug development for neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and autism. The hope is that AI will soon be able to supercharge this kind of work. But, for now, Dr Lena Smirnova, who leads the research at Johns Hopkins University, believes wetware is scientifically exciting - but early stage. And she said there is little prospect of it taking the place of the main material currently used for computer chips. ""Biocomputing should complement – not replace – silicon AI, while also advancing disease modelling and reducing animal use,"" she said. Prof Schultz agrees: ""I think they won't be able to out-compete silicon on many things, but we'll find a niche,"" he suggested. Even as the tech comes ever closer to real world applications, however, Dr Jordan is still captivated by its sci-fi origins. ""I've always been fan of science fiction,"" he said. ""When you have a movie of science fiction, or a book, I always felt a bit sad because my life was not like in the book. Now I feel like I'm in the book, writing the book.""

Several major shops in Japan including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart had warned last week that they were running low on stocks of the beer after the hack affected Asahi Group's ordering and delivery systems in the country. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. The partially restarted breweries produce best-seller Asahi Super Dry, but the firm is also restarting plants that produce food and soft drinks. The cyber-attack is the latest to have affected operations at major firms, with carmaker Jaguar Land Rover still struggling to recover from an attack that shut down production. Asahi Group also owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, only Asahi's operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. Asahi said the re-opened beer plants in Japan were ""not yet fully operational"", and that two of its soft drinks factories that have partially re-opened were also not running at full capacity. It added there were a further five soft drinks factories that ""will resume gradually in accordance with shipments."" All seven of its food plants have resumed operations, though they are also not yet fully operational. Asahi said the production systems at the factories themselves had not been affected by the cyber-attack, but it had been forced to halt production because it could not process orders and shipments. On Friday, Asahi said said it was ""unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery"" but that it was working with external cyber-security experts to restore its systems as soon as possible.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yje27je5jo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4091/live/96d37ba0-a29e-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg,2025-10-06T10:06:27.146000+00:00,a6664436206ad028ff74599b9033d9e3564cb039

Do you agree with either of these statements? 

Illegal migrants come here and are a burden on services and the taxpayer. 
OR 
The only way to reduce inequality is to tax billionaires and giant companies who avoid tax.   

They may seem on opposite poles of the political spectrum, but both anti-migrant campaigners and anti-capitalists share an identical mindset. Both are demonstrating zero-sum thinking; the belief that if one group wins, another has to lose. 

In itself, zero-sum thinking isn't moral or immoral, right or wrong. But Economists claim it leads to poor economic policy, and they say evidence shows it is possible to create win-win situations for everyone. 

But many of the main parties at Westminster also use zero-sum thinking in their political rhetoric - from Reform and the Greens, to the Conservatives and Labour. Also, the first past the post electoral system is literally a zero-sum process. So is this kind of thinking baked-into UK politics? 

So are there particular groups of people that are more prone to zero-sum beliefs? Where did this mindset come from? What economic conditions encourage zero-sum thinking, and how deeply are these beliefs held?
