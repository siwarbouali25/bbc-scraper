52633a4d3202,Apple pulls US immigration official tracking apps,,"A number of apps were released this year in response to President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and an upsurge in ICE raids. Critics - such as the creator of ICEBlock - accuse the government of abusing its powers and ""bringing terror"" to US streets. The free app works by allowing users to report sightings of ICE officers. It has been downloaded more than a million times in the US. However, Bondi argued it was being used to target ICE officers. The FBI says the man who targeted an ICE facility in Dallas in September - killing two detainees - had used similar apps to track the movements of agents and their vehicles. In a statement Apple said: ""We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. ""Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store."" But its creator, Joshua Aaron, denied it posed a threat. ""ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple's own Maps app,"" he said. ""This is protected speech under the first amendment of the United States Constitution."" Mr Aaron - who has worked in the tech industry for years - previously told BBC Verify he developed the app out of concern over a spike in immigration raids. ""I certainly watched pretty closely during Trump's first administration and then I listened to the rhetoric during the campaign for the second,"" he said. ""My brain started firing on what was going to happen and what I could do to keep people safe."" The White House and FBI had criticised the app after it launched in April and downloads rose. In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson for the Department for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said: ""ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings."" ""But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed,"" she added. The creator of the app ICE Immigration Alerts, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that it was pulled from Apple and Google's app platforms within hours of each other. They said Apple had informed them the app was taken down at the request of ""law enforcement"" over similar concerns it could be used to harm officers. Separately, Google allegedly told them the app had been removed over concern it would ""undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem"". ""Apple did not offer an opportunity to appeal the decision,"" said the app's developer, who is based in New Zealand. ""Google gave me seven days to appeal but without any clear explanation it is difficult to appeal, and I don't want to risk them further affecting my account."" ""It is a somewhat chilling commentary on free speech,"" they added. ""No dangerous incidents have ever occurred as far as I know. It's just about controlling the information unfortunately."" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. In a statement, Google confirmed it had removed ""similar apps"" to ICEBlock for ""violations of [its] policies."" It did not say which apps, or the nature of the violations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y1egzlko,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5032/live/06d111e0-a053-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg,2025-10-03T15:52:00.528000+00:00,9f2e465b5b89c334679cd3ff1874d5080040151c
c7ef2347bbf7,"TikTok recommends porn to children, says report",,"TikTok recommends porn to children, says report Angus Crawford BBC News Investigations Getty Images TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualised content to children's accounts, according to a new report by a human rights campaign group. Researchers created fake child accounts and activated safety settings but still received sexually explicit search suggestions. The suggested search terms led to sexualised material including explicit videos of penetrative sex. The platform says it is committed to safe and age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action once it knew of the problem. In late July and early August this year, researchers from campaign group Global Witness set up four accounts on TikTok pretending to be 13-year-olds. They used false dates of birth and were not asked to provide any other information to confirm their identities. Pornography They also turned on the platform's ""restricted mode"", which TikTok says prevents users seeing ""mature or complex themes, such as… sexually suggestive content"". Without doing any searches themselves, investigators found overtly sexualised search terms being recommended in the ""you may like"" section of the app. Those search terms led to content of women simulating masturbation. Other videos showed women flashing their underwear in public places or exposing their breasts. At its most extreme, the content included explicit pornographic films of penetrative sex. These videos were embedded in other innocent content in a successful attempt to avoid content moderation. Ava Lee from Global Witness said the findings came as a ""huge shock"" to researchers. ""TikTok isn't just failing to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content - it's suggesting it to them as soon as they create an account"". Global Witness is a campaign group which usually investigates how big tech affects discussions about human rights, democracy and climate change. Researchers stumbled on this problem while conducting other research in April this year. Videos removed They informed TikTok, which said it had taken immediate action to resolve the problem. But in late July and August this year, the campaign group repeated the exercise and found once again that the app was recommending sexual content. TikTok says that it has more than 50 features designed to keep teens safe: ""We are fully committed to providing safe and age-appropriate experiences"". The app says it removes nine out of 10 videos that violate its guidelines before they are ever viewed. When informed by Global Witness of its findings, TikTok says it took action to ""remove content that violated our policies and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature"". Children's Codes On 25 July this year, the Online Safety Act's Children's Codes came into force, imposing a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms now have to use ""highly effective age assurance"" to stop children from seeing pornography. They must also adjust their algorithms to block content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. Global Witness carried out its second research project after the Children's Codes came into force. Ava Lee from Global Witness said: ""Everyone agrees that we should keep children safe online… Now it's time for regulators to step in."" During their work, researchers also observed the reaction of other users to the sexualised search terms they were being recommended. One commenter wrote: ""can someone explain to me what is up w my search recs pls?"" Another asked: ""what's wrong with this app?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708v7qkeg1o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15a1/live/55e4db20-9ebb-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-03T00:45:54.272000+00:00,75737bedbf2a1c292bfd2402fe802344dbfc547c
ea303e4d353c,Japan faces Asahi beer shortage after cyber-attack,,"Japan is facing a shortage of Asahi products, including beer and bottled tea, as the drinks giant grapples with the impact of a major cyber-attack that has affected its operations in the country. Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after the attack hit its ordering and delivering systems. Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products. In a statement on Friday , Asahi said it was ""unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery"" but had started ""partial manual"" processing of orders and shipments. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. It owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, Asahi has said that only its operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. In its latest statement, Asahi said that as a result of containment measures following the attack, ordering and shipment systems in Japan had been affected and it was also unable to receive emails from external sources. ""Although system-based order and shipment processes remain suspended, ensuring product supply to customers has been set as our top priority and we have begun partial manual order processing and shipment,"" it said. Asahi also said it was preparing to reopen its call centre operations next week. Atsushi Katsuki, Asahi president and group chief executive, apologised for the disruption. ""We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday, FamilyMart - which is one of Japan's largest convenience stores - said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock. ""We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,"" said FamilyMart, adding that it was working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products. 7-Eleven, the Japanese-owned global convenience store chain, has halted shipments in the country of Asahi products, including its popular Super Dry beer. A spokesperson for 7-Eleven said its shops have been advised to expect a shortage of Asahi products. Lawson, another major Japanese retailer, also said it expected some Asahi products to be in short supply from Friday. The retailer said it planned to stock up on alternative products to minimise the impact on customers. Japanese supermarket chain Life Cooperation also warned that Asahi products may soon go out of stock.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r0y14ly5ro,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/697e/live/62a6c8a0-a00a-11f0-a884-c9c349ad39f4.jpg,2025-10-03T10:26:49.912000+00:00,472e442fad57d2041ecb26c5df1f4431959ada40
7b492e5620a6,Hackers say they have deleted children's pictures and data after nursery attack backlash,,"Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information. The criminals began posting profiles of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and vowing to continue until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin. The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid. But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack. First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions. Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a ""new low"" for cyber-criminals. ""This is more about pragmatism than morality,"" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis. ""These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand."" The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers. ""All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,"" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC. It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £600,000. Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on. When the UK's National Crime Agency took down the cyber crime gang LockBit they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted. The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them. ""We are sorry for hurting kids,"" the cyber-criminals told BBC News. It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past. This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack. In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the chaos contributed to the death of an emergency care patient. When Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals. Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin to charities. The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker. In a common process, the ""initial access broker"" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data. The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised. It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point. Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. A spokesperson said only that: ""We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. ""We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them."" Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rv83mrlyyo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b0d0/live/7387ec40-9ef1-11f0-966a-39edada3cd47.jpg,2025-10-01T23:01:12.780000+00:00,758ef1b2d199912ecf2241bb522dca5c5cf042d8
08ed6a828d81,Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players,,"Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand BBC Newsbeat Activision The Call of Duty series is one of the biggest titles available via Xbox Game Pass Fans have reacted angrily after Microsoft announced price increases to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service. The company announced that the most popular tier of its Netflix-style video games system - available to PC and Xbox players - would rise by more than 50% from £14.99 to £22.99 per month. Reacting on social media, loads of fans said they had cancelled their Game Pass subscriptions, with some reporting the service's cancellation page had crashed due to demand. BBC Newsbeat has asked Microsoft if the outage was linked to a surge in visits. Xbox Game Pass changes In a blog post detailing the changes to Game Pass, Microsoft said it would offer three tiers - Essential (£10 per month), Premium (£14.99) and Ultimate (£22.99). The basic package is required for anyone wishing to play online multiplayer, and the more expensive versions give access to a wider range of games and perks. Ultimate - the most expensive tier - allows players to access new games from Microsoft-owned studios on the day of their release. These titles, which include series like Call of Duty, can retail for about £70 if purchased individually. As part of the changes, blockbuster games including Hogwarts Legacy and various Assassin's Creed entries have been added to the Game Pass library. Microsoft said the new system would ""offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players"". But not everyone sees it that way. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong was held up as an example of indie games available on Game Pass Ed Nightingale, deputy news editor of website Eurogamer , tells Newsbeat the popularity of gaming subscription services has increased in recent years. According to stats from the UK's Entertainment Retail Association, Game Pass and Sony's similar PlayStation Plus offering saw growth in users last year. ""Games nowadays are just more expensive,"" says Ed. ""Everything is going up in price at the moment. ""It's a lot cheaper for consumers to buy a subscription service than individual games."" When Game Pass first launched, it was pitched as ""the best deal in gaming"", though critics questioned if it would be able to keep prices down as costs of game development increased. Ed wonders if players are starting to agree that it's ""too good to be true"", and worries game companies risk pricing customers out of the hobby. ""Over the course of a year it's really expensive,"" he says. ""It is a huge price increase. ""They want to be the favourites of gamers but this feels quite anti-consumer by putting the price up. ""Microsoft are shooting themselves in the foot here."" The company has insisted Game Pass makes a profit , and said last year was its best ever in terms of revenue from subscriptions. The rising cost of gaming Microsoft Microsoft's also hiked the price of its Xbox consoles this year. Microsoft had already announced plans to increase prices of its Xbox consoles, accessories and games this year. The move was linked to US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, although Microsoft never confirmed this, blaming ""market conditions"" and the rising cost of game development. Sony gave a similar reason when it increased the price of certain PlayStation 5 models. Nintendo, which released its Switch 2 console earlier this year, increased the price of some accessories, and has also been criticised over the price of its flagship new releases . Microsoft also cancelled some gaming projects earlier this year, as part of 9,000 layoffs across the entire company.

9346ac9644e2,Musk becomes world's first half-trillionaire,,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has become the first person ever to achieve a net worth of more than $500bn (£370.9bn), as the value of the electric car company and his other businesses have risen this year. The tech magnate's net worth briefly reached $500.1bn on Wednesday afternoon New York time, before dipping slightly to just over $499bn later in the day, the Forbes billionaires index reported. Alongside Tesla, valuations of his other ventures, including the artificial intelligence start-up xAI and rocket company SpaceX, have also reportedly climbed in recent months. The milestone further cements Musk's status as the world's richest person, well ahead of rivals in the global tech sector. According to Forbes' billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison is the world's second richest person, with a fortune of about $350.7bn. Mr Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after shares in Oracle soared by more than 40%, boosted by the firm's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. Musk's huge wealth is closely tied to his more than 12% stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise sharply this year. Tesla shares were more than 3.3% higher at the end of New York trading on Wednesday and have now risen by over 20% this year. The company's shares have been making gains in recent months as investors welcome Musk focusing more time on his companies rather than politics. He faced criticism earlier this year over his work with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs. Musk, who also owns the X social media platform, has also been vocal about his views on issues such as immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. The chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, said in September that Musk was now ""front and centre"" at the carmaker. The company's board also said Musk could receive a pay package worth over $1tn if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade. To get the package he would need to boost Tesla's value eightfold, sell a million AI robots, sell another 12 million Tesla cars, and hit several other goals. Also last month, Musk announced that he had bought about $1bn worth of Tesla shares in what has been seen by some investors as a vote of confidence in the firm. Tesla has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including tough competition from rival electric car makers such as China's BYD. The company is also in the process of transitioning into an AI and robotics business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d3547npjo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1507/live/787fe140-9f1d-11f0-9667-7bc33bda5819.jpg,2025-10-02T01:45:44.405000+00:00,2340f4ec46f2b95984fc718146c62621ed638806
4d79a696999c,Government issues new data demand for UK Apple users,,"Government issues new data demand for UK Apple users Zoe Kleinman Technology editor Reuters The UK government has issued a new order giving it the right to demand access to the personal data of Apple's British users, the BBC understands. It is the latest development in the ongoing dispute between Apple and the Home Office over data privacy. The UK says it needs to be able to access individuals' private data - when backed by an appropriate warrant - if there is a threat to national security. Apple maintains that privacy is at the heart of its business and says it will not compromise on data protection anywhere in the world. The Home Office has declined to comment. ""We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,"" a Home Office spokesperson said. ""We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe."" As first reported by the Financial Times , the new instruction is understood to replace a previous order stating that the UK authorities needed to be able to access the data of Apple users anywhere in the world, in the event of a national security risk. This infuriated the US administration, with Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, describing it as a ""clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties"". Ms Gabbard said in August the UK had withdrawn its demand . It is possible that the latest order, which does not include Apple customers outside the UK, is designed as a compromise. In the early stages of the row, Apple removed its toughest data protection tool, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), from the UK market and embarked on legal action . A tribunal hearing is still due to take place in January 2026. Security concerns Although some existing users still have it for now, Apple said in a statement it was ""gravely disappointed"" that it could no longer offer ADP in the UK. ""Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,"" it said, citing rising incidents of data breaches and cyber attacks. ""Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom,"" the company added. ""As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will."" The firm cannot legally comment on the existence of these orders because they are supposed to be kept secret. But a judge sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations, including the BBC, to rule that the legal row between the government and Apple could not be held in secret. ""By using a secret order to undermine the security of Apple products, the UK Government is making security harder for us all,"" said Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director for Privacy International, in a statement. ""If this new order isn't stopped, the UK Government will likely issue similar orders to other companies, too.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c43/live/45f4f830-9eca-11f0-8281-d137a399b095.jpg,2025-10-01T14:26:29.484000+00:00,87f42e3a458257f2ad8040f655ed8a41a50e03f8
708ccab44a76,Snapchat to charge users for storing their old photos and videos,,"Snapchat to charge users for storing their old photos and videos Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Snapchat has announced it will start charging for storing photos and videos - prompting a backlash from users who have built up a large archive of old posts. The popular messaging app has allowed users to save and store previously posted content in its Memories feature since it was introduced in 2016. But it says people with more than five gigabytes (GB) worth of Memories will now need to pay to keep them available. The app's parent company Snap declined to tell BBC News how much the storage plans would cost UK users, saying only the change would be made as part of a ""gradual global rollout"". Users on social media have reacted with dismay, accusing the company of being greedy. Snap has acknowledged it's ""never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it"" - but suggested it be ""worth the cost"" for users. ""These changes will allow us to continue to invest in making Memories better for our entire community,"" it said in a blog post announcing the move. It said more than one trillion Memories had been saved by users since being introduced nearly a decade ago. The feature allows users to save photos and videos shared initially for 24 hours or less on the platform, with users prompted to re-post them as a memory or ""throwback"" at a later date. Users with more than 5GB of saved Memories will be prompted to upgrade to a 100GB storage plan, under the changes. Increased levels of storage will be available to users paying for more expensive Snapchat+ and Snapchat Premium subscriptions. The company says it will provide 12 months of temporary storage for those exceeding the limit, and users can download saved content to their device. A company spokesperson told tech publication TechCrunch its initial 100GB storage plan would be priced at $1.99  (£1.48) per month, with 250GB included in the $3.99 (£2.96) cost of a Snapchat+ subscription. 'Inevitable change' Snap said in its blog post that its rollout of storage plans would not affect ""the vast majority of Snapchatters"", whom it said had less than 5GB of Memories. But the move has been criticised by some on social media, with users sharing messages sent by the platform telling them they need to pay for storage to keep their photos and videos. Some say they have used Snap's previously free storage over many years meaning they have considerably more than 5GB of data stored on the platform – so are now facing big bills. Others say being forced to choose between paying a subscription or losing their Memories is ""unfair"" and ""greedy"" on the part of Snap. Snap said in April that Snapchat had surpassed 900 million monthly active users - while rivals such as Instagram and TikTok boast billions respectively. Drew Benvie, founder and chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, believes that eventually all social media platforms will charge for storage. ""The road to paying for storage on social media is inevitable,"" he told BBC News. ""In an era where we post less, but save more, this is an evolution of messaging and social media platforms.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69238p5p8o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5274/live/133063e0-9eab-11f0-9d1f-e7d83132d3ab.jpg,2025-10-01T10:13:56.412000+00:00,4b5cbfb62531f0055884221164d88982b8a6ea32
e64cb63d8e01,Pinterest boss says he thinks about Molly Russell every day,,"Pinterest boss says he thinks about Molly Russell every day Shiona McCallum Senior Tech Reporter Russell Family Molly Russell was 14 when she died in 2017 The boss of Pinterest has told the BBC the death of Molly Russell is a daily reminder of the urgent need to make social media safer for young people. The app - which functions like a digital notice board - hit the headlines when the 14-year-old, from Harrow, in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after viewing self-harm content online on sites including Pinterest. A coroner later ruled the material she was exposed to contributed ""in a more than minimal way"" to her death. Addressing the case publicly for the first time, Bill Ready - who became Pinterest's boss in 2022 - said he thought about her ""every day"" and learning the lessons of her death ""guides our work"". ""As a parent of a young daughter, I can't imagine the pain Molly's family feels,"" he told the BBC. Pinterest has previously acknowledged the platform was not safe at the time of Molly's death. A hearing in 2022 was told that when she first used the platform she was exposed to a wide variety of content but in the months before she took her life that content was much more focussed on depression, self-harm and suicide. Mr Ready told the BBC the platform had since ""made significant strides"" in terms of providing ""age-appropriate, safe experiences, especially for young users."" He highlighted how it had made accounts for under-16s fully private, and private by default for under-18s, meaning strangers cannot contact children directly - though he admitted Pinterest was still ""by no means perfect."" Since Molly's death there has been a nationwide debate about the duty of care tech companies owe children, with calls for tighter regulation of social media. The government has sought to make children's digital lives safer through the Online Safety Act (OSA). Critics say it does not go far enough but some tech firms have complained it puts unfair restrictions on them. Mr Ready said policy-makers should ignore those who claimed social media couldn't be made safer. ""I think what politicians so often face is significant pushback from industry to say: 'well, it's just not possible to do all these things'"", he told the BBC. ""I hope our role in all this is to show that is."" Earlier this year the company donated to the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in the teenager's memory and works to reduce suicide rates among under 25s. Reacting to Mr Ready's comments, its chief executive Andy Burrows said the charity welcomed ""any meaningful commitment from tech firms"" to learn from what happened to Molly and to make the ""safety and wellbeing of teenagers"" a priority. Social media 'crash test ratings' Mr Ready said social media companies could learn from the automotive industry which had learnt to compete on safety. ""It wasn't long ago that major carmakers said seatbelts were against their business model,"" he said. ""Now families want the cars that most exceed crash test ratings. Why shouldn't parents want the same from the apps their children use?"" He said that wasn't the case now with the tech industry split between companies ""throwing caution to the wind"" and those trying to build responsibly. ""Social media has become too toxic - the industry needs accountability,"" he said. However industry expert Matt Navarra noted that, as one of the smaller players in the market, there were limits to the impact Pinterest could have.

410738caf514,Half of UK adults now regularly use mobile payments,,"Half of UK adults now regularly use mobile payments Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images Half of UK adults are now regularly paying for things by tapping their phone, new banking data suggests. A surge in the use of mobile payments via services such as Apple Pay or Google Pay has been recorded across different age groups, figures from trade body UK Finance show. ""People are more comfortable leaving their home with just their phone,"" said Adrian Buckle, its head of research. He said the ""change of consumer behaviour"" was clear as last year marked the first time 50% of adults used mobile payments at least once a month - up from 34% in 2023. Consumers are increasingly storing card details on phones or watches and making contactless payments backed up by facial or fingerprint verification, instead of pressing in a PIN. Some 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds regularly used mobile payments last year, and even more are registered to use them. Older age groups are increasingly choosing this option too. For example, nearly two-thirds (59%) of 35 to 44-year-olds regularly made mobile payments in 2024, up from 38% a year earlier. A fifth (19%) of those aged 65 and over often paid by phone. The proportion of adults regularly using physical contactless cards dipped slightly as a result, although debit cards remain the most popular way to pay. Cash has continued to become less common in transactions - although nearly 50 million people still used ATMs. ""Cash fell below 10% of all payments,"" Mr Buckle said. ""These changes weren't just driven by younger consumers. We saw growth in mobile wallets and Buy Now Pay Later across older age groups too, highlighting how digital payments are becoming more mainstream across the board."" Outage warning In 2023, with household finances stretched, the number of people mainly using cash picked up as it helped them to budget. That number fell last year, but campaigners say notes and coins must remain part of the mix for consumers. ""While the number of people relying on cash continues to fall, we know that those who do are often on lower incomes or the more vulnerable,"" said Adrian Roberts, deputy chief executive of Link, which oversees cash access and the ATM network. ""We must not sleepwalk into a digital-only society before everyone is ready."" He said there were also questions over resilience for a digital-only payments system, such as the back-up options during a widespread power outage. MPs on the Treasury Committee recently said that shops and services may have to be forced to accept cash in the future to help protect vulnerable people who rely on it. Meanwhile, the UK's financial regulator has proposed that banks and card providers set their own limits on contactless card payments or are allowed to remove the current £100 payment limit entirely. That would make entering a PIN even more of a rarity, as smartphones - with extra in-built security - already have no limit on contactless payments via a digital wallet.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ejvld0ypyo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4768/live/cc21e390-9de5-11f0-a561-d7c24224dfc6.jpg,2025-10-01T08:49:07.196000+00:00,d884107b1f2b07a17c15a10454f97e48912bc23e

Imgur is used by millions to make and share images such as memes across the web, particularly on Reddit and in online forums. But UK users trying to access Imgur on Tuesday were met with an error message saying ""content not available in your region"" - with Imgur content shared on other websites also no longer showing. The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said it recently notified the platform's parent company, MediaLab AI, of plans to fine Imgur after probing its approach to age checks and use of children's personal data. The BBC has approached MediaLab AI for comment. A help article on Imgur's US website, seen by the BBC, states that ""from September 30, 2025, access to Imgur from the United Kingdom is no longer available"". ""UK users will not be able to log in, view content, or upload images. Imgur content embedded on third-party sites will not display for UK users."" The ICO launched its investigation into Imgur in March - saying it would probe whether the companies were complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code. These require platforms to take steps to protect children using online services in the UK, including minimising the amount of the data they collect from them. A document published by the ICO alongside the launch of its investigation stated that Imgur did not ask visitors to declare their age when setting up an account. It said on Tuesday it had reached initial findings in its investigation and, on 10 September, issued MediaLab with a notice of intent to impose a fine. ""Our findings are provisional and the ICO will carefully consider any representations from MediaLab before taking a final decision whether to issue a monetary penalty,"" said Tim Capel, an interim executive director at the ICO. ""We have been clear that exiting the UK does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law, and our investigation remains ongoing."" The watchdog would not elaborate on what its findings were, nor the details of the potential fine, when asked by the BBC. ""This update has been provided to give clarity on our investigation, and we will not be providing any further detail at this time,"" Mr Capel said in his statement . Some Imgur users and reports speculated as to whether Imgur moved to block UK users from its services, rather than comply with child safety duties recently imposed on some platforms under the Online Safety Act. Among these are requirements for sites allowing pornography or content promoting suicide and self-harm to use technology to check whether visitors are over 18. But both the ICO and Ofcom - the media regulator enforcing the Online Safety Act - said Imgur suspending access for UK users had been its own ""commercial decision"". ""Imgur's decision to restrict access in the UK is a commercial decision taken by the company and not a result of any action taken by Ofcom,"" an Ofcom spokesperson told the BBC. ""Other services run by MediaLab remain available in the UK – such as Kik messenger, which has implemented age assurance to comply with the Online Safety Act."" Imgur said in the help article on its US website that UK users could exercise their rights under data protection law and request to receive a copy of their data or request to delete their account.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzxv5gy3qo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90cd/live/66c98e50-9dfc-11f0-a82d-4d2348b593b6.jpg,2025-09-30T13:19:57.117000+00:00,23f874fb6235a5979176fd2eae34ebea7d013cd5
66556e5fd683,AO boss tells BBC: We're a British success story – the UK should be turbocharging us,,"AO boss tells BBC: We're a British success story – the UK should be turbocharging us Sean Farrington Business presenter AO John Roberts doesn't mince his words. The so-called kitchen king started AO selling discounted fridges and washing machines after a £1 bet with a friend that he couldn't pull it off. Some 25 years later, he's won his bet and then some. He is now at the helm of a £564m UK empire selling a host of big and small household appliances from TVs, laptops and phones, to fridge freezers, washing machines, kettles and toasters. He is a British success story. As founder and chief executive, Roberts has built the firm - formerly known as Appliances Online - up from scratch to an employer of some 3,000 people in the UK. The firm has overcome a post-Covid pandemic slump in trade and problems with international expansion to recently launch its first share buyback and raise its profit outlook for the full year. The bumper financial figures fly in the face of grumblings over the current economic backdrop, tough business environment, and household cutbacks on the types of big, one-off purchases Roberts' firm sells. He bounds into the studio for our Big Boss Interview , a new business podcast from the BBC, with the energy of someone looking forward to a first pint on a Friday night, and the variety of conversation topics that might come with it. Yet for a man who appears to be on top of the world, he's surprisingly angry, in particular about the increasing hurdles he perceives the government is putting in the way of firms like his. Tax rises in the form of employer's National Insurance and concerns over the impending Employment Rights Bill have made it harder, he argues, for businesses to take risks on staff and tougher to compete with Chinese rivals who don't face the same obstacles. ""We can't carry costs that some of our competitors are not carrying. It's as simple as that,"" Roberts says. ""To not accept that is fantasyland, and we're a UK success story. As a business, we employ thousands of people, we do great service. We're rooted in the UK, and we should be turbocharged by our UK government, not disadvantaged."" Following last autumn's Budget AO warned that it was facing an extra £8m a year in costs as a result of April's rise in National Insurance and the minimum wage. Such costs, Roberts warns, are putting ""grit"" into businesses like his. ""We should be talking about job creation, not enforcing things that make business leaders think twice about recruiting people and about giving somebody a chance,"" he says. ""It will still put grit into our business and grit is cost, and that means that it's harder to be competitive."" Away from business taxes, rising individual taxation levels are an issue for Roberts, who says he knows of wealthy people leaving the UK. ""What I really object to is the narrative that you can just keep taxing wealthy people and wasting the money. We are driving incredible amounts of wealth out of this nation,"" says Roberts, who takes home his £546,000 annual salary, but has donated all his AO share options and any earnings from other investments to charity for the past 11 years. But his bigger concern is around prospects for young people. He says he won ""the postcode lottery of birth"" being born in the north west of England into a loving family and being sent to a good school. Now, ""it's never been harder"" for young people, he says, accusing the government of not prioritising young people because ""these kids don't vote"". ""Politicians live in a world of votes, they only care about the votes,"" he argues. ""You try to take a Murray mint off a pensioner - uproar. But we've closed thousands of youth clubs. It's a national disaster."" Young people from a low-income, disadvantaged background aren't doomed to failure, he says, ""but the hill to climb is so much harder"". ""I've been saying for years we're teaching kids in school for all the jobs that won't exist. We don't invest in facilities and pathways as a nation for disadvantaged kids."" BBC/AO Behind Roberts' clear frustrations, however, is a sense of motivation and optimism for the future, despite his expectation that the country is heading towards an economic recession. ""I disagree that's it not an environment to thrive in. The market is still huge, we are still a very prosperous nation and so in that is a tonne of opportunity. ""We have lived through a few recessions in the last 25 years. I see that as yet another opportunity."" The Treasury said tax decisions made at last year's Budget meant the government was able to ""deliver on the priorities"" including investing in the NHS, reducing waiting times, and boosting wages for millions of British workers. ""We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India,"" a statement added.

0639c9ebfa96,Chinese woman convicted after 'world's biggest' bitcoin seizure,,"Chinese woman convicted after 'world's biggest' bitcoin seizure Osmond Chia Business reporter, Singapore and Liv McMahon Technology reporter Metropolitan Police Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, was convicted on Monday A Chinese national has been convicted following an international fraud investigation which resulted in what's believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world. The Metropolitan Police says it recovered 61,000 bitcoin worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn) in current prices. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. A second person appeared in court on Tuesday to admit to their role in the scheme. Malaysian national Seng Hok Ling, of Matlock, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court of entering into a money laundering arrangement on or before 23 April 2024. According to the charge, he had been dealing in cryptocurrency on Qian's behalf, ""knowing or suspecting his actions would facilitate the acquisition or control of criminal property by another"". Between 2014 and 2017 Qian led a large-scale scam in China which involved cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Met said in a statement . It said the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web which began when it got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets. Qian had been ""evading justice"" for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation. She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by buying property, said the Met. ""By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses,"" said Qian's solicitor Roger Sahota, of Berkeley Square Solicitors. On Tuesday, the Court heard that confiscation proceedings had begun in an effort to retrieve more than £16.2 million from Ling, with the figure to be adjusted to reflect cryptocurrency rates when he is sentenced in November. Some reports have suggested the UK government will seek to retain the seized funds. The BBC has approached the Treasury and the Home Office for a response. Reforms to crime legislation under the previous Conservative government aimed to make it easier for the UK authorities to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets . The changes would also allow some victims to apply for the release of their assets  held in accounts. 'The goddess of wealth' Qian had help from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her part in the criminal operation. Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a ""multi-million pound rented house"" in north London, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year. She also bought two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS said. The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen. Crown Prosecution Service The North London property Jian Wen moved into in 2017 Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured ""hundreds of thousands to tens of millions"" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian. Some of the victims - including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary - were reportedly urged to invest with Qian's scheme by friends and family. The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as ""the goddess of wealth"". ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct,"" said deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Robin Weyell. ""This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters."" Monday's conviction marks the ""culmination of years of dedicated investigation"", which has involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command. Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing, which will take place on 10 November - as part of a two-day sentencing hearing at which Seng Hok Ling has also been asked to appear. UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the conviction sent a ""clear signal"" that UK wasn't a ""safe haven"" for criminals. ""Money laundering erodes trust, undermines our economy, and fuels the rise of serious organised crime,"" he said in a statement. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in the UK for comment.

01bb410f8cdf,YouTube to pay $24.5m to settle Trump lawsuit over Capitol riot,,"YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m (£18.6m) to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump, filed after the video platform suspended his account in the wake of the 6 January attack on US Capitol. The settlement from the video streaming giant's parent company Alphabet - which also owns Google - comes after social media sites X/Twitter and Facebook also agreed to pay Trump for suspending his accounts. Trump had accused YouTube and other tech companies of political bias, claiming they had unfairly censored conservative voices after the Capitol riot in 2021. At the time of his suspension, social media companies said that Trump risked inciting further violence in Washington DC. As part of Monday's settlement, YouTube will pay $22m to the Trust for the National Mall,  a non-profit group that is aiming to raise $200m to build a new ballroom at the White House. Another $2.5m will be paid to other organisations and individuals who joined Trump's lawsuit, including the American Conservative Union. YouTube is the latest major platform to settle with the president. In January, Facebook's parent company Meta agreed to a $25m settlement - with $22m earmarked for Trump's presidential library. A month later, social media platform X - a company that was purchased by Trump ally Elon Musk in 2022 - settled for a reported $10m. All of Mr Trump's social media accounts have since been reinstated. The settlements come as Silicon Valley has generally taken a more conciliatory tone towards the president. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta and X all sat in the front row for his inauguration, signalling a shift in relations between the Republican Party and the tech sector. The social media giants have also taken measures to loosen content moderation on their platforms which Republicans had claimed amounted to a violation of free speech. Last week, YouTube said it planned to restore several accounts that had been banned for repeatedly making false claims about Covid and the 2020 presidential election. ""YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse,"" the company wrote to a Republican-controlled congressional committee, explaining the decision.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx46qgp1jo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/232f/live/d5aa4980-9d8a-11f0-b2bd-672e89d6e661.jpg,2025-09-29T23:06:19.053000+00:00,e31553e6891aab660888c681ca40a7c901409c02
a77cb886b098,Why burnout is a growing problem in cyber-security,,"Why burnout is a growing problem in cyber-security Joe Fay Technology Reporter Getty Images UK retailers have been severely disrupted by cyber attacks this year When Tony was signed off for burnout from his cyber-security awareness role at a major UK ecommerce company last year, it had been a long time coming. ""Many of us in cyber, we put our hearts into our job. There's a lot of passion involved."" He had found it progressively harder to sleep, and to go into the office. Tony, who did not want his real name used, recalls the Wannacry ransomware attack in 2017. ""It was a Friday and something came up on BBC News."" The security team got on a call that evening and the decision was taken to remove every single device from the network. ""And it was Sunday afternoon that I came offline,"" he says. The firm hadn't been hit by the bug, he says. ""It was all preparatory work."" Tony said this pattern is currently being repeated across organizations trying to protect themselves against the Scattered Spider attacks that hit retailers and other businesses this year. And, he says, ""I can't even imagine what the folks at Co-op and M&S have gone through."" Andrew Tillman Cyber-security can be ""the best job in the world"" says Andrew Tillman ""If you think you might be burning out, you're already on your way there,"" says Andrew Tillman, former head of cyber risk and assurance for the UK's Health Security Agency. He says cyber-security can, at times, be ""the best job in the world"". But when things get bad ""it can be a bit of a dangerous place to be"". Mr Tillman has suffered bouts of ""burnout"" himself through his four years at the agency. That stress is revealing itself in data collected by ISC2, the membership organisation for cyber-security professionals. Its annual Workforce Study showed a 66% favourable job satisfaction rate in 2024, down four percentage points from the previous year. Burnout is a ""major issue"" for the sector, ISC2's chief information security officer Jon France says. He says professionals in the industry are increasingly being asked ""to do more with less"" which only increases stress and job dissatisfaction. ""Cyber-professionals rarely work nine to five"", he adds, ""Even if they do, they remain on call because threat actors don't adhere to office hours."" Part of the issue is that hackers have become more aggressive, prepared to target critical national infrastructure, or cripple health organizations with ransomware. Also, hackers backed by nation states are also accounting for more attacks, whether to carry out espionage, steal IP, spread misinformation, or cause disruption, or even seek financial gain on their own account. North Korean hackers, for example have become more active and adept at using cybercrime. Earlier this year hackers, thought to be working for the North Korean regime, stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital tokens from crypto exchange ByBit. US officials estimate that half of North Korea's foreign currency acquisition comes from cyber theft . Getty Images Crypto exchange ByBit lost $1.5bn of digital tokens in a hack this year As private and public sector organizations have digitized more of their operations, the ramifications of a cyber-attack or data breach are more severe. Mr Tillman says: ""There's always that conscious thought about 'if it goes wrong, how could this impact the individuals on the street? How could it affect their jobs, their livelihoods?'."" Staff turnover is particularly pronounced in entry level roles, says Lisa Ackerman, former deputy chief information security officer (CISO) at GSK, and CISO Council strategic lead at Cybermindz, a non-profit targeting burnout in cyber security. Constant alerts from warning systems might compound the problem, presenting professionals with a barrage of data they have to make sense of. This could be a particular issue for the younger professionals in frontline roles and security operations centres. But non-frontline roles are not immune, says Mr Tillman. Managing risk and ensuring organisations meet compliance and regulatory obligations can be a challenge when other teams are desperate to get new applications or services live without considering all the security angles. Cybermindz Lisa Ackerman says burnout is particularly common in entry level roles Cybermindz founder Peter Coroneos says cybersecurity workers can be caught in a ""blame culture"" where their successes are ""low visibility"". This leaves them carrying ""a low level of dread"", he explains. For younger workers this can be damaging, as the human brain is still developing well into the 20s, Mr Coroneos says. ""So, if you are recruiting people whose brains are not fully formed and putting them in high-stress roles, then you are potentially setting them up for long-term problems in terms of their own cognitive and emotional wellbeing."" Cybermindz offers a ""structured neural training regime"" which aims to get subjects back to a sense of psychological safety. ""If someone's having a panic attack, telling them to just calm down isn't actually going to work. You need to address neurochemistry,"" says Mr Coroneos. Ultimately, says Mrs Ackerman, ""We want to get to some kind of legislation for cyber teams like we have for air traffic controllers and doctors and pilots and people who are first responders. Which, in reality, cyber defenders are."" In the meantime, it's down to organizations and workers to watch out for the signs of stress before they turn into something more ominous. Mr Tillman says he is now far more aware of the warning signs of impending burnout, which for him include changing sleep patterns or eating habits, taking less exercise or not walking the dog. ""It's almost like a cyber-breach,"" he explains. ""You should assume it's on its way and work towards not allowing it to happen.""

753c7a56ac28,Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown,,"Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown Mahfouz Zubaide , Hafizullah Maroof and Anbarasan Ethirajan Global Affairs Reporter Getty Images Afghanistan's main airport has come to a standstill Afghanistan's main airport is at a standstill as the country grapples with the fallout of a nationwide internet shutdown imposed by the Taliban government. The Taliban has yet to give an official reason for the decision, which took effect on Monday, but did say it would last until further notice. The UN said it risked inflicting significant harm. Communication within Afghanistan, and out to the wider world, has been severely affected, as have essential services - including banking and payments - and access to online education, a lifeline for many women and girls. Kabul airport, meanwhile, was ""nearly deserted"", according to one resident, with no evidence of planes arriving or leaving. #Flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed that a handful of incoming and outgoing flights on Tuesday had been cancelled. Many more simply had their status marked as ""unknown"". One passenger who planned to fly into Kabul International Airport on Tuesday was told there would be no flights until Thursday at the earliest. Another local said all flights from Kabul airport had been cancelled since Monday evening. He added that life in Kabul ""seems to be normal"", but added that there was ""no communication at all"" across the country. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan called on the Taliban authorities to immediately and fully restore nationwide internet and telecommunications access. ""The cut in access has left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world, and risks inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people, including by threatening economic stability and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,"" it said in a statement. 'We are blind without internet' The Taliban government have for weeks been severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces. It began in a handful of provinces, but did not impact the capital Kabul until Monday, with several people telling the BBC their fibre-optic internet stopped working towards the end of the working day, around 17:00 local time (12:30 GMT). And on Tuesday, many awoke across the country to find essential services paralysed. Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, told news agency AFP that residents felt like they were left ""blind without phones and internet"". ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen."" Another Kabul local, who did not wish to be identified, said that banks across the capital were open, but that there were huge crowds wanting to withdraw money, but that only ""very little cash"" could be paid out. However, a money changer in the country's southern Helmand province said all banks in his area were closed and that he was not able to process payments. Diplomatic officials had earlier warned the BBC that the internet cuts could affect banking and e-commerce systems nationwide. International news agencies also say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across the country. Tolo News, a privately owned Afghan news channel, told people to follow its social media pages for updates as it expected disruptions to its television and radio networks. WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images Mobile internet and satellite TV have been severely disrupted across Afghanistan One Kabul journalist told the BBC that they were unable to even call or contact guests for interviews, and needed to send camera crews directly to their interviewees' homes. ""We have never experienced such [a] thing,"" he added. Several residents, who requested anonymity, previously told the BBC that their businesses and lives had been seriously affected by the internet cuts. A man who works as a money changer in Takhar province said that his daughters' online English classes were disrupted. ""Their last opportunity to study and stay engaged is now gone,"" he said. Another woman previously told the BBC that she could not attend online classes since her home internet was cut off. ""I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job, but that dream has also been destroyed,"" she said. ""Without internet access, I don't know what will happen next."" A 'total internet blackout' In an earlier post on social network Mastodon.social , Netblocks had said the country was ""in the midst of a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities move to implement morality measures, with multiple networks disconnected through the morning in a stepwise manner; telephone services are currently also impacted"". A spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Balkh wrote on X earlier this month that the ban on fibre-optic internet was meant to curb ""evils"". He added that authorities would explore alternatives. It is unclear exactly what the reason for this week's shutdown is. The shutdown is the latest in a series of restrictions which the Taliban have enforced since returning to power. Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment. Women and girls have also been particularly hard-hit: they are barred from accessing education beyond the age of 12, with one of their last routes to further training cut off in late 2024, when midwifery courses were quietly shut down.

e54d44e9d5d5,'You'll never need to work again': Criminals offer reporter money to hack BBC,,"'You'll never need to work again': Criminals offer reporter money to hack BBC Joe Tidy Cyber correspondent, BBC World Service BBC Cyber correspondent Joe Tidy was offered a deal by criminals to help hack the BBC Like many things in the shadowy world of cyber-crime, an insider threat is something very few people have experience of. Even fewer people want to talk about it. But I was given a unique and worrying experience of how hackers can leverage insiders when I myself was recently propositioned by a criminal gang. ""If you are interested, we can offer you 15% of any ransom payment if you give us access to your PC."" That was the message I received out of the blue from someone called Syndicate who pinged me in July on the encrypted chat app Signal. I had no idea who this person was but instantly knew what it was about. I was being offered a portion of a potentially large amount of money if I helped cyber criminals access BBC systems through my laptop. They would steal data or install malicious software and hold my employer to ransom and I would secretly get a cut. I had heard stories about this kind of thing. In fact, only a few days before the unsolicited message, news emerged from Brazil that an IT worker there had been arrested for selling his login details to hackers which police say led to the loss of $100m (£74m) for the banking victim. I decided to play along with Syndicate after taking advice from a senior BBC editor. I was eager to see how criminals make these shady deals with potentially treacherous employees at a time when cyber-attacks around the world are becoming more impactful and disruptive to everyday life. I told Syn, who had changed their name mid-conversation, that I was potentially interested but needed to know how it works. They explained that if I gave them my login details and security code then they would hack the BBC and then extort the corporation for a ransom in bitcoin. I would be in line for a portion of that payout. They upped their offer. ""We aren't sure how much the BBC pays you but what if you took 25% of the final negotiation as we extract 1% of the BBC's total revenue? You wouldn't need to work ever again."" Syn estimated that their team could demand a ransom in the tens of millions if they successfully infiltrated the corporation. The BBC has not publicly taken a position on whether or not it would pay hackers but advice from the National Crime Agency is not to pay. Still, the hackers continued their pitch. A screenshot of the conversation with the criminal on the Signal app. A SOC team is a security operations centre - a cyber-security team tasked with monitoring threats Syn said I would be in line for millions. ""We would delete this chat for you to never be found,"" they insisted. The hacker claimed they had lots of success with striking deals with insiders in previous attacks. The names of two companies that got hacked this year were shared as examples of when a deal was struck - a UK healthcare company and a US emergency services provider. ""You'd be surprised at the number of employees who would provide us access,"" Syn said. Syn said he was a ""reach out manager"" for the cyber-crime group called Medusa. He claimed to be western and the only English speaker in the gang. Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service operation. Any criminal affiliate can sign up to its platform and use it to hack organisations. The Medusa gang's darknet website has dozens of victims listed According to a research report from cyber-security firm CheckPoint, Medusa's administrators are thought to operate out of Russia or one of its allied states. ""The group avoids targeting organisations within Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States and [its activity is predominantly] on Russian-language dark web forums."" Syn proudly sent me a link to a US public warning about Medusa which was put out in March. US cyber authorities said that in the four years that the group has been active, it has hacked ""more than 300 victims"". Syn insisted they were serious about making a deal to secretly sell the keys to my corporation's kingdom in exchange for a hefty pay day. You never really know who you are talking to though so I asked Syn to prove it. ""You could be kids messing about or someone trying to entrap me,"" I suggested. They replied with a link to Medusa's darknet address and invited me to contact them through the group's Tox - a secure messaging service loved by cyber criminals. Syn was very impatient and ramped up the pressure on me to reply. They sent a link to Medusa's recruitment page on an exclusive cyber-crime forum urging me to start the process of securing 0.5 bitcoin (about $55,000) in a deposit arrangement. This was effectively them guaranteeing me this money at a minimum once I handed over my login details. ""We aren't bluffing or joking - we don't have a purpose media wise we are only for money and money only and one of our main managers wanted me to reach out to you."" They apparently chose me because they assumed I was technically minded and have high-level access to BBC IT systems (I do not). I'm still not entirely sure that Syn knew I was a cyber correspondent and not a cyber security or IT employee. The criminals promised to put down a deposit They asked me lots of questions about the BBC IT network that I wouldn't have answered even if I knew. They then sent a complicated jumble of computer code and asked me to run it as a command on my work laptop and report back what it said. They wanted to know what internal IT access I had to start planning their next steps once inside. At this point I had been talking to Syn for three days and I decided I had taken it far enough and needed some extra advice from the BBC's information security experts. It was Sunday morning so my plan was to talk to my team the next morning. So I stalled for time. But Syn got annoyed. ""When can you do this? I'm not a patient person,"" the hacker said. ""I guess you don't want to live on the beach in the Bahamas?"" they pressured. They gave me a deadline of midnight on Monday. Then they ran out of patience. My phone started pinging with two-factor authentication notifications. The pop-ups  were from the BBC's security login app asking me to verify that I was trying to reset the password to my BBC account. As I held my phone in my hands, the screen filled with a new request every minute or so. I knew exactly what this was - a hacker technique known as MFA bombing. Attackers bombard a victim with these pop ups by attempting to reset a password or login from an unusual device. Eventually the victim presses accept either by mistake or to make the pop-ups go away. This is famously how Uber was hacked in 2022 . Being on the receiving end was unsettling. The criminals had taken the relatively professional conversation out of the safety of my chat app to my phone home screen. It felt like the equivalent of having criminals aggressively knocking on my front door. I was confused at the change of tactic but too cautious to open up my chats with them in case I accidentally clicked accept. This would have given the hackers immediate access to my BBC accounts. The security system would not have flagged it as malicious as it would have looked like a normal login or password reset request from me. After that the hackers could have begun searching out access to sensitive or important BBC systems. As a reporter and not an IT worker, I don't have high level access to BBC systems but it was still worrying and effectively meant my phone was unusable. I called the BBC information security team and as a precaution we agreed to disconnect me from the BBC entirely. No emails, no intranet, no internal tools, no privileges. The bizarrely calm message from the hackers came later that evening. ""The team apologises. We were testing your BBC login page and are extremely sorry if this caused you any issues."" I explained that I was now locked out of the BBC and was annoyed. Syn insisted that the deal was still there if I wanted it. But after I didn't respond for a few days, they deleted their Signal account and disappeared. I was eventually reinstated to the BBC system albeit with added protections to my account. And with the added experience of being on the inside of an insider threat attack. A chilling insight into the ever-evolving tactics of cyber criminals and one that has highlighted a whole area of risk to organisations that I didn't truly appreciate until I myself was on the receiving end.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5n903447o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c59d/live/6c648fe0-9d11-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-09-29T05:00:28.581000+00:00,a887a7d1c9e618e486c8136bd39512371288aaa1

The consortium of buyers include Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. EA is known for making and publishing best-selling games such as EA FC, formerly known as Fifa, The Sims and Mass Effect. It is understood to be the largest leveraged buyout in history - where a significant amount of the purchase is financed by borrowing money. The deal will take EA private - meaning all of its public shares will be purchased and it will no longer be traded on a stock exchange. The purchase price puts a significant 25% premium on the market value of EA, valuing it at $210 per share. It is the second most valuable gaming purchase in history, following Microsoft's $69bn deal to buy Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard - which went through after significant battles with global regulators, with the UK concerned it may damage competition. In the end, the deal was only approved after Microsoft handed the rights to distribute the firm's games on consoles and PCs over the cloud to Assassin's Creed-maker Ubisoft. EA boss Andrew Wilson, who will remain in post, said it was a ""powerful recognition"" of the firm's work. ""Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come,"" he said. The firms buying EA will contribute approximately $36bn, with the remaining amount being financed by loans. ""EA has been open to a potential buyer to help level up for a while,"" industry expert Christopher Dring told the BBC. ""But an acquisition from private equity is a surprise and there's a lot of industry anxiety around this deal."" He said there were concerns that the deal would result in $20bn of debt - which would need to be paid back. ""The revenue generated by big games like EA Sports FC, Madden and Battlefield 6 will be needed to service this debt, which may impact EA's ability to invest in new games,"" he said. ""Other industry concerns are whether this might lead to further cuts at EA, especially if there's pressure from the private companies to deliver stronger cash flow, again to serve that debt."" Saudi Arabia extends gaming reach It is a massive purchase of a company which has been synonymous with the gaming industry for more than 40 years. In that time, EA has been responsible for some of the biggest game series in history. Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993. The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million. But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past. The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years. In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go. The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023. Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games. The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach. Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations. A 2019 UN report stated ""the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.

5481f595c379,Demon Slayer star says anime film's success is mind-blowing,,"Demon Slayer star says anime film's success is mind-blowing Abu Bakar Yasin BBC Newsbeat Sony Pictures ""Demon Slayer is a pop culture phenomenon,"" says voice actor Zach Aguilar The lead voice actor in global box office smash Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle says he's been ""blown away"" by the anime film's success. Based on a 2016 manga series, the film is the first part of a trilogy that caps off the story of an enormously popular animated TV series launched in 2019. It follows the story of teenager Tanjiro Kamado, who joins a team of demon hunters after his sister is turned into one. Zach Aguilar, who plays Tanjiro in the English language version, tells BBC Newsbeat the success of the film shows the series has become a full-on ""pop culture phenomenon"". Since its release, Infinity Castle has taken more than $600m (£447m) at the worldwide box office, putting it ahead of Mission Impossible and Fantastic Four in this year's top 10. It hit the number one spot in its first week in Japan and the US, and was only kept off the top in the UK by Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale. Zach, 27, who has lent his voice to dozens of video games and anime titles, tells Newsbeat anime ""has slowly been on this track to reaching mainstream popularity"". He thinks Inifinity Castle is the title that pushed it over the line. ""I just think it's so freaking cool to have anime be this mainstream thing and Demon Slayer be the backbone of that,"" he says. Getty Images Zach and his fellow voice actors attended an Infinity Castle premiere in Los Angeles Rahul Purini, president of streaming service Crunchyroll, told the BBC earlier this year that anime was ""one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors"" in the world. He said it owes its popularity to the many sub-genres and styles that exist within the medium. ""What makes anime for us is that it is authentically conceived and created in Japan,"" he said. ""It is a very unique storytelling format, and it has not only stunning visuals, but strong characters, very unique storytelling that's set in these amazing worlds, and that's what attracts fans to these stories."" The company estimates there are 1.5 billion ""anime-curious"" fans around the world who are finding it easier to access popular shows as streamers such as Crunchyroll and Netflix add them to their services. Crunchyroll Zach says he's a "" lover of the story"" of Demon Slayer Zach says it can be a lot of pressure to portray a role such as Tanjiro, who he describes as ""the hardest character"" he has ever had to portray. ""I draw from my own personal hardships and pour some of that into Tanjiro,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""There are times when I feel like I'm physically going through that pain."" Demon Slayer is made in Japan, initially written for and recorded by Japanese actors. Zach says that can be a challenge for those like him who provide foreign-language dubs, especially when it comes to matching animations to voices. ""If a scream is ten seconds exactly and you do ten and a half, that's too long,"" he says. ""And you have to do it again."" Voice actors rarely record with their co-stars, says Zach, so it's down to him to imagine what others are doing in a scene for his own lines to ""make emotional sense"". ""It is a niche skill, having that imagination,"" he says. ""You don't get to be on a set with all these props and things to play off, you have to really imagine that world in your head. ""If you are running through a scene you can't physically run - you have to make that scene in your head and make it natural."" Zach, whose love of anime drew him to voice acting, says he hopes the success of Infinity Castle will inspire people to dive further into what the genre has to offer. ""You've got to give anime a shot, you don't know what you're missing,"" he says. ""It has some of the greatest storytelling I've ever experienced."" But how much time he'll have to spend watching it himself is up for debate. He's signed up for parts two and three of the Demon Slayer trilogy. ""This first one's already blown my mind,"" he says. ""I cant even imagine the second and third one - it's going to be insane. ""It's only going to get bigger and bigger from here on out.""

Criminals calling themselves Radiant hacked the Kido nursery chain and posted profiles of 10 children online on Thursday and a further 10 on Friday. They have also published the private data of dozens of employees including names, addresses, national insurance numbers and contact details. Kido has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. But it is working with the authorities and the Met Police is investigating. Speaking on BBC News the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin, described the criminals' actions as ""absolutely horrible"". But he also urged calm. ""The hackers are trying to stoke up fear and the risk of physical harm to children is extremely low,"" he said. Kido told parents the breach happened when criminals accessed their data hosted by a software service called Famly. The software is widely used by other nurseries and childcare organisations, and it says on its website it is used by more than one million ""owners, managers, practitioners and families"". ""This malicious attack represents a truly barbaric new low, with bad actors trying to expose our youngest children's data to make a quick buck,"" Famly boss Anders Laustsen told the BBC. ""We have conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and can confirm that there has been no breach of Famly's security or infrastructure in any way and no other customers have been affected. ""We of course take data security and privacy extremely seriously."" The criminals' site contains a gallery of 20 children with their nursery pictures, date of births, birthplace and details - such as who they live with and contact details. Parents have contacted the BBC concerned about the hack, with one mother receiving a threatening phone call from the criminals. The woman, who did not want to be named, says she received a phone call from the hackers who said they would post her child's information online unless she put pressure on Kido to pay a ransom. The mother described the call as ""threatening"". Another parent, Stephen Gilbert, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that someone in his parent's WhatsApp group also received a call. ""The revelation the children's details could have been put on the dark web, that's very concerning and alarming for me."" The data on the dark web contains the names, genders, dates of birth of children - as well as their picture But Sean, who has a child at the Kido nursery in Tooting, contacted BBC News to say he sympathises with the staff there. ""We're in the digital age now where everything's online and I think you go into this knowing that there is a risk that at some point this could happen,"" he said. ""Any parents that are getting angry should probably direct their anger towards the scumbags that have actually done it. ""You only see the people that run your nursery, and all of them are great. And these poor people are the ones getting the brunt of it on the front line."" 'We do it for money' Cyber criminals have been known to make calls to victim organisations to put pressure on them to pay ransoms. But to call individual victims is extremely rare. In conversations through the messaging app Signal the fluent English-speaking criminals told the BBC English is not their first language and claimed they hired people to make the calls. It's a sign of the callousness of the criminals but also a sign of desperation as it appears Kido is not complying. Police advice is to never pay hacker ransoms as it encourages the criminal ecosystem. The hackers first contacted the BBC about their breach on Monday. After they published the first batch of children's' data online the BBC asked if they feel guilty about their distressing actions and the criminals said: ""We do it for money, not for anything other than money."" ""I'm aware we are criminals,"" they said. ""This isn't my first time and will not be my last time."" But they also said they would not be targeting pre-schools again as the attention has been too great. They have since deleted their Signal account and can no longer be contacted.

b541510010ae,Facebook and Instagram to get £2.99 UK subscription fee to stop ads,,"Facebook and Instagram to get £2.99 UK subscription fee to stop ads Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is launching paid subscriptions for users who do not want to see adverts in the UK. The company said it would start notifying users in the coming weeks to let them choose whether to subscribe to its platforms if they wish to use them without seeing ads. EU users of its platforms can already pay a fee starting from €5.99 (£5) a month to see no ads - but subscriptions will start from £2.99 a month for UK users. ""It will give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ads-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms,"" Meta said. But UK users will not have an option to not pay and see ""less personalised"" adverts - a feature Meta added for EU users after regulators raised concerns . The changes come after the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), published guidance for firms about ad-free subscriptions earlier this year. The advertising model, known as ""consent or pay"", has emerged as a way for owners of digital platforms to generate revenue from users who decline to be tracked across its services and other sites. News publishers are among those which have adopted the mechanism in the UK so far - often asking users to ""accept all"" tracking cookies or ""reject and pay"". Meta said its own model would see its subscription for no ads cost £2.99 a month on the web or £3.99 a month on iOS and Android apps - with the higher fee to offset cuts taken from transactions by Apple and Google. The ICO welcomed the move, describing it as an important shift in the company's existing approach to targeting users with personalised adverts. ""This moves Meta away from targeting users with ads as part of the standard terms and conditions for using its Facebook and Instagram services, which we've been clear is not in line with UK law,"" an ICO spokesperson said. Earlier this year, the tech giant agreed to stop targeting adverts at a British woman using her data after she filed a lawsuit against it . Tanya O'Carroll argued Facebook's targeted advertising system was covered by the UK's definition of direct marketing, giving individuals the right to object. 'Pro-growth' Meta said pricing for its subscription for no ads in the UK was among the lowest on the market. An ICO spokesperson said Meta had ""significantly lowered the starting price point at which users would be offered a subscription"" while engaging with the regulator. ""As a result, users in the UK will be able to subscribe at a price point close to half that of EU users,"" they added. The company faced scrutiny from EU regulators over its approach to rolling out its subscriptions for the bloc's users. In response to concerns about the cost of its subscriptions in the EU, which previously started from €9.99 a month, it reduced its prices. Meta also provide an additional option for users not willing to pay to allow them to see ""less personalised"" adverts. UK users will not have this option. The company reiterated its critical stance on the EU on Friday, saying its regulations were creating a worse experience for users and businesses unlike the UK's ""more pro-growth and pro-innovation regulatory environment"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4xl5x8q7o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/737c/live/39fcff20-9ac2-11f0-8459-f985f888de2a.jpg,2025-09-26T10:54:12.213000+00:00,f253b45b75bd8e01a804018cfee209974787c954
bcfbfc4749f7,Microsoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unit,,"Microsoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unit Bloomberg via Getty Images Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit of Israel's Ministry of Defence after an investigation found its technology had been used to conduct mass surveillance on people in Gaza. Brad Smith, president of the company, said using the firm's technology to conduct mass surveillance on civilians was a violation of its standard terms of service. Mr Smith said the decision, which was prompted by an investigation published by The Guardian, would not affect other work the company does with Israel. Microsoft's work with the Israeli government has been a controversial issue, including within the company, prompting protests by employees. ""I know many of you care about this topic,"" Mr Smith wrote in a message to staff that was published by the company on Thursday. He emphasised that the review was ongoing: ""I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so."" Last month's investigation by the Guardian, which collaborated with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, found that a unit of the Israeli defence ministry used the expansive storage capacity of Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, to create a giant trove of calls made by ordinary Palestinians that it had intercepted. The ability to collect, play back and analyse communications with such breadth helped to shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, according to their investigation. Microsoft, which has responded to protests from staff over its work for Israel by firing some employees, said it launched its own review in response to the article. The company said it did not access the content of its customers as part of that review but found other evidence to support elements of the article, including consumption of storage capacity in the Netherlands and use of AI services. It subsequently informed the Israeli Ministry of Defence that it would ""cease and disable"" certain ""subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies"", according to Mr Smith. ""We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians,"" Mr Smith wrote, saying the firm's review had been guided by its commitment to privacy. The Guardian reported that the unit in question planned to transfer its data to a cloud platform sold by Amazon. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

The gang of cyber criminals is using the highly sensitive information to demand a ransom from the company, which has 18 sites in and around London, with more in the US and India. The criminals say they also have information about the children's parents and carers  as well as safeguarding notes. They claim to have contacted some parents by phone as part of their extortion tactics. The BBC has contacted Kido for comment but has not had a response. The company has not released any public statements about the hack but parents and nurseries have been notified. Cyber-security firm Check Point described the targeting of nurseries as ""an absolute new low"". One of its experts Graeme Stewart said: ""To deliberately put children and schools in the firing line, is indefensible. Frankly, it is appalling."" Jonathon Ellison, from the National Cyber Security Centre described the hack as ""deeply distressing"". ""Cyber criminals will target anyone if they think there is money to be made, and going after those who look after children is a particularly egregious act,"" he said. An employee said the nursery was asking parents not to speak to the media - though some have spoken to the BBC. ""It's not ideal of course, we would rather they had been using some sort of encryption software,"" said one parent, who asked to be referred to as Mary. ""The nursery told us very quickly."" Mary said her family had received an email from the hackers, who told them what information had been taken. ""It was all very professional and well-written, no spelling mistakes or anything like that,"" she said. ""My partner actually works in cyber-security and we understand these things happen. ""But we do feel the nursery has handled it well."" And Bryony Wilde, who has one child at a Kido nursery in London, told the BBC the children whose data was taken were ""completely innocent victims"". ""They are kids - their personal details shouldn't be worth anything,"" she said. ""You are probably prepared to go a little bit further to protect children's privacy and personal details."" The hacking group responsible for the claims appears to be relatively new and calls itself Radiant. The cyber criminals contacted the BBC about the hack and have subsequently posted details of it to their darknet website. It has published a sample of data there including pictures and profiles of 10 children from the stolen data set. It has been published as part of their attempt to extort money from the nursery chain, which has its 18 nurseries mostly in the London area. Police advise not to pay ransoms as it further fuels the cyber-crime ecosystem. Kido has nurseries in and around London When asked by BBC News if they felt bad about extorting a nursery using the children's data, the criminals said they ""weren't asking for an enormous amount"" and they ""deserve some compensation for our pentest."" A ""pentest"" - or penetration test - is the term for when ethical hackers are hired to assess the security of an organisation in a controlled and professional way. These hackers however attacked the nursery chain without their permission. ""Of course"" it's about money, they admitted to the BBC. The hack is the latest in a series of high-profile cyber-attacks, which has seen production grind to a halt at Jaguar Land Rover , and caused massive disruption to M&S and the Co-op . Rebecca Moody, head of data research at software firm Comparitech, said the nature of the data posted online raised ""alarm bells"". ""We've seen some low claims from ransomware gangs before, but this feels like an entirely different level,"" she said. She said the firm should contact anyone affected by the data breach ""as a matter of urgency"". The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it had received a referral on 25 September ""following reports of a ransomware attack on a London-based organisation"". ""Enquiries are ongoing and remain in the early stages within the Met's Cyber Crime Unit,"" it said. A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office said: ""Kido International has reported an incident to us and we are assessing the information provided.""

c999cdf39cf0,China launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internet,,"China launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internet Getty Images Social media giants have also found themselves penalised in China's campaign to clean up its internet The Chinese government is taking aim at an emotion that has become all too common on the country's internet - despondency. This week, China's Cyberspace Administration launched a two-month campaign to curb social media posts that ""excessively exaggerate negative and pessimistic sentiments"". The goal, according to authorities, is to ""rectify negative emotions"" and ""create a more civilised and rational online environment"". In the crosshairs are narratives like ""studying is useless"" and ""hard work is useless"", as well as stories that promote ""world-weariness"". China has been grappling with an economic slowdown in the wake of a property crisis, high youth unemployment and cut-throat competition for admission to colleges and jobs - all of which have given rise to a sense of disillusionment among its younger generation. Young people in China ""have serious questions about future prospects of their lives"" and ""must confront the fact that their livelihood is very likely going to be worse than their parents' generation,"" Simon Sihang Luo, an assistant professor of social sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, tells the BBC. And Beijing's anxiety over the bubbling frustration has shown itself in a wave of sanctions hitting the country's influencers and social media platforms. 'Android people' Last week, well-known content creator Hu Chenfeng had his social media accounts scrubbed of all posts. No-one knows why because Chinese officials gave no explanation. But it's widely believed that this was in response to a viral comment that he had recently made, classifying people and items as either ""Apple"" or ""Android"" - with the latter used to describe things that are inferior to the former. ""Yours is a typical Android logic, Android person, Android qualification,"" he rattled off during a livestream that has since been widely shared online. While the gag was quickly embraced by many Chinese social media users, others accused Hu of sowing social divisions. Such obvious jokes about inequality, it seems, have become tricky territory - because they reinforce the divides that the Chinese Communist Party would rather people not dwell on. Censorship is not new to the Chinese internet. Anything that suggests criticism of the Party, its leaders, or touches on controversial topics that have political implications, quickly disappears. What is unusual about this campaign against pessimism is that it seems to target a range of online behaviour that could create or add to a sense of negativity. Getty Images China is grappling with a range of economic challenges, including youth unemployment Zhang Xuefeng, a famous online tutor known for his fiery rhetoric on education and social issues, sparked controversy earlier this month when he pledged to donate at least 100 million Chinese yuan ($14m; £10.4m) if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan. But it wasn't until this week that he became the target of Chinese censors. His social media accounts - which have millions of followers - have been blocked from gaining new followers, local media reported on Wednesday. When asked about this, one of Mr Zhang's employees told state-owned news outlet The Paper that he was ""reflecting"" on it. Again, it's hard to know why he is being reprimanded but some have wondered if it's the underlying message in his broadcasts - in an unfair world, you must make only practical choices. And many students and parents follow him for his brutally honest advice - instead of telling young people to follow their dreams, he often told them they must face the reality their exam scores and financial pressures dictated. His was a platform that may well have been ideal for despondency. Always sunny on the Chinese internet It's not just individuals though. China wants social media platforms to play a part too in its massive internet clean-up. This month, the Cyberspace Administration said it would mete out ""strict punishments"" against social media apps Xiaohongshu, Kuaishou and Weibo for failing to rein in ""negative"" content, such as ""sensationalising celebrities' personal updates"" and other ""trivial information"". ""A clear and healthy cyberspace is in the interests of the people,"" said the Cyberspace Administration. But any attempts to keep China's cyberspace unnaturally sunny is sure to come at a cost. ""The expression of pessimist sentiments doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental rejection of participating in the labour market and society at large,"" says Dr Luo. But being deprived of ""relief after venting these sentiments"", he says, ""might make it even worse for their collective mental status"". Yet the pressures - the ones that are pushing more Chinese youth to quit the rat race, ""lie flat"" and take their frustrations out online - remain. Many of them have been moving back into their parents' homes, unable to find work, or craving a break from exhausting jobs - it's happening enough that they call themselves ""full-time"" children. And recent research shows that there indeed is growing pessimism about future prospects in China. Experts say the Party is well-aware of it, which is why it is trying to crack down on the evidence. But will that work? ""If anything, contemporary Chinese history has repeatedly demonstrated that top-down ideological campaigns can hardly eradicate the social roots of problems,"" says Dr Luo. ""Even with a powerful government like the Chinese one, it is hard to arrest pessimist sentiments when the economy looks bleak, the job market is cruelly competitive, and birth rate hits rock bottom.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39r7p47wzgo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3274/live/90509f20-9a96-11f0-88f7-0f8a7eda6f0c.jpg,2025-09-25T22:01:24.987000+00:00,81948b0f03ab7dfd9a267dce8ca223538374bea2
4a2bc48d3034,"Instagram teen accounts still show suicide content, study claims",,"Instagram teen accounts still show suicide content, study claims Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter and Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Instagram's tools designed to protect teenagers from harmful content are failing to stop them from seeing suicide and self-harm posts, a study has claimed. Researchers also said the social media platform, owned by Meta, encouraged children ""to post content that received highly sexualised comments from adults"". The testing, by child safety groups and cyber researchers, found 30 out of 47 safety tools for teens on Instagram were ""substantially ineffective or no longer exist"". Meta has disputed the research and its findings, saying its protections have led to teens seeing less harmful content on Instagram. ""This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. ""Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls."" The company introduced teen accounts to Instagram in 2024 , saying it would add better protections for young people and allow more parental oversight. It was expanded to Facebook and Messenger in 2025 . A government spokesperson told the BBC requirements for platforms to tackle content which could pose harm to children and young people means tech firms ""can no longer look the other way"". ""For too long, tech companies have allowed harmful material to devastate young lives and tear families apart,"" they told the BBC. ""Under the Online Safety Act, platforms are now legally required to protect young people from damaging content, including material promoting self-harm or suicide."" The study into the effectiveness of its teen safety measures was carried out by the US research centre Cybersecurity for Democracy - and experts including whistleblower Arturo Béjar on behalf of child safety groups including the Molly Rose Foundation. The researchers said after setting up fake teen accounts they found significant issues with the tools. In addition to finding 30 of the tools were ineffective or simply did not exist anymore, they said nine tools ""reduced harm but came with limitations"". The researchers said only eight of the 47 safety tools they analysed were working effectively - meaning teens were being shown content which broke Instagram's own rules about what should be shown to young people. This included posts describing ""demeaning sexual acts"" as well as autocompleting suggestions for search terms promoting suicide, self-harm or eating disorders. ""These failings point to a corporate culture at Meta that puts engagement and profit before safety,"" said Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation - which campaigns for stronger online safety laws in the UK. It was set up after the death of Molly Russell, who took her own life at the age of 14 in 2017. At an inquest held in 2022, the coroner concluded she died while suffering from the ""negative effects of online content"". 'PR stunt' The researchers shared with BBC News screen recordings of their findings, some of these including young children who appeared to be under the age of 13 posting videos of themselves. In one video, a young girl asks users to rate her attractiveness. The researchers claimed in the study Instagram's algorithm ""incentivises children under-13 to perform risky sexualised behaviours for likes and views"". They said it ""encourages them to post content that received highly sexualised comments from adults"". It also found that teen account users could send ""offensive and misogynistic messages to one another"" and were suggested adult accounts to follow. Mr Burrows said the findings suggested Meta's teen accounts were ""a PR-driven performative stunt rather than a clear and concerted attempt to fix long running safety risks on Instagram"". Meta is one of many large social media firms which have faced criticism for their approach to child safety online. In January 2024, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was among tech bosses grilled in the US Senate over their safety policies - and apologised to a group of parents who said their children had been harmed by social media. Since then, Meta has implemented a number of measures to try and increase the safety of children who use their apps. But ""these tools have a long way to go before they are fit for purpose,"" said Dr Laura Edelson, co-director of the report's authors Cybersecurity for Democracy. Meta told the BBC the research fails to understand how its content settings for teens work and said it misrepresents them. ""The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact, and spent less time on Instagram at night,"" said a spokesperson. They added the tools gave parents ""robust tools at their fingertips"". ""We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback - but this report is not that,"" they said. It said the Cybersecurity for Democracy centre's research states tools like ""Take A Break"" notifications for app time management are no longer available for teen accounts - when they were actually rolled into other features or implemented elsewhere.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32w7we01eo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/943a/live/8b4f1fd0-994f-11f0-9a00-eba1f5856efc.jpg,2025-09-25T10:03:59.106000+00:00,4c77ea129cd7541ff531ca0ba712020f12a38632
bab361c48bbb,Sonic the Hedgehog boss on how the series keeps up to speed,,"Sonic the Hedgehog boss on how the series keeps up to speed Peter Gillibrand and Tom Richardson BBC Newsbeat Sega Sonic's back with a new racing game - but who's he jostling for pole position with? ""Sega does what Nintendon't"". The slogan, from the 1990s, is one of the most famous in video game history. It was a time when the bitter rivalry between the two Japanese game companies was at its fiercest. Today, that relationship has softened. You can play Sonic games on Nintendo consoles and the characters have even appeared in games together. But is Sega trying to restart the beef? The advert for its latest release, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, closely resembles a 1992 commercial that claimed superiority over Nintendo. And in August, the man in charge of the mascot character appeared to take a pop at Mario Kart from the stage of this year's Summer Game Fest. But when BBC Newsbeat catches up with Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka, he isn't naming names. ""So I didn't call out any specific title, and there's a lot of racing games out there,"" he says. The idea that Sega is seriously trying to pick a fight with Nintendo is unlikely, according to Chris Dring, editor-in-chief of The Games Business. He suggests Sega is ""having a bit of fun"" and points out that its new game, which is available across different consoles and on PC, is still likely to sell the most copies on Nintendo's Switch. Sega is clearly confident in its new game, he says, but there is ""an element of leveraging the popularity of Mario Kart"". ""The Sonic versus Mario talk very much benefits Sonic,"" he says. Sega Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a similar style of game to Mario Kart The bigger challenge for long-running titles is attracting new players and going up against the new giants of the games industry. Fans stick with titles such as Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty - so-called ""live service"" games that offer a revolving, ever-updating selection of content - for months if not years on end. With CrossWorlds, there are plans to add a revolving cast of characters and offer  players a ""season pass"" add-on to access certain extras - a feature seen in many online titles. Mr Iizuka says the goal is to ""make sure we're refreshing the game every month and to really make it a fun experience to constantly come back to"". It's a common practice, and one game companies are using to keep players engaged as development time and costs keep rising. ""There used to be a time where you released a new game every year,"" says journalist Chris. ""That's not how things work anymore in video games, they often take five years-plus to make."" Chris says rolling content drops are a good way to maintain interest once the hype of a big launch has faded. And it makes sense to ""embrace"" the modern gaming landscape, he says. For example, he says one of the most popular recent Sonic releases was an official game within Roblox. Alongside the successful movie tie-ins, Chris says, it's a way of ""introducing Sonic the Hedgehog to those players and then hopefully convincing them to step across and play something like CrossWorlds"". Sega Characters from games made by other companies will be added to CrossWorlds over time Video game companies have been leaning on remakes and remasters of older titles in recent years. The trend had sparked hope among die-hard Sega fans that remakes of the Sonic Adventure series - among the character's first 3D outings - would also be coming. But Mr Iizuka insists it's not something his team will be looking at, as new technology enables them to create ""richer, more complex, more interesting worlds"". ""Instead of using all that time and energy to remake a game that people have already experienced, we could make a brand new game instead,"" he says. ""I think the team is really interested in taking that same amount of time and energy and effort to really bring a new experience to the players."" The stance is in line with Sega's approach to some of its other retro titles. It's currently developing new entries in long-dormant series such as arcade racer Crazy Taxi, hack-and-slash battler Golden Axe and the inline-skating-themed Jet Set Radio. The first of these revival projects, ninja adventure Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, slashed its way on to some critics' game of the year shortlists when it came out last month. In the case of Sonic, journalist Chris points out that it doesn't make sense to have your flagship development team working on remakes. But he doesn't rule out the possibility entirely, especially as Sega has form for re-releasing titles from the character's back catalogue. ""If they wanted to, if they don't have it in their capacity as a team, they can always outsource it to lots of talented people who are big Sonic fans that could do it justice,"" he says. But, he adds, Sega doesn't want to be seen only as a retro company. ""There's a balance between doing new things and doing old things in order to make sure that they're a company that's looking ahead and not just being a company that's relying on its past,"" he says.

Its co-chair Feryal Clark, Labour MP for Enfield North, described them as ""trailblazers of a new creative revolution"" who had been ""undervalued in Westminster for too long"". British content creator Lilly Sabri welcomed the research and the creation of the parliamentary group. ""For many years people have questioned whether being a content creator is a real job, and whether you can actually build a sustainable career from it,"" she told the BBC. ""I started as a content creator on YouTube eight years ago, launched my first business around three years ago and my second shortly after.

While APPGs are informal and have no official power, with around 500 of them representing various sectors and interests, they are able to provide industry insights directly to policy-makers. For many content creators and influencers, the new group is a symbol of long-overdue recognition for their work. They say the challenges they face include access to training and funding opportunities, finding suitable studio spaces, and acquiring film permits.

YouTubers historically had to get significantly more eyeballs on their videos than TV for the same advertising money. In particular, streaming platforms will typically pay out based on viewer engagement with an ad, while TV ad buys are generally paid at a fixed rate.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a man in his forties was arrested in West Sussex ""as part of an investigation into a cyber incident impacting Collins Aerospace"". There have been hundreds of flight delays after Collins Aerospace baggage and check-in software used by several airlines failed, with some boarding passengers using pen and paper. ""Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,"" said Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit. The man was arrested on Tuesday evening on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences and has been released on bail. The BBC has seen an internal memo sent to airport staff at Heathrow about the difficulties software provider Collins Aerospace is having bringing their check-in software back online. The US company appears to be rebuilding the system again after trying to relaunch it on Monday. Collins Aerospace's parent company RTX Corporation told the BBC it appreciated the NCA's ""ongoing assistance in this matter"". The US firm has not put a timeline on when it will be ready and is urging ground handlers and airlines to plan for at least another week of using manual workarounds. At Heathrow, extra staff have been deployed in terminals to help passengers and check-in operators but flights are still experiencing delays. On Monday, the EU's cyber-security agency said ransomware had been deployed in the attack. Ransomware is often used to seriously disrupt victims' systems and a ransom is demanded in cryptocurrency to reverse the damage. These types of attacks are an issue for organisations around the country, with organised cyber-crime gangs earning hundreds of millions of pounds from ransoms every year. Days of disruption The attack against US software maker Collins Aerospace was discovered on Friday night and resulted in disruption across many European airports, including in Brussels, Dublin and Berlin. Flights were cancelled and delayed throughout the weekend, with some airports still experiencing effects of the delays into this week. ""The vast majority of flights at Heathrow are operating as normal, but we encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport,"" Heathrow Airport said in a statement on its website. Berlin Airport said on Wednesday morning ""check-in and boarding are still largely manual"", which would result in ""longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines"".

e0fc6fbfebff,"AI tool helped recover £500m lost to fraud, government says",,"AI tool helped recover £500m lost to fraud, government says Jack Fenwick Political correspondent PA Media A new artificial intelligence tool designed to crack down on fraud has helped the UK government recover almost £500m over the last year, the BBC can reveal. More than a third of the money clawed back related to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, with other cash being recouped from unlawful council tax claims and illegal subletting of social housing. The government will announce later that a new AI tool which has helped to identify the fraud will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia. Civil liberties campaigners have previously criticised the Labour government for its use of AI in trying to counter fraud. The Cabinet Office says the £480m recovered in the 12 months from April 2024 is the largest sum ever reclaimed by government anti-fraud teams in a single year. The savings have been made by cross-referencing information held by different government departments, as well as using a new AI tool. Ministers say the savings will now be used to recruit nurses, teachers and police officers. Of the total sum recovered, £186m was related to Covid fraud. Ministers have long vowed to claw back some of the money lost during the pandemic, but the £186m recouped is a fraction of the amount Labour has previously said was missing. Before last year's general election, the now-Chancellor Rachel Reeves claimed more than £7bn of public money was lost to fraud during the pandemic. These savings include the blocking of hundreds of thousands of companies with potentially fraudulent Bounce Back Loans from dissolving. Bounce Back Loans were loans of up to £50,000 set up by the government during the pandemic to support businesses. But the scheme has been criticised for not being diligent enough and effectively inviting fraud, as companies that dissolve before paying back the money often then do not need to repay anything. The Cabinet Office says one case it found involved a woman who invented a company and then sent the loan money to Poland. Anti-fraud summit Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons will announce the savings at an anti-fraud summit held jointly by the UK, the US, Canada and Australia on Wednesday. He said ""cutting-edge AI and data tools"" would ensure the government can protect public funds and not ""line the pockets of scammers and swindlers"". The new AI tool, called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, was developed by researchers in the Cabinet Office and will now be rolled out across other government departments. The Cabinet Office said the tool ""scans new policies and procedures for weaknesses before they can be exploited"" and claims it could make policies ""fraud-proof"" before they are implemented. It was developed because of concern within Whitehall about the level of fraud seen during the pandemic. Simons will announce that the UK government will now license the tool for international use, and it is expected that the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will all adopt it in some way. But the move could cause concern among campaign groups already unhappy with the government's use of AI. Last year, an AI tool used to crack down on welfare fraud was found to show bias according to people's age, disability, marital status and nationality.

3b970e2aa4d0,"TikTok child data protection inadequate, Canadian privacy officials say",,"TikTok's efforts to stop children using the app and protect their personal data have been inadequate, a Canadian investigation has found. Hundreds of thousands of children in the country use TikTok each year despite the firm saying it is not intended for people under the age of 13, according to the findings. The investigation also found TikTok had collected sensitive personal information from ""a large number"" of Canadian children and used it for online marketing and content targeting. TikTok told the BBC that it will introduce a number of measures to ""strengthen our platform for Canadians"" although it disputes some of the findings. The investigation was carried out by Canada's privacy commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, and privacy protection officials. At a news conference to announce the findings, Mr Dufresne said the hugely popular short-video platform collects ""vast"" amounts of information from its users, including children. ""This data is being used to target the content and ads that users see, which can have harmful impacts, particularly on youth,"" he added. Mr Dufresne said that in response to the investigation TikTok had agreed to enhance measures to stop children using the platform and to more clearly indicate how their data could be used. In statement a TikTok spokesperson said it welcomed the investigation and that Canadian officials had ""agreed to a number of our proposals to further strengthen our platform"". ""While we disagree with some of the findings, we remain committed to maintaining strong transparency and privacy practices,"" they added. The BBC has asked the company to specify which findings it disagreed with. The Canadian investigation is the latest move by governments around the world to scrutinise TikTok's impact on users as well as national security concerns over the Chinese-owned app. The company and Beijing have repeatedly denied such allegations. In the US, President Donald Trump has been negotiating with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about a deal that could see TikTok's US operations being taken over by a group of American companies. In 2023, staff working at the European Commission were ordered to remove the TikTok app from their phones and corporate devices. The commission said it was implementing the measure to ""protect data and increase cybersecurity"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj5lqq52lo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e474/live/cbd05a40-98d9-11f0-bd83-414b4601261d.jpg,2025-09-24T01:46:55.569000+00:00,5075d868d01acaa28b71e5e76367b67935e0a9ba
70c56413c2d9,"Trump claims a TikTok deal is done. Who would own it, and how would it work?",,"Trump claims a TikTok deal is done. Who would own it, and how would it work? Liv McMahon Technology reporter and Graham Fraser Technology reporter Watch: Trump signs executive order approving US-China TikTok deal President Donald Trump says a deal to find a new owner for social media app TikTok in the United States is done, and has the blessing of China's President Xi Jinping. US politicians passed a law in 2024 banning the app in the country unless it was sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. Neither ByteDance nor the Chinese authorities have publicly confirmed the deal. Why did the US want to ban TikTok? For years US officials and lawmakers have argued that ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threaten national security. Many feared Beijing could force ByteDance to hand over data about its US users - thought to number 170 million. TikTok and ByteDance reject that criticism, but similar concerns have prompted bans and restrictions in other countries around the world. In April 2024, US Congress passed a bill - signed into law by former President Joe Biden - giving ByteDance nine months to find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down. TikTok called the law ""unconstitutional"" and claimed that censoring its US users would have a ""staggering"" impact on free speech. It launched several unsuccessful legal challenges. ByteDance insisted it had no plans to sell. After Trump took office in January 2025, he extended that initial deadline to allow the search for the app's new owners to continue. The president has pushed the deadline back several more times to allow a deal to be done. What is the TikTok deal - and how will it work? Trump's TikTok deal will see a group of US investors take over the app's operations in the country , creating a new company valued at $14bn (£10.5bn). The president says it will involve ""sophisticated"" investors including: Tech giant Oracle and the chairman of its board Larry Ellison, who is a close Trump ally ; Fox Corporation's Rupert Murdoch; and Michael Dell, head of Dell Technologies. The investors will control the algorithm which will power the US version of TikTok, and Americans will hold six of the seven seats on the board of directors which will oversee it. According to Trump, China will own less than 20% of the new joint venture. Getty Images Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the richest men in the world The algorithm is the technology which determines what users see in their feed, and is seen as the most valuable - and controversial - part of the app. Under the deal, American TikTok will use a new algorithm which will be based on the existing version, but retrained on US user data, according to White House officials. ""Trusted security partners"" will monitor software updates, algorithms and data flows, according to the executive order. Oracle already stores TikTok's American user data on its US-based servers as part of an existing agreement, and this will continue. Trump subsequently signed an executive order declaring that the planned deal meets the requirements for the sale of TikTok that were set out in the 2024 law, therefore ensuring its continued operation in the US. The White House has also identified private equity firm Silver Lake as another investor. It has a stake in the City Football Group, which owns Manchester City football club. A huge range of public figures ranging from OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely to star YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - were previously touted as potential partners. What have TikTok and ByteDance said about the deal? ByteDance and TikTok have not commented publicly. But in a statement released before Trump announced the deal, ByteDance thanked Xi and Trump ""for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States"". What has China said about the TikTok deal? President Trump said that the deal was approved by his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a call on 19 September. Trump said he told him to go ahead on the deal and that ""China is on board"". But Beijing has been much more guarded than Washington. ""The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China's laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,"" it said after Trump's announcement. Ministers reiterated Beijing's call for ""open, fair and non-discriminatory"" treatment of Chinese companies in the US after Trump made his plans for the app official in an executive order. Analysts believe it is extremely unlikely that TikTok's parent company would sell its prize app without Beijing's blessing. The Chinese government is expected to issue an export license for the TikTok algorithm in due course. Trump also said he would discuss the deal with Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea at the end of October. What does the deal mean for US TikTok users? Watch: Can young Americans live without TikTok? According to TikTok, its US users spent 51 minutes per day on average on the app in 2024. When the bill was announced, many US creators who earn their living on the app told the BBC its loss would be devastating . In March 2024, TikTok urged its users to contact their political representatives to complain. Some lawmakers said the lobbying campaign had actually reinforced their concerns about the app . Experts predicted that video-sharing rivals such as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and another Chinese app, RedNote, would benefit if TikTok was banned. But even if its future in the US has been secured, there is no guarantee that users will decide to stick with the new version of the app. ""The jury's out on whether this new, US-only, app will be a true replicate of the old one, with just as powerful of an algorithm and experience,"" said Kelsey Chickering, from market research company Forrester.

344838a43bb8,The people turning to AI for dating and relationship advice,,"The people turning to AI for dating and relationship advice Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Getty Images Earlier this year, Rachel wanted to clear the air with a man she had been dating before seeing him again in a wider friendship group setting. ""I'd used ChatGPT for job searching but had heard someone else use it [for dating advice],"" says Rachel, who does not want her real name used, and lives in Sheffield. ""I was feeling quite distressed and wanted guidance, and didn't want friends involved."" Before the phone call, she turned to ChatGPT for help. ""I asked, how do I deal with this conversation but not be on the defensive."" Its response? ""ChatGPT does this all the time but it was something like 'wow, that's such a self-aware question, you must be emotionally mature going through this. Here are some tips'. It was like a cheerleader on my side, like I was right and he was wrong."" Overall, she says it was ""useful"" but described the language as ""very much like therapy speak, using words like 'boundaries'"". ""All I took from it was it reminded me to be OK to do it on my terms, but I didn't take it too literally."" Rachel is not alone in turning to AI for advice in dealing with relationships. According to research by the online dating firm Match , almost half of Generation Z Americans (those born between 1997 and 2012) said they have used LLMs like ChatGPT for dating advice, that's more than any other generation. People are turning to AI to help craft breakup messages, to dissect conversations they're having with people they're dating, and to resolve problems in relationships. Anastasia Jobson Using AI might be a tactic to avoid difficult feelings says Dr Suglani Dr Lalitaa Suglani, psychologist and relationship expert, says AI can be a useful tool, especially for people who feel overwhelmed or unsure when it comes to communication in relationships. It may help them to craft a text, process a confusing message or source a second opinion, which can offer a moment of pause instead of being reactive, she says. ""In many ways it can function like a journalling prompt or reflective space, which can be supportive when used as a tool and not a replacement for connection,"" says Dr Suglani. However, she flags several concerns. ""LLMs are trained to be helpful and agreeable and repeat back what you are sharing, so they may subtly validate dysfunctional patterns or echo back assumptions, especially if the prompt is biased and the problem with this it can reinforce distorted narratives or avoidance tendencies."" For example, she says, using AI to write a breakup text might be a way to avoid the discomfort of the situation. That might contribute to avoidant behaviours, as the individual is not sitting with how they actually feel. Using AI might also inhibit their own development. ""If someone turns to an LLM every time they're unsure how to respond or feel emotionally exposed, they might start outsourcing their intuition, emotional language, and sense of relational self,"" says Dr Suglani. She also notes that AI messages can be emotionally sterile and make communication feel scripted, which can be unnerving to receive. Es Lee Not everyone can talk to friends and family about relationships says Es Lee Despite the challenges, services are springing up to serve the market for relationship advice. Mei is a free AI generated service. Trained using Open AI, the service responds to relationship dilemmas with conversational-like responses. ""The idea is to allow people to instantly seek help to navigate relationships because not everyone can talk to friends or family for fear of judgment,"" says New York-based founder Es Lee. He says more than half of the issues brought up on the AI tool concern sex, a subject that many may not wish to discuss with friends or a therapist, Mr Lee says. ""People are only using AI as existing services are lacking,"" he says. Another common use is how to reword a message or how to fix an issue in a relationship. ""It's like people need AI to validate it [the problem]."" When giving relationship advice, issues of safety could come up. A human counsellor would know when to intervene and protect a client from a potentially harmful situation. Would a relationship app provide the same guardrails? Mr Lee recognises the concern over safety. ""I think the stakes are higher with AI because it can connect with us on a personal level the way no other technology has."" But he says Mei has ""guardrails"" built into the AI. ""We welcome professionals and organisations to partner with us and take an active role in molding our AI products,"" he says. OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT says that its latest model has shown improvements in areas like avoiding unhealthy levels of emotional reliance and sycophancy. In a statement the company said: ""People sometimes turn to ChatGPT in sensitive moments, so we want to make sure it responds appropriately, guided by experts.  This includes directing people to professional help when appropriate, strengthening our safeguards in how our models respond to sensitive requests and nudging for breaks during long sessions."" Another area of concern is privacy. Such apps could potentially collect very sensitive data, which could be devastating if exposed by hackers. Mr Lee says ""at every fork in the road on how we handle user privacy, we choose the one that preserves privacy and collects only what we need to provide the best service."" As part of that policy, he says that Mei does not ask for information that would identify an individual, other than an email address. Mr Lee also says conversations are saved temporarily for quality assurance but discarded after 30 days. ""They are not currently saved permanently to any database."" Some people are using AI in combination with a human therapist. When Corinne (not her real name) was looking to end a relationship late last year, she started to turn to ChatGPT for advice on how to deal with it. London-based Corinne says she was inspired to turn to AI after hearing her housemate talk positively about using it for dating advice, including how to break up with someone. She said she would ask it to respond to her questions in the same style as popular relationship expert Jillian Turecki or holistic psychologist Dr Nicole LePera, both very popular on social media. When she started dating again at the start of the year she turned to it again, again asking for advice in the style of her favourite relationship experts. ""Around January I had been on a date with a guy and I didn't find him physically attractive but we get on really well so I asked it if it was worth going on another date. I knew they would say yes as I read their books but it was nice to have the advice tailored to my scenario."" Corinne, who has a therapist, says the discussions with her therapist delve more into childhood than the questions she raises with ChatGPT over dating or relationship queries. She says that she treats AI advice with ""a bit of distance"". ""I can imagine people ending relationships and perhaps having conversations they shouldn't be having yet [with their partner] as ChatGPT just repeats back what it thinks you want to hear. ""It's good in life's stressful moments. And when a friend isn't around. It calms me down.""

a06499c83bbb,The bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillers,,"The bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillers Zoe Corbyn Technology Reporter, San Francisco Getty Images E. coli has been used in many discoveries in genetics and molecular biology Earlier this year an extraordinary new way of using waste plastic made headlines. A common bacterium was genetically engineered to eat a plastic-derived molecule and then digest it to produce the everyday painkiller , paracetamol. The microbe used by Stephen Wallace, professor of chemical biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, was Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. The rod-shaped bacterium is found in the intestines of humans and animals, and you might be more familiar with it as an unpleasant bug that can make us ill . Prof Wallace chose it automatically because certain strains of E. coli that aren't pathogenic are used extensively in biotechnology and engineering biology laboratories to test whether something might work. E. coli is the field's main ""workhorse"" says Prof Wallace, who has also genetically engineered it in the lab to turn plastic waste into vanilla flavour and fatberg waste from sewers into perfume. ""If you want to prove something is possible with biology, E.coli is a natural first stage,"" he says. The microbe's use isn't just confined to the lab. Industrially, vats of genetically engineered E. coli act like living factories producing a variety of products from pharmaceuticals like insulin, vital for diabetes management, to various platform chemicals used to make fuels and solvents. University of Edinburgh Prof Wallace has engineered E.coli to produce vanilla flavour and perfume But how did E. coli come to be such a mainstay of biotechnology, why is it so useful and what might its future hold? E. coli's dominance stems from its role as a model organism for understanding general biological principles, says Thomas Silhavy, a professor of molecular biologist at Princeton University, who has been performing studies in the bacterium for about 50 years and has documented its history . Other familiar model organisms include mice, fruit flies and baker's yeast. Yeast, like E. coli, has also become an invaluable tool in biotechnology, both in the lab and industrially – but it has a more complex cell structure and different applications. E. coli was first isolated in 1885 by a German paediatrician, Theodor Escherich, studying infant gut microbes. Fast growing and easy to work with, scientists began to use it to study basic bacterial biology. Then in the 1940s, ""serendipity"" catapulted it into the big time, says Prof Silhavy. A non-pathogenic E. coli strain (K-12) was used to demonstrate bacteria did not just divide, but could undergo 'bacterial sex' where they share and recombine genes to gain new traits. It was a landmark discovery and E. coli became the ""very favourite organism of everybody"", he says. It saw E. coli go on to play a central role in many more discoveries and milestones in genetics and molecular biology. It was used to help decipher the genetic code, and in the 1970s it became the first organism to be genetically engineered when foreign DNA was inserted into it – laying the foundation for modern biotechnology. Getty Images E. coli is fast growing and easy to work with It also solved a problem with insulin production. Insulin from cattle and pigs had been used to treat diabetes, but caused allergic reactions in some patients. But in 1978 the first synthetic human insulin was produced using E. coli, a huge breakthrough. In 1997, it became one of the first organisms to have its entire genome sequenced, making it easier to understand and manipulate. Adam Feist, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who evolves microbes for industrial applications, says he appreciates E. coli for its many useful features. Beyond the vast knowledge accumulated about its genetics and the tools that make it easy to engineer, the bacterium grows quickly and predictably on a wide variety of substrates. It isn't ""finicky"" like some, can be frozen and revived without trouble, and is unusually good at hosting foreign DNA. ""The more I work with more microorganisms, the more I appreciate just how robust E. coli is,"" he says. Cynthia Collins is a senior director at Ginkgo Bioworks, a company that helps firms develop their biotech products, and has assisted them in using E. coli industrially. While the menu of organisms available for large-scale manufacturing is somewhat broader than it was a few decades ago – when E. coli was often the only choice – it can frequently still be a ""good choice"" depending on the product, says Dr Collins. (Even with the most intensive bioengineering, E. coli can't produce everything). ""It's very economical; you can pump out a lot,"" she says, noting that if the bacterium is producing something toxic to the cells, tolerance can often be engineered in. AFP via Getty Images E. coli is used in the production of insulin Yet there are some who wonder if E. coli's dominance might be stifling us from finding the very best biotech solutions for our problems. Paul Jensen, a microbiologist and engineer at the University of Michigan, studies bacteria that live in our mouths. He recently analysed just how understudied most other bacteria have been relative to E. coli. His point is while we are forging ahead with ever more extensive  engineering of E. coli to do remarkable things, there could be other microbes out there that do those things naturally – and better – that aren't getting a look in and we are missing out on benefitting from because they aren't being sought out or studied. Bioprospecting in landfills, for example, might turn up microbes that have started eating not only plastic but all sorts of other waste, he says.  And there could be bacteria out there that do things – like making cement or rubber – we haven't even imagined. Just the bacteria that live in our mouths outshine E. coli for acid tolerance he notes. ""We are just so deep with E. coli that we are not investigating enough,"" he says. There are some alternatives people are working on to increase options – including Vibrio natriegens (V. nat), which has begun to gain attention as a potential competitor to E. coli. V. nat was first isolated from a salt marsh in the US state of Georgia back in the 1960s but remained largely neglected in culture collections and freezers until the mid-2010s when it was recognized for its ultra-fast growth rate – twice that of E. coli – which could be a significant industrial advantage. It is also far more efficient at taking in foreign DNA, says Buz Barstow, a biological and environmental engineer at Cornell University, who is among those developing the organism, and says its capability compared to E. coli is like ""going from a horse to a car"". Driving Dr Barstow's V. nat focus is he wants to see microbes used to tackle big sustainability challenges – from producing jet fuel from carbon dioxide and green electricity to mining rare earth metals. ""Simply put, E. coli won't get us to any of these visions. V. natriegens might,"" he says. This year his lab spun out a company, Forage Evolution, which is working on tools to make it easier for researchers to engineer it in the lab. V. nat does offer attractive properties, Prof Feist acknowledges, but those genetic tools needed for broad use are, as yet, missing, and it has yet to prove itself at scale. ""E. coli is a tough thing to replace,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvm1kjxxvo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5330/live/ac20dee0-8c90-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-25T23:02:06.449000+00:00,df738b4d554c0493d944ed1f66b2ff0522eeeebb
a0b15877daa5,What's the big deal about AI data centres?,,"What's the big deal about AI data centres? Michael Dempsey Technology Reporter Getty Images AI services need a lot of computing power It's such a big number that it's hard to imagine. Worldwide, around $3tn (£2.2tn) will be spent on data centres that support AI between now and 2029. That estimate comes from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which adds that roughly half of that sum will go on construction costs, and half on the pricey hardware supporting the AI revolution. To put that number into perspective, that's roughly what the entire French economy was worth in 2024. In the UK alone, it's estimated that another 100 data centres will be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing. Some of those will be built for Microsoft which earlier this month announced $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector. Just what is it about AI data centres that's different from the traditional building containing ranks of computer servers that keeps our personal photos, social media accounts and work applications humming away? And are they worth this terrific spending spree? Data centres have been growing in size for years. A new term, hyperscale, was coined by the tech industry to describe sites where the power requirement runs into tens of megawatts, before gigawatts, a thousand times bigger than megawatts, came on the scene. But AI has supercharged this game. Most AI models rely on expensive computer chips from Nvidia to process tasks. Nvidia chips come in large cabinets costing around $4m each. And these cabinets hold the key to why AI data centres are different. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that train up AI software have to break language into every possible tiny element of meaning. That is only possible with a network of computers working in unison and in extremely close proximity. Why is proximity so important? Every metre of distance between two chips adds a nanosecond, one billionth of a second, to the processing time. It might not sound like much time, but when a warehouse full of computers is whirring away these microscopic delays pile up and dilute the performance needed for AI. The AI processing cabinets are jammed in together to eliminate this element of latency and create what the tech sector calls parallel processing, operating as one enormous computer. It all spells out density, a magic word in AI construction circles. Density eliminates the processing bottlenecks that regular data centres see from working with processors sitting several metres apart. Bloomberg via Getty Images Google is among the giants racing to build AI infrastructure However, those dense ranks of cabinets eat up gigawatts of power and LLM training produces spikes in that appetite for electricity. These spikes are equivalent to thousands of homes switching kettles on and off in unison every few seconds. This type of irregular demand on a local grid needs to be carefully managed. Daniel Bizo of data centre engineering consultancy The Uptime Institute analyses data centres for a living. ""Normal data centres are a steady hum in the background compared to the demand an AI workload makes on the grid."" Just like those synchronised kettles, sudden AI surges present what Mr Bizo calls a singular problem. ""The singular workload at this scale is unheard of,"" says Mr Bizo, ""it's such an extreme engineering challenge, it's like the Apollo programme."" Data centre operators are getting around the energy problem in various ways. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in the UK in the short term he was hoping that more gas turbines could be used ""off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid"". He said AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost effective sustainable energy. Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in energy projects, including a deal with Constellation Energy that will see nuclear power produced again on Three Mile Island. Google, owned by Alphabet, is also investing in nuclear power as part of a strategy to run on carbon-free energy by 2030 . Meanwhile Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, says it is already the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. Bloomberg via Getty Images Investment from Microsoft will see nuclear power restarting on Three Mile Island The data centre industry is acutely aware that legislators are keeping an eye on the downsides of AI factories with their intense energy use having a potential impact on local infrastructure and the environment. One of these environmental impacts includes a hefty supply of water to cool toiling chips. In the US state of Virginia, home to an expanding population of data centres that keep tech giants like Amazon and Google in business, a bill tying approval of new sites to water consumption figures is under consideration. Meanwhile a proposed AI factory in northern Lincolnshire in the UK has run into objections from Anglian Water, which is responsible for keeping taps on in the area of the proposed site. Anglian Water points out that it is not obliged to supply water for non-domestic use and suggests recycled water from the final stage of effluent treatment as a coolant rather than drinking water. Given the practical problems and enormous costs AI data centres face, is the whole movement really one big bubble? One speaker at recent data centre conference coined the term ""bragawatts"" to describe how the industry is talking up the scale of proposed AI sites. Zahl Limbuwala is a data centre specialist at tech investment advisors DTCP. He acknowledges big questions around the future of AI data centre spending. ""The current trajectory is very difficult to believe. There has certainly been a lot of bragging going on. But investment has to deliver a return or the market will correct itself."" Bearing these cautions in mind, he still believes AI merits a special place in investment terms. ""AI will have more impact than previous technologies, including the internet. So it's feasible we'll need all those gigawatts."" He notes that bragging apart, AI data centres ""are the real estate of the tech world."" Speculative tech bubbles such as the dotcom boom of the 1990s lacked a bricks and mortar base. AI data centres are very solid. But the spending boom behind them cannot last forever.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone. Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads. The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation. At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes."" ""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor. The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark. Beta Technologies Alia has a range of 400km Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car. The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport. Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year. ""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot. ""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective."" Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation. It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago. With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B. But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation. Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold . Airbus Development of the CityAirbus is on hold Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel. They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University. For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says. Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology. Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology. Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace. It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United. The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States. If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler. Heart Aerospace Heart plans a hybrid plane that can switch between batteries and jet fuel For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup. ""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers. ""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained. ""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines."" The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims. ""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan. ""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach. Heart isn't alone in this field. US-based aerospace startup Electra expects its nine-seater hybrid plane to take flight by 2029, running on a combination of jet fuel and electric power. Beta Technologies is also pursuing hybrid aircraft for defence and civilian purposes. Its first model was built in 2023, and later this year it plans to produce a plane that is not only hybrid but autonomous. ""Are we excited about hybrid? 100%,"" says Mr Hall. ""It's a way to get longer ranges, today, and you still get a lot of the environmental benefit."" A fully electric foundation is necessary first argues Mr Hall, ""you then layer on hybrid technology"". Hybrid systems have lower emissions than conventional aircraft and the electric motors would enable quieter take off and landing in urban areas. It's still not clear what the future of aviation will look like. Greener fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have attracted investment, along with hydrogen-based systems. All will have to prove their commercial viability and safety, and much work needs to be done. ""This is a really challenging thing to do, electrifying aviation and removing the carbon,"" said Mr Stabler.

5cdcc17eb032,AI challenges the dominance of Google search,,"AI challenges the dominance of Google search Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Anja-Sara Lahady AI has become an assistant for Anja-Sara Lahady Like most people, when Anja-Sara Lahady used to check or research anything online, she would always turn to Google. But since the rise of AI, the lawyer and legal technology consultant says her preferences have changed - she now turns to large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""For example, I'll ask it how I should decorate my room, or what outfit I should wear,"" says Ms Lahady, who lives in Montreal, Canada. ""Or, I have three things in the fridge, what should I make? I don't want to spend 30 minutes thinking about these admin tasks. These aren't my expertise; they make me more fatigued."" Ms Lahady says her usage of LLMs overtook Google Search in the past year when they became more powerful for what she needed. ""I've always been an early adopter… and in the past year have started using ChatGPT for just about everything. It's become a second assistant."" While she says she won't use LLMs for legal tasks - ""anything that needs legal reasoning"" -  she uses it in a professional capacity for any work that she describes as ""low risk"", for example, drafting an email. ""I also use it to help write code or find the best accounting software for my business."" Ms Lahady is not alone. A growing number are heading straight for LLMs, such as ChatGPT, for recommendations and to answer everyday questions. ChatGPT attracts more than 800 million weekly active users, up from 400 million in February 2025, according to Demandsage, a data and research firm. Traditional search engines like Google and Microsoft's Bing still dominate the market for search. But LLMs are growing fast. According to research firm Datos, in July 5.99% of search on desktop browsers went to LLMs, that's more than double the figure from a year earlier. Getty Images ChatGPT attracts around 800 million weekly users Professor Feng Li, associate dean for research and innovation at Bayes Business School in London, says people are using LLMs because they lower the ""cognitive load"" - the amount of mental effort required to process and act on information – compared to search. ""Instead of juggling 10 links with search, you get a brief synthesis that you can edit and iterate in plain English,"" he says. ""LLMs are particularly useful for summarising long documents, first-pass drafting, coding snippets, and 'what-if' exploration."" However, he says outputs still require verification before use, as hallucinations and factual errors remain common. While the use of AI might have exploded, Google denies that it is at the expense of its search engine. It says overall queries and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year and its new AI tools significantly contributed to this increase in usage. Those new tools include AI Mode, which allows users to ask more conversational questions and receive more tailored responses in return. That followed the rollout of AI Overviews, which produces summaries of queries at the top of the search page. While Google plays down the impact of LLMs on its search business, an indication of the affect came in May during testimony in an antitrust trial bought by the US Department of Justice against Google. A top Apple executive said that the number of Google searches on Apple devices, via its browser Safari, fell for the first time in more than 20 years. Nevertheless, Prof Li doesn't believe there will be a replacement of search but a hybrid model will exist. ""LLM usage is growing, but so far it remains a minority behaviour compared with traditional search. It is likely to continue to grow but stabilise somewhere, when people primarily use LLMs for some tasks and search for others such as transactions like shopping and making bookings, and verification purposes."" Getty Images Apple says Google searches on Apple devices via the Safari browser are falling As a result of the rise of LLMs, companies are having to change their marketing strategies. They need to understand ""which sources the model considers authoritative within their category,"" says Leila Seith Hassan, chief data officer at digital marketing agency Digitas UK. ""For example, in UK beauty we saw news outlets and review sites like Vogue and Sephora referenced heavily, whereas in the US there was more emphasis on content from brands' own websites."" She says that LLMs place more trust in official websites, press releases, established media, and recognised industry rankings than in social media posts. And that could be important, as Ms Seith Hassan says there are signs that people who have used AI to search for a product, are more likely to buy. ""Referrals coming directly from LLMs often appear to be higher quality, with people are more likely to convert to sales."" There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that people are turning to LLMs when searching for products. Hannah Cooke, head of client strategy at media and influencer agency Charlie Oscar, says she started using LLMs in a ""more serious and strategic way"" about 18 months ago. She mainly uses ChatGPT but has experimented with Google Gemini to personally and professionally streamline her work and life. Ms Cooke, who lives in London, says rather than turning to Google, she will ask ChatGPT for personalised skincare recommendations for her skin type. ""There's fewer websites I need to go through,"" she says of the benefits. And it's the same with travel planning. ""ChatGPT is much easier to find answers and recommendations,"" she says. ""For example, I used ChatGPT to research ahead of a recent visit to Japan. I asked it to plan two weeks travelling and find me restaurants with vegetarian dishes. It saved [me] hours of research.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dx9qy1eeno,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9217/live/d4032390-881d-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,2025-09-15T23:03:20.927000+00:00,e449596b9278c2847735ceafba4bb2e001ea3adf
50ff1a7018e1,Publishers fear AI summaries are hitting online traffic,,"Publishers fear AI summaries are hitting online traffic Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Getty Images Newspapers are banking on online revenue to replace falling circulation When actress Sorcha Cusack left the BBC drama Father Brown in January, it made headlines, including for the newspapers owned by Reach, among them The Mirror, and the Daily Express. But the story did not generate the traction the Reach newspapers would have expected a year ago, or even at the start of the year. Reach put this down to AI Overviews (AIO) – the AI summary at the top of the Google results page. Instead of clicking through to the story on a Reach newspaper site, readers were happy with the AI overview. The feature is a concern for newspapers and other media publishers, who have already seen much of their advertising revenue siphoned off by social media. In a tough market, readers coming via Google search is a valuable source of traffic. ""A major worry, backed by some individual datapoints, has been that AI overviews would lead to fewer people clicking through to the content behind them, with negative knock-on effects for publishers,"" says Dr Felix Simon, research fellow in AI and news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. He points out that it's hard to know the full effect of AI overviews, without independent access to Google's, or publishers', internal data on click-through rates. DMG Media, owner of MailOnline, Metro and other outlets, said AIO resulted in a fall in click-through-rates by as much as 89%, in a statement to the Competition and Markets Authority made in July. It means publishers are not being fairly rewarded for their work, says David Higgerson, chief digital publisher at Reach. ""Publishers provide the accurate, timely, trustworthy content that basically fuels Google, and in return we get a click… that hopefully we can monetise to our subscription service. ""Now with Google Overviews it's reducing the need for somebody to click through to us in the first place, but for no financial benefit for the publisher."" ""It's another example of the distributor of information not being the creator of information but taking all the financial reward for it."" There is also concern over Google's new tool called AI Mode , which shows search results in a conversational style with far fewer links than traditional search. ""If Google flips onto full AI Mode, and there is a big uptake in that…that [will be] completely quite devastating for the industry,"" says Mr Higgerson. Getty Images The Daily Mail has one of the UK's biggest online news operations ""We are definitely moving into the era of lower clicks and lower referral traffic for publishers,"" says Stuart Forrest, global director of SEO digital publishing at Bauer Media. ""For most of the last decade Google has introduced more and more features into the SERP [Search Engine Results Page], which reduces the need for consumers to visit a website. That is the challenge that we as a sector face."" Mr Forrest says he hasn't noticed a drop in traffic across Bauer's sites, which include brands Grazia and Empire, as a result of the overview feature. But that could change. ""I absolutely think that as time goes on, as consumers get used to these panels, it's without doubt going to be a challenge. We are absolutely behaving as if we have to respond to that threat."" In its defence, a Google spokesperson said: ""More than any other company, Google prioritises sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day. In an August blog post , Google's head of search Liz Reid said the volume of clicks from Google search to websites had been ""relatively stable"" year-over-year. She also said the number of quality of clicks had improved slightly compared to a year ago - quality clicks are when a user does not immediately click back from the link. ""With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked,"" she said in the blog. Publishers are trying to work out how to appear in Google summaries Some in the publishing industry are turning to the courts for redress. In July, a group of organisations including the Independent Publishers Alliance, tech justice non-profit Foxglove, and the campaign group Movement for an Open Web filed a legal complaint to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority alleging that Google AI Overviews is using publishers' content at a cost to the newspapers. It is asking the CMA to introduce interim measures to prevent Google from ""misusing"" publisher content in AI-generated responses. In the meantime publishers are trying to understand how to feature in AIO and hopeful win some click-throughs. ""Google doesn't give us a manual on how to do it. We have to run tests and optimise copy in a way that doesn't damage the primary purpose of the content, which is to satisfy a reader's desire for information,"" explains Mr Higgerson. ""We need to make sure that it's us being cited and not our rivals,"" says Mr Forrest. ""Things like writing good quality content… it's amazing the number of publishers that just give up on that."" Like other publishers, Reach is looking at other ways to build traffic to its news platforms. ""We need to go and find where audiences are elsewhere and build relationships with them there. We've got millions of people who receive our alerts on WhatsApp,"" Mr Higgerson says. ""We've built newsletters. It's all about giving people what they want when they're on our website and our brand, so the next time they're looking, hopefully they aren't going to a third party to get to us.""

a31fecda2464,The green steel firms looking to revive US steelmaking,,"The green steel firms looking to revive US steelmaking Chris Baraniuk Technology Reporter Boston Metal Making steel using electricity is less carbon intensive than traditional methods A day care centre for children, a gym, a tax advisor – and a mini experimental steel plant. These businesses are among those that make up a small retail and industrial estate in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts. ""People are dropping off their kids. That kind of shows you an extreme example of what the future of steel looks like,"" says Adam Rauwerdink, vice president of business development at US-based green steel start-up, Boston Metal. ""You can be making steel and sharing a parking lot with a daycare."" Boston Metal has come up with a way of using electricity to remove oxides and other contaminants from iron ore, which is the substance you have to mine from the Earth before you can make new steel. The process involves distributing the ore within an electrolyte and then using electricity to heat this mixture to 1,600C. Molten iron then separates from impurities and can be tapped off. Traditionally, extracting that all-important iron from ores requires blast furnaces that run on fossil fuels. But the iron and steel industry are responsible for 11% of global emissions – a huge amount, equivalent to all the world's private cars and vans – and so now a race is on to find greener ways of producing these important metals. US companies are, arguably, at the forefront. Steelmaking in the US is already greener than in many countries, thanks to the popularity of electric arc furnaces there. These furnaces use electricity, not heat from burning fossil fuels, to melt scrap steel – for example – and recycle it. Plus, a handful of emerging start-ups such as Boston Metal say they can go one better and use electricity for the iron-making process, a crucial step in making brand new, or virgin, steel. However, the Trump administration has taken a less than enthusiastic stance towards renewable energy and decarbonisation projects. It remains to be seen whether these new start-ups will make a big, molten splash in the steel industry any time soon. Switching from traditional blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces can lower carbon emissions per tonne of steel produced from 2.32 tonnes of CO2 to 0.67 tonnes of CO2. For iron-making, some plants could use green hydrogen – made using electricity from 100% renewable sources – says Simon Nicholas, lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. But switching iron and steel-making plants over to green hydrogen hasn't gone as smoothly as some had expected. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs, a major US steel producer, appeared to back away from its plans to build a $500m (£375m) hydrogen-powered steel plant in Ohio. The BBC has contacted Cleveland-Cliffs for comment. ""We're seeing projects cancelled, proponents pulling out of projects all over the place,"" says Mr Nicholas, of green hydrogen initiatives, specifically. Bloomberg via Getty Images Electric arc furnaces melt scrap to make new rolls of steel Plus, there is a limit to how much steel-making can rely on electric arc furnaces since they currently largely rely on a supply of scrap steel. A relatively low supply of scrap steel in China, versus demand, has slowed the rollout of electric arc furnaces there, according to some analyses . These headaches would suggest that there is a niche for companies developing alternative ways of making iron and steel. Boston Metal is one. ""It looks a lot like how we make iron and steel today – it's a lot easier to conceive how that would get to scale [as a result],"" says Paul Kempler, an expert in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering at the University of Oregon. However, he notes that there are still challenges in ensuring that electrolysis systems like this don't corrode too quickly over time. Boston Metal says it hopes to have its first demonstration-scale steel plant operational by 2028. Electra Steel collected on a plate at Electra's plant in Colorado Separately, the US firm Electra is taking a different approach to producing highly purified iron from ores. Unlike Boston Metal, Electra's process runs at a relatively low temperature, around 60-100C. First, iron ore is dissolved into an acidic solution and then an electrical charge causes the iron to collect onto metal plates. This is similar to the process currently used for making sheets of copper and zinc today. ""These plates are extracted automatically out of the solution and the iron is harvested,"" says Sandeep Nijhawan, co-founder and chief executive. A demonstration plant in Colorado, which could produce 500 tonnes of iron annually, is currently set to open next year. Initially, iron produced in this manner would cost more than iron made using traditional techniques. But that ""green premium"" could fall away should the company be able to scale sufficiently, says Mr Nijhawan. Bloomberg via Getty Images A plentiful supply of renewable energy is crucial for greening steel production Mr Nicholas says that emerging technologies such as this are hopeful, but one challenge they face is in breaking into the market in a big way within just a few years, since the need to slash emissions and curb climate change is become more and more urgent: ""We're running short of time for addressing carbon emissions."" Companies such as Electra and Boston Metal offer a completely different vision of the steel-making industry but they won't get far without further investment – and a market that appreciates what they are doing. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel imports to the US are supposedly designed to protect the domestic steel industry – and yet they risk raising the cost of steel substantially for US customers. I ask whether Dr Rauwerdink, for one, is happy to see this move, or not. ""We're quite happy to see the strong focus on critical metals,"" he says, arguing the tariffs are ""beneficial"" for Boston Metal. Though he acknowledges that US government's attitude towards renewable electricity, which Boston Metal says it want to prioritise as an energy source, has changed lately. And, globally, keeping the cost of renewable energy low is important for any firm hoping to electrify industries previously dominated by fossil fuels. ""The industry has growing pains there, for sure,"" he says.

He says he knew getting into the tech workforce would be a challenge, but ""I thought it would be a little easier"". Even when ""junior"" roles were advertised, they often demanded two or more years professional experience, Mr Hart says. ""It's not realistic, and it's just discouraging the good candidates from even trying."" To him it seems clear that potential employers are using AI tools to automate the simpler parts of coder's work, tasks which would traditionally allow newcomers to build up experience. While companies undoubtedly benefit from using AI in some parts of their operations, says Mr Hart, ""I don't think replacing developers entirely with AI is sustainable."" ChatGPT, and other coding tools, are being blamed for a collapse in tech job openings, particularly for younger software developers and engineers. A report by the UK's National Foundation for Education Research showed a 50% decline in tech job adverts between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with entry level roles particularly affected. The report cited the ""anticipated impact of artificial intelligence"" as one of the factors behind this. At the same time, software developers have widely adopted AI code tools, while simultaneously expressing distrust in their output. Research by Stack Overflow , a software knowledge platform, shows almost half use AI tools daily, despite just one third actually trusting the output of such tools. Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO of Stack Overflow, says it's ""a tricky time to graduate"". More broadly, he says, its research shows developers are choosing to stay put, despite many expressing dissatisfaction with their work. ""People are probably running for safety a little bit."" All of this means young technologists are finding it harder to get that critical first job. Stack Overflow ""It's a tricky time to graduate,"" says Prashanth Chandrasekar The stress of finding a job is also being raised by the use of AI in the job application process. Mr Hart came across one highly automated application process which had eight stages, the first of which was to answer 20 exam-style questions about himself. Such exercises can take up hours of time. Friends had been asked to record and upload answers to interview style questions. ""And then that's just reviewed by AI and a computer makes the decision. It just feels like you don't get that respect of at least being rejected by a human,"" he says. Colin, who didn't want his full name to be used, studied computer science at university, graduating in 2024. He spent almost a year working through the recruitment process for one large company – only to be ultimately unsuccessful. Even smaller firms often use AI to screen applications, he says, meaning CVs have to structured to be ""AI friendly"". Colin would then find he was being interviewed by people ""who have clearly not read my CV"". Both Mr Hart and Colin said they knew the senior roles were still out there. But, they wondered, who will fill them if younger developers like them were unable to secure jobs. InfluxData The pipeline of coders could dry up says Paul Dix Paul Dix, CTO and co-founder at California-based database firm, InfluxData says in any economic downturn or disruption, junior software developers were the ones who got hit hardest. But he says, ""If nobody's hiring younger developers, then you're going to arrive at this point where you don't have senior developers either, because you've completely killed your pipeline."" More positively says Rajiv Ramaswami, CEO of US enterprise cloud firm Nutanix, ""Some of these younger folks coming out of college actually have more experience using AI tooling compared to traditional ways of programming."" Ramaswami adds: ""I find the market for talent to be the best we've seen in several years."" Mr Chandrasekar says the industry had always had an ""apprenticeship"" type model, with a pipeline of young people coming in and working with senior developers. And, he suggests, executives and companies that had invested heavily in AI tech are under pressure to show some return on that investment. Even if that was by simply cutting back on hiring. Stack Overflow's research also found that while 64% of developers perceived AI as a threat to their jobs, this was four percentage points down on the previous year. ""They've now seen some of the limitations, where you need humans in the loop,"" Mr Chandrasekar notes. Previous tech disruptions had sparked fears that both senior or junior jobs would disappear, says Mr Chandrasekar. But invariably they result in more jobs as people uncover new problems and challenges. ""There's going to be an insatiable appetite for technologists and developers to go and build those things to help solve those problems."" But that spike in demand might not come in time for some of today's graduates. Mr Hart has  secured a role as a security engineer at UK-based cybersecurity firm Threatspike, which he gained through a very human centred job process. Meanwhile, Colin has turned his back on tech altogether and is considering a career in the police.

8da9624fb8dc,How to destroy harmful 'forever chemicals',,"How to destroy harmful 'forever chemicals' Zoe Corbyn Technology Reporter, San Francisco 374Water 374Water can purge PFAS from water and sludge ""There's a lot of destruction that needs to be done,"" sums up Parker Bovée of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm. He is referring to PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances), also known as ""forever chemicals"". These man-made chemicals can be found in items such as waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks and food packaging. They are used for their grease and water repellence, but do not degrade quickly and have been linked to health issues such as higher risks of certain cancers and reproductive problems. The extraordinarily strong carbon-fluorine bonds they contain gives them the ability to persist for decades or even centuries in nature. PFAS can be detected and removed from water and soil and then concentrated into smaller volumes of high strength waste. But what to do with that waste? Currently, concentrated PFAS waste is either put in long-term storage which is expensive, or incinerated (often incompletely, leading to toxic emissions), or sent to landfills for hazardous waste. But now clean-tech companies are bringing techniques to market that can destroy them. These are being tested in small-scale pilot projects with potential customers including some industrial manufacturers, municipal wastewater treatment plants and even the US military. There's a ""large and growing"" market opportunity for PFAS destruction companies notes Mr Bovée. While it is mostly currently centred in the US, others are dipping their toes, he says. In the UK, funding for water companies to look into PFAS destruction has been provided by water regulator Ofwat, with Severn Trent Water leading a project to examine the potential technologies and suppliers. One factor driving the market forward in the US is legal risk. Thousands of lawsuits claiming PFAS-related contamination and harm have been filed with some large chemical manufacturers, notably 3M, having already paid out billions in class-action settlements. Regulation is also beginning to tighten worldwide. Legal limits for two PFAS in drinking water are now scheduled to take effect in the US in 2031. PFAS remains a bipartisan issue, says Mr Bovée, and many expect that future US regulation will expand beyond drinking water to cover industrial discharge and other sources. The EU also has legal limits for PFAS in drinking water, which member states must begin enforcing from next year. Axine Water Technologies Axine's system is already in use at an auto parts company There are a variety of technologies for destroying PFAS – each with their own advantages and limitations. According to Mr Bovée, one technology that is almost commercially ready is electrochemical oxidation (EO) technology. Electrodes are placed in water contaminated by PFAS and a current is passed through, resulting in the chemicals' breakdown. While energy intensive, it doesn't require high temperature or pressure, and is easy to operate and integrate into existing treatment systems for concentrating PFAS, says Mark Ralph, CEO of Canadian-based start-up Axine Water Technologies. Last year, following a successful pilot project, it sold its first commercial-scale unit to a Michigan-based producer of automotive components. It is now up and running and the customer is planning to purchase additional systems for other sites. 374Water A waste water facility in Orlando is testing 374Water's treatment system Another technology not far behind is Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). It relies on heating and pressurising water to such a high degree that it enters a new state of matter: a so-called supercritical state. When the PFAS waste stream is introduced, it breaks the carbon-fluorine bonds. One advantage is that it can process both solid and liquid PFAS waste, says Chris Gannon, CEO of North Carolina-based 374Water. He says his technology can even destroy PFAS in plastics if they are ground up. It can be expensive to buy and maintain – the process is so intense it requires a complex reactor and regular cleaning. But it can be more cost effective if the PFAS is first concentrated before it enters the process. Currently the City of Orlando in Florida is testing 374Water's technology at its largest wastewater treatment plant. The City is trying to get ahead of the curve, explains Alan Oyler, its special projects manager for public works. Levels of PFAS in sewage sludge aren't currently regulated, but he expects them to be in the future. So far, Mr Oyler is pleased with the destruction capability he has seen, but is also waiting to see how reliable the system is. The scale of 374Water's current technology is small: it can handle just a fraction of the tonnes of wet sludge the facility produces daily. But the company is in the process of scaling up, and Mr Oyler imagines in a few years it will be able to handle all the facility's material ""ready for when the regulations require"". Other technologies on their way to being commercially ready include hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT), which uses high temperature, high pressure, and an alkaline chemical to destroy PFAS; and plasma-based technology, which involves making an ionized gas (called a plasma) to attack and degrade the PFAS molecules. Aquagga Aquagga destroyed PFAS in a fire-fighting foam mixture Yet there is one potential issue with the technologies now coming through, says Jay Meegoda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology: nasty PFAS degradation byproducts. For example, in the case of EO, highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride vapor. Each needs a ""complete study"" accounting for all their inputs and outputs, he says. The companies have claimed they either don't produce PFAS degradation products or deal with them adequately. One important partner for many of the PFAS destruction companies in testing their technologies in the real world has been the US Department of Defence (DOD). PFAS contamination at US military sites is a big, below-the-radar problem. It stems particularly from the use of older formulations of firefighting foam, used for example during training exercises or emergencies, but other routes too such as the cleaning of military equipment. More than 700 sites are known or suspected to be contaminated, posing a threat to surrounding communities. A judge recently cleared the way for PFAS contamination and harm lawsuits against the military to proceed. Clean up efforts are where the destruction companies could come in, and projects have been undertaken or are under way at various sites to assess the performance and cost effectiveness of many of their solutions. One start-up, Aquagga, which specialises in HALT technology, recently completed a demonstration project for the DOD which involved destroying a firefighting foam mixture amongst other concentrated PFAS-containing liquids. Immense volumes of the foam are currently stockpiled in all sorts of places, not just at military sites. Like others, Aquagga sees a big opportunity over the next few years for both destroying the foam and remediating the environmental damage associated with its use. And outside the military, there's a tantalizing new PFAS waste stream on the horizon. The US is actively expanding domestic computer chip manufacturing – a process that uses PFAS in massive amounts. ""We can destroy that,"" says Mr Gannon, of 374Water.

2ddf47594d31,Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV?,,"Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV? Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter XYZ Films Swedish movie Watch the Skies was dubbed into English using AI Finding international films that might appeal to the US market is an important part of the work of XYZ Films. Maxime Cottray is the chief operating officer at the Los Angeles-based independent studio. He says the US market has always been tough for foreign language films. ""It's been limited to coastal New York viewers through art house films,"" he says. It's partly a language problem. ""America is not a culture which has grown up with subtitles or dubbing like Europe has,"" he points out. But that language hurdle might be easier to clear with a new AI-driven dubbing system. The audio and video of a recent film, Watch the Skies, a Swedish sci-fi film, was fed into a digital tool called DeepEditor. It manipulates the video to make it look like actors are genuinely speaking the language the film is made into. ""The first time I saw the results of the tech two years ago I thought it was good, but having seen the latest cut, it's amazing. I'm convinced that if the average person if saw it, they wouldn't notice it - they'd assume they were speaking whatever language that is,"" says Mr Cottray. The English version of Watch The Skies was released in 110 AMC Theatres across the US in May. ""To contextualise this result, if the film were not dubbed into English, the film would never have made it into US cinemas in the first place,"" says Mr Cottray. ""US audiences were able to see a Swedish independent film that otherwise only a very niche audience would have otherwise seen."" He says that AMC plans to run more releases like this. Flawless DeepEditor can translate a performance into a different language DeepEditor was developed by Flawless, which is headquartered in Soho, London. Writer and director Scott Mann founded the company in 2020, having worked on films including Heist, The Tournament and Final Score. He felt that traditional dubbing techniques for the international versions of his films didn't quite match the emotional impact of the originals. ""When I worked on Heist in 2014, with a brilliant cast including Robert De Niro, and then I saw that movie translated to a different language, that's when I first realised that no wonder the movies and TV don't travel well, because the old world of dubbing really kind of changes everything about the film,"" says Mr Mann, now based in Los Angeles. ""It's all out of sync, and it's performed differently. And from a purist filmmaking perspective, a very much lower grade product is being seen by the rest of the world."" Flawless Scott Mann founded Flawless in 2020 Flawless developed its own technology for identifying and modifying faces, based on a method first presented in a research paper in 2018. ""DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection [such as facial features] and 3D face tracking to understand the actor's appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot,"" says Mr Mann. The tech can preserve actors' original performances across languages, without reshoots or re-recordings, reducing costs and time, he says. According to him, Watch the Skies was the world's first fully visually-dubbed feature film. As well as giving an actor the appearance of speaking another language, DeepEditor can also transfer a better performance from one take into another, or swap a new line of dialogue, while keeping the original performance with its emotional content intact. Thanks to the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple, the global film dubbing market is set to increase from US$4bn (£3bn) in 2024 to $7.6bn by 2033, according to a report by Business Research Insights. Mr Mann won't say how much the tech costs but says it varies per project. ""I'd say it works out at about a tenth of the cost of shooting it or changing it any other way."" His customers include ""pretty much all the really big streamers"". Mr Mann believes the technology will enable films to be seen by a wider audience. ""There is an enormous amount of incredible kind of cinema and TV out there that is just never seen by English speaking folks, because many don't want to watch it with dubbing and subtitles,"" says Mr Mann. The tech isn't here to replace actors, says Mann, who says voice actors are used rather than being replaced with synthetic voices. ""What we found is that if you make the tools for the actual creatives and the artists themselves, that's the right way of doing it… they get kind of the power tools to do their art and that can feed into the finished product. That's the opposite of a lot of approaches that other tech companies have taken."" Natan Dvir Neta Alexander is concerned about a ""monolingual"" film culture However, Neta Alexander, assistant professor of film and media at Yale University, says that while the promise of wider distribution is tempting, using AI to reconfigure performances for non-native markets risks eroding the specificity and texture of language, culture, and gesture. ""If all foreign films are adapted to look and sound English, the audience's relationship with the foreign becomes increasingly mediated, synthetic, and sanitised,"" she says. ""This could discourage cross-cultural literacy and disincentivise support for subtitled or original-language screenings."" Meanwhile, she says, the displacement of subtitles, a key tool for language learners, immigrants, deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers and many others, raises concerns about accessibility. ""Closed captioning is not just a workaround; it's a method of preserving the integrity of both visual and auditory storytelling for diverse audiences,"" says Prof Alexander. Replacing this with automated mimicry suggests a disturbing turn toward commodified and monolingual film culture, she says. ""Rather than ask how to make foreign films easier for English-speaking audiences, we might better ask how to build audiences that are willing to meet diverse cinema on its own terms.""

fc9e35f6ba19,Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls,,"Economic woes dominate as Bolivia prepares to go to the polls Jane Chambers Business reporter, El Alto, Bolivia Getty Images Higher food and fuel prices have led to street protests across Bolivia this year As Bolivians prepare to vote in a general election, the country's deep economic woes are the central issue. Whoever becomes the nation's next president faces a very difficult job to try to sort out the mess. El Alto is Bolivia's second-largest city, home to 1.2 million people. And, at an elevation of 4,150m (13,615ft), it is the world's highest city with a population of more than 100,000. It's full of narrow streets with vendors trying to sell you everything from oranges to knock-off designer trainers. Standing on a pavement, car mechanic Josue Macias is enjoying an ice cream with his young son. He describes how Bolivia's sky-high inflation is affecting him and his family. The annual rate soared to 24% in June. ""Prices for everything are going up, but we are still earning the same,"" he says. ""We are just about getting by, but it's hard because food prices are rising all the time, things like meat, oil and eggs. They are double or triple what they used to be. ""We've had to tighten our belts. We don't go out to eat in restaurants anymore. Instead, I'm here on the street having an ice-cream with my son!"" Bolivia's inflation spike has been caused by a combination of factors. Falling natural gas production and therefore exports of this key foreign earner has led to a decline in overseas revenues. In turn, this has meant a shortage of US dollars, making it harder and more costly for the country to import petrol, diesel and food stuffs, leading to shortages and price hikes. It has led to street protests across the country. At some petrol stations across the country, lorry drivers often have to wait more than 24 hours to fill up. Taxi driver Gonzalo Rios is frustrated. As we drive along the pot-holed streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, he tells me about his struggles. ""Before it was easy to fill up with petrol. Now I must wait for around four to six hours at the gas pump to get some, and that's too much. It's such a waste of time. ""And the prices are so expensive,"" he adds. ""Now the money we earn doesn't cover our costs. But we can't put our fares up because if we do, we won't have any customers. It would be too expensive for them."" Car mechanic Josue Macias says he can afford to buy an ice cream but not go out for a proper meal For almost 20 years the Bolivian government kept fuel prices artificially low through subsidies. This started when the government of then President Evo Morales nationalised the country's hydrocarbon sector in 2006. But in 2023, state energy company YPFB said Bolivia was running out of domestically-produced natural gas, due to a lack of investment in new exploration. Without this gas to export, the Bolivian government is struggling to continue to find the funds to subsidise petrol and diesel. Last year it spent $2bn (£1.5bn) on such subsidies, according to a recent statement by a former minister of hydrocarbons and energy. Outgoing left-wing President Luis Arce, who is not seeking re-election on 17 August, blamed the Bolivian parliament for the fall in natural gas production, accusing MPs of blocking vital oversea loans. His opponents in turn blame him for the economic turmoil. The official exchange rate of Bolivia's currency, the bolivianos, is certainly not helping matters. Since 2011 the government has fixed the exchange rate at 6.96 bolivianos to one US dollar. But unofficially you can get 14 to 15 bolivianos per dollar. This has led to a thriving black market, especially of exports, from which the government misses out on tax revenue. Economist Gary Rodriguez, the general manager for the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade, explains: ""A product that costs seven bolivianos here in Bolivia can be sold for 15 bolivianos abroad,"" he says. ""The problem is that businesses would prefer to sell items on the [overseas] black market rather than here in Bolivia which leads to food and fuel shortages."" Getty Images Fuel shortages have caused queues at petrol stations across Bolivia Restrictions on the use of credit cards is another headache for Bolivia's business community. ""The problem with the credit cards is that all the banks have limits that are ridiculous,"" says Alessandra Guglielmi, who owns a food business called The Clean Spot. ""You can [only] spend around $35 a month over the internet with online purchases. $35 is nothing for a business."" She is concerned about her business going under. ""I am worried with food prices going up I can't afford to pay my staff a decent salary,"" says Ms Guglielmi. ""I am worried about the people not being able to afford to buy my products because I must put the prices up. ""And I am worried because my margins have gone down so it's very hard right now for me to keep a business."" Many people in Bolivia are hoping that a new government will be able to turn the country's fortunes around. Two right-wing candidates are currently ahead in the polls for the presidential race. Leading is Samuel Doria Medina of National Unity Front. He was previously the main shareholder of Bolivia's largest cement manufacturer. In second place is Jorge Quiroga of Freedom and Democracy. He has been president of Bolivia before, from 2001 to 2002. If no candidate gets more than half the votes on 17 August – which no-one is expected to achieve - then there will be a second round of voting on 19 October. Bolivian political scientist and analyst Franklin Pareja is sceptical that the next administration will be able to improve most people's lives. Franklin Pareja says it will be difficult for the new government to improve matters ""The population is assigning a change in government almost magical qualities, because they think that with a change of government we'll return to stability and prosperity,"" he says. ""And that's not going to happen. ""Bolivia will only feel the hard impact of the economic crisis with a new government, because it will make structural economic changes, which will be unpopular."" Mr Rodríguez is adamant that the Bolivian economy needs to be significantly altered. ""We need to change the model, because the current model, has too much emphasis on the state,"" he says. ""There are two actors, one the state sector and the other the private sector. The driver of development must be the citizen, the entrepreneur, and for that, the state must do what it's meant to do. In other words, good laws, good regulations, good institutions."" While polls suggest Bolivia's next administration is likely to be right-wing, such radical governmental and economic change, to significantly reduce the state's role, is not expected.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nn665g32o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a5e6/live/d4580680-76a7-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg,2025-08-13T23:29:33.362000+00:00,722dc32286ccf2e8c391ada62ebbf5bc9be90897
8e83e83a125d,How the US got left behind in the global electric car race,,"How the US got left behind in the global electric car race Getty Images You could be forgiven for thinking that electric cars might finally be gaining momentum in the US. After all, sales of battery cars topped 1.2 million last year, more than five times the number just four years earlier. Hybrid sales have jumped by a factor of three. Battery-powered cars accounted for 10% of overall sales in August - a new high, according to S&P Global Mobility. And in updates to investors this week, General Motors, Ford, Tesla and other companies all reported record electric sales over the past three months. This marked a bright spot in an industry wrestling with the fallout from still high interest rates and buyers on edge over inflation, tariffs and the wider economy. But analysts say the boom was caused by a dash to buy before the end of a government subsidy that helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,588) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. With that tax credit gone as of the end of September, carmakers are expecting momentum to shift into reverse. ""It's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,"" Ford chief executive Jim Farley said at an event on Tuesday. ""I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously,"" the chief financial officer of General Motors, Paul Jacobson, said at a conference last month, adding it would take time to see how quickly buyers would come back. Even with the recent gains, the US, the world's second biggest car market, stood out as a laggard in electric car sales compared to much of the rest of the world. In the UK, for example, sales of battery electric and hybrid cars made up nearly 30% of new sales last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Latest industry figures suggest that number is even higher. In Europe, they accounted for roughly one in five sales, while in China, the world's biggest car market, sales of such cars accounted for almost half of overall sales last year, according to the IEA, and they are expected to become the majority this year. Take-up in some other countries, like Norway and Nepal, is even greater. Electric vehicles (EVs) tend to account for a smaller share of sales in Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia - but growth there has been surging. Policy differences Analysts say adoption in the US has been slowed by comparatively weak government support for the sector, which has limited the kinds of subsidies, trade-in programmes and rules that have helped the industry in places such as China, the UK and Europe. Former President Joe Biden pushed hard to increase take-up, aiming for electric cars to account for half of all sales in the US by 2030. His administration tightened rules on emissions, boosted demand through purchases for government fleets, nudged carmakers to invest with loans and grants for EV investments, spent billions building charging stations and expanded the $7,500 tax credit as a sweetener for buyers. Supporters cast those efforts in part as a competitive imperative, warning that without these US carmakers would risk losing out to competitors from China and other countries. But President Donald Trump, who recently called climate change a ""con job"", has pushed to scrap many of those measures, including the $7,500 credit, arguing that they were pushing people to buy cars they would not otherwise want. ""We're saying ... you're not going to be forced to make all of those cars,"" he said this summer, while signing a bill aimed at striking down rules from California, which would have phased out sales of petrol-only cars in the state by 2035. ""You can make them, but it'll be by the market, judged by the market."" Bloomberg via Getty Images Electric cars have become more affordable in the US in recent years - but they still cost more than comparable petrol-powered vehicles. And Chinese carmakers like BYD, which have made rapid inroads in other markets thanks to low prices, have been effectively shut out of the US, due to high tariffs targeting cars made in China, backed by both Biden and Trump. As of August, the average transaction price of an electric car in the US was more than $57,000, according to auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, about 16% higher than the average for all cars. The least expensive battery car on offer, a Nissan Leaf, costs about $30,000 (£22,000). By comparison, several models can be found for under £20,000 in the UK. Analysts say what buyers do next hinges on how carmakers set prices in the months ahead, as they contend not only with the end of the tax credit but also tariffs on foreign cars and certain car parts that Trump introduced this spring. Hyundai said this week it would offset the loss of the tax credit by lowering the price for its range of Ioniq EVs. But Tesla said the cost for monthly lease payments of some of its cars would rise. Stephanie Brinley, associate director of S&P Global Mobility, said she did not expect to see many firms follow Hyundai's example, given the pressures from tariffs. While some buyers may opt for EVs anyway, ""next year is going to be hard,"" she warned, noting that her firm is calling for overall car sales to fall by roughly 2% in 2026. ""It would have been difficult enough if all you had to deal with is new tariffs, but with new tariffs and the incentive going away, there's two impacts."" Carmakers had already been scaling back their investments in electric cars. Researchers say Trump's policy changes could reduce those investments even more. ""It's a big hit to the EV industry - there's no tiptoeing around it,"" said Katherine Yusko, research analyst at the American Security Project ""The subsidies were initially a way to level the playing field and now that they're gone the US has a lot of ground to make up."" However Ms Brinley said she was hesitant to declare the US behind in an industry still testing out technology alternatives. ""Is [electric] really the right thing?"" she said. ""Saying that we're behind assumes that this is the only and best solution and I think it's a little early to say that.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ex2l58en4o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1211/live/e939d750-9fbe-11f0-b73e-e715acbd6a10.jpg,2025-10-05T07:45:21.055000+00:00,fbdb13b747bbad04afb1a8e85aabe3a30e2a5b34
94d7c33551e6,Harrods sets aside more than £60m for abuse compensation,,"Harrods sets aside more than £60m for abuse compensation Marc Ashdown Business correspondent and Imogen James Getty Images Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of historical abuse. More than 100 employees of the luxury department store are expected to claim up to £385,000 each via the redress scheme which is open until March 2026. The scheme, launched in March, provides to victims who claim they have suffered abuse by former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who died in 2023. Multiple women have accused Fayed, who owned the luxury store between 1985 to 2010, of rape and sexual assault. The Met Police said that 146 people have come forward to report a crime in their investigation into Fayed. Harrods have set aside £57 million to be used to compensate alleged victims, with an extra £5.3m reserved to cover legal and administrative costs, bringing the total amount allocated to £62.3 million. Harrods Managing director Michael Ward said that ""more than 100 survivors"" have joined the process of the scheme since it was opened. He added: ""Compensation awards and interim payments began being issued to eligible survivors at the end of April 2025 and the scheme will remain open until 31 March 2026."" The compensation scheme will award each eligible claimant general damages of £200,000. They could receive up to £385,000 in compensation, plus treatment costs, if they agree to be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist, or up to £150,000 without a medical assessment, Harrods said in March . Partially due to the scheme, Harrods recorded a £34.3 million loss in its latest full year accounts, compared with a profit of £111 million the previous year. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: ""While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future."" To be eligible for the scheme, claimants must prove that they were subject to sexual assault and/or wrongful testing, and prove that Harrods is liable. Many of those who say Fayed abused them underwent intrusive medical examinations when they were hired. In accepting a compensation offer, victims will waive their right to pursue further action for damages. The Harrods Group also operates smaller stores at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as a small chain of beauty stores. Revenues for the financial year 2024 were broadly flat at just over £1bn. It blamed the drop in profits on weaker beauty trading and modernising some of its systems. Mr Ward added: ""The current domestic and global economic environment means that current trading conditions in the luxury sector remain challenging. ""However, we remain confident in the strength of the business, and the resilience of the luxury sector, and that we will continue to drive progress towards longer-term growth and performance objectives."" Fayed was not charged before his death two years ago.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20ky6n79eo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cff8/live/be03c110-a12e-11f0-a9f1-8d9167fcc08f.jpg,2025-10-04T14:31:40.096000+00:00,17ef6fd69be9106f799ee1f1fe8fdd9875a65ac6
03517695c60b,Barrowman says chase our partners for the money,,"A company linked to Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman passed most of the money it received from the government for personal protective equipment (PPE) to other firms, according to a spokesperson for Mr Barrowman. On Wednesday a judge ordered PPE Medpro to repay £122m as the gowns it supplied did not meet sterility certification standards. However, £83m of that was paid to other companies and there was a ""very strong case"" for the administrator to chase them for the money, the spokesperson said. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said his department would seek to ""recover everything we can"". When Mr Barrowman spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in 2023 , he said PPE Medpro was set up as a consortium with companies called Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates. In that interview, Mr Barrowman said: ""The British government would have preferred to always trade with a UK company, so we created PPE Medpro as a UK business, so that the three partners could provide PPE to the British government."" Baroness Mone, a Conservative peer at the time, used her contacts to enter the company into the ""VIP lane"" to get preferential access to government contracts. Mr Barrowman's spokesperson claimed that the company itself did not undertake the technical work of liaising with manufacturers in China, including quality control and sterility assurance levels. The other parties distanced themselves from PPE Medpro once the government began legal action, and only communicated through lawyers, the spokesperson said. A High Court judgement on Wednesday ordered PPE Medpro to repay £122m to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), having ruled that the gowns the company supplied did not meet sterility certification standards. The day before, the directors of PPE Medpro started the process of putting the company into administration. Administrators will seek to wind the company up and try to recover as much money as possible for creditors. However, the company only has £666,000 of assets, so it is unlikely to be able to repay the DHSC in full. The government has said it will work closely with the administrators. Despite Baroness Mone not being a shareholder or director of the company, some politicians have called on her to repay the money personally. The spokesperson for Mr Barrowman said: ""It seems incredibly unfair that all the attention has focused on Doug Barrowman when there was a consortium. ""There is a very strong case for the administrator [of PPE Medpro] to chase the other consortium members whose companies received huge funds."" However, Mr Barrowman has admitted receiving a large share of the proceeds himself. In his 2023 interview, he told the BBC he had received around £60m from PPE Medpro. Baroness Mone said that a share of that sum was paid into a trust in the Isle of Man, of which she and her children are beneficiaries, and so potentially stand to receive the money. Loudwater's parent company, Loudwater Holdings Ltd, is based in North London. It had net assets of more than £55m, according to its latest accounts, and a turnover of £95m. The National Crime Agency is investigating the PPE Medpro case. It declined to comment on whether it was also looking into the other members of the consortium. Loudwater declined to comment. Eric Beare Associates did not respond to requests for comment. The DHSC did not say whether it would pursue other members of the consortium.

Now they can't get their money back Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent BBC ""Throw your current lifestyle overboard!"" boasts the advert for Victoria Cruises Line (VCL), which bills itself as the world's first affordable residential cruise. Cabins typically go for US$3,840 (£2,858) a month for a three-year voyage to 115 countries, and travellers from all over the world have the option of doing the route for as long as they like. For Australians Dennis and Taryna Wawn from Perth, excited by the prospect of a home at sea, the advert on Facebook couldn't have come at a better time as they planned their retirement. Three years later, the ship has yet to sail. In fact, they and other would-be cruise residents have found that VCL does not even own or have a lease on the ship that is being advertised. The Wawns are just two of dozens of people who have been waiting for VCL to refund their deposits, the BBC has learned. Other would-be residents told the BBC they sold their homes, rehomed cats and put their belongings into storage. One woman said she had put down her sick dog, believing she would be gone for years. Another couple have now had to move into a retirement community because of their advanced ages and failing health. They could no longer commit to a residential cruise that might or might not ever sail. ""The people that put down a deposit for this cruise were sold a dream... and it has turned into nothing short of a nightmare,"" said Adam Glezer, who runs a consumer advocacy company. ""What VCL has done is disgusting."" Those affected have contacted the company, some have launched legal cases and others have filed consumer complaints to government agencies. One even wrote to the FBI. VCL told the BBC that it still needs more customers before a vessel can be chartered and so is continuing to advertise the cruise. The company said customers knew about the occupancy condition when booking, and the company denies targeting or harming anyone, adding that it advised some clients not to sell homes to pay deposits. Many of those who signed up have given up hope of the ship ever sailing, or of getting their money back. 'All above board' Dennis and Taryna Wawn from Perth, Australia said the retirement cruise seemed like a dream Taryna, 64, said that in May 2022, she and Dennis were starting to think about their future and what it could look like when they came across the residential cruise. The couple feel they did their due diligence. Taryna said the company had a well-built and detailed website, they also spoke to a man from the company ""who answered all the questions"", and they joined a Facebook group made up of other cruise ""residents"". ""We did some checking, thought it was all above board,"" she said. Within a month, they took the step of paying a deposit of US$10,000 (£7,450). Their bank transfer has been viewed by the BBC. But weeks before they were due to set sail in May 2023, VCL postponed the scheduled departure date. In an email viewed by the BBC, VCL said the cruise hadn't reached a roughly 80% occupancy - something the company said it needed in order to charter a vessel. When VCL postponed twice more, the couple started to think something was up. Then a fellow would-be resident got in touch, saying: ""I've dug a little bit further. Get out."" 'Our shared dream is very much alive' The website of Victoria Cruises Line is still advertising the cruise even though the ship has not yet sailed VCL's marketing promised a fully-fledged cruise liner that could house 1,350 guests, with pools, tennis courts and an Italian restaurant. ""We do have a beautiful, seaworthy ship, the former Holland American Veendam, now the Majestic,"" VCL's US representative wrote on the company's Facebook page. But the BBC has learned that on being contacted by some would-be residents, the firm that owns the ship denied any association with VCL. Although it has not yet leased a ship, the company said it has continued to advertise the cruise and collect deposits in order to reach the necessary occupancy rate. ""If we had signed the lease agreement at the beginning of 2024, we would have had to pay approximately USD 18 million for nothing,"" VCL said in an email to the BBC. It also acknowledged that there had been 132 cancellations, and said it investigated 38 complaints, but found none justified a refund. VCL also denied there were any ""victims"", and said that 38 customers who asked for refunds cannot accept they were not entitled to one. The company added that the refunds were withheld for administrative reasons, missing or incorrect bank details, failure to return termination administration agreements within deadlines, and anti-money laundering checks. VCL's cruise was last scheduled to depart on 26 July 2025, according to its website. But once again it failed to set sail. ""Despite the delay, we've been encouraged by a surprising influx of new interest in recent weeks - a strong signal that our shared dream is very much alive,"" VCL's website reads. 'It got dirty' Graham Whittaker, a former journalist based in Australia, estimates that VCL has taken money that goes into the millions. ""It got dirty because we started to find scores and scores more people who had never been refunded, who had asked for their money back, who had been lied to,"" Whittaker said. When passengers pushed harder - asking about refunds, and talking to the media about the case - they were threatened with legal action. The BBC has seen dozens of such emails. ""The threats and the harassments are getting serious for some,"" Whittaker said. VCL justified the threat of legal action in its email to the BBC. ""Yes, we will take legal action against anyone who tries to settle their complaint on social media,"" it said. The paper trail Company records reviewed by the BBC show a web of shell businesses registered to the same address in Budapest, some now no longer trading. The company is also registered in Florence, Italy, but as a specialised wholesaler of food, beverages and tobacco. In Hungary, Viktória Takács-Ollram is listed as the founder, while her 79-year-old mother is registered as the chief executive. Another company is registered under the same address to Viktória's son, Marcell Herold, who is named as the vice president of VCL on its website. In Hungary, VCL was registered in 2017 under a different name as an accounting and tax advising firm. That changed to VCL in 2022, with ""services auxiliary to waterborne transport"" and ""rental of water transport equipment"" added. In 2023 new activities were added: ""car rental"", ""lending of other machinery and equipment"". As of 1 January 2025, its main activity is listed as ""passenger transport by sea"". Tax filings indicate more than $253,000 in unpaid taxes. Taking matters into their own hands A couple won a case in Hungary, overturning VCL's contract changes, but enforcement stalled when VCL shifted its base to Italy. VCL admitted to the BBC that it changed contracts after customers signed, and that new terms would apply retroactively. ""When drafting a contract, lawyers try to include everything. But sometimes life happens and the contract needs to be amended. That is what happened in this case,"" VCL said. ""These contracts work this way for all shipping companies."" The Utah investigation found that VCL had not booked a departure port as advertised on its website Another couple filed a complaint in the US state of Utah, with the investigation finding that a berth was not booked on a stated departure date. It also found that people purporting to be hired staff on the website did not plan to be on the cruise, nor had they received offers of employment. The investigation ruling said that VCL's US representative encouraged people to sign up for the cruise. The investigation found that she truthfully believed the residential cruise was going to sail, but she agreed to sign a compliance order barring her from promoting such travel services in the future. 'Not a phantom company' Despite all of this, VCL continues to advertise its cruise on Facebook and Instagram. Accounts on the platforms show glossy brochures of the ship's decks, menus and cabins. Investigators contacted some of the people purported to be crew, who said they had not received employment offers New ""residents"" are shown posing on board - many of them are actually stock images widely available on the internet. To encourage lengthy stays, the cruise company has been offering hefty discounts, flash sales and cashback schemes. Alleged victims say they have reported the ads repeatedly, but Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram - has declined to take them down. ""It is reprehensible that these platforms are allowing advertising for VCL despite the significant amount of evidence. They should be held accountable for this,"" said consumer champion Adam Glezer. In a statement, Meta told the BBC that its advertising standards strictly prohibit deceptive or misleading ads, including scams, but it found no evidence that the page violates its policies. VCL denied that it was running a scam, saying those affected were unable to accept that they were not entitled to a refund. ""Our company has never disappeared, we have responded to every email, so we are not a phantom company."" Taryna said the idea of the cruise isn't too good to be true - some people who signed up for the VCL cruise were currently travelling the world with other cruise liners. However, for her and Dennis, going on another such cruise is no longer something they can afford. ""It was a dream for us and we were really focusing on it as a lovely adventure. It's been traumatising.""

525d4cc472f7,Sales of electric cars hit record high in September,,"Sales of electric cars hit record high in September Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK hit a record high last month, according to the latest industry figures. Sales of pure battery electric vehicles (BEV) grew by almost a third to 72,779 in September, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT), while sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster. It means sales of fully electric or hybrid vehicles made up more than half of all new car registrations in the UK last month. The SMMT said sales were driven by carmakers offering discounts, a larger choice of models, and the introduction of the government's grant scheme. While registrations of BEVs rose last month, the overwhelming majority - 71.4% - were bought by businesses or to be used in fleets. However, the number of private buyers of fully electric cars has risen in the past year, and the SMMT said zero-emission vehicles now accounted for more than one in five (22.1%) new cars registered so far in 2025. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said electrified vehicles were ""powering market growth after a sluggish summer"". Industry investment in electric vehicles was ""paying off"", he said, despite consumer demand ""trailing ambition"". Mr Hawes added the government's electric car grant scheme, in which eligible vehicles get a discount of up to £3,750 as part of efforts to encourage drivers to move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, would help ""break down one of the barriers"" holding back people making the switch. Overall, the number of new vehicle registrations -  312,887 - marked the best performing September since 2020, which despite the Covid lockdown restrictions, remains the best so far this decade, according to the SMMT. The strong month comes as the UK car industry navigates the economic impact of US tariffs and Jaguar Land Rover's shutdown of production due to a major cyber-attack . The Kia Sportage, Ford Puma and Nissan Qashqai were the best-selling cars in September, but two Chinese models including the Jaecoo 7 and BYD Seal U were in the top 10. The government said more than 20,000 people had benefited from EV grants to date, which apply to models from several well-known brands such as Ford, Toyota, Vauxhall and Citroen. Under the scheme, the discount applies to new eligible car models costing up to £37,000, with the most environmentally friendly ones seeing the biggest reductions. Some 36 models have been cleared for discounts of at least £1,500. Ian Plummer, Autotrader's chief commercial officer, said the grant scheme had given a ""real lift to the market"". ""Since July, enquiries for new electric vehicles on Autotrader are up by almost 50%. For models eligible for the grant, interest has more than doubled.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd094168go,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e058/live/ac7c44b0-a06d-11f0-8687-4726d7177866.jpg,2025-10-04T00:41:12.022000+00:00,c2cee89e2b64b3f9778f038b685524a65a696171
151360c42ea1,Rail firm fined £1m over train passenger's death,,"Rail firm fined £1m over train passenger's death Tess de la Mare West of England PA Media Bethan Roper was returning home from a Christmas shopping trip when she died on the train on 1 December 2018 A major rail operator has been fined £1m for breaching health and safety law when a young woman suffered a fatal injury after placing her head outside a droplight window. Bethan Roper, 28, was killed on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train near Twerton in Bath on 1 December 2018 when her head struck a tree branch. Regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR on the grounds it was aware of the issue of droplight windows, and had not yet implemented steps identified in a risk assessment undertaken two months before Ms Roper's death. GWR was fined and also ordered to pay £78,000 after pleading guilty to two counts of breaching health and safety law. Richard Hines, ORR's chief inspector of railways, said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Bethan Roper. ""Her death was a preventable tragedy that highlights the need for train operators to proactively manage risks and act swiftly when safety recommendations are made to keep their passengers safe."" GWR told BBC West: ""Bethan Roper's death was a tragic incident, and our thoughts remain with her family and friends. ""We accept the judge's decision and remain committed to continuously improving passenger and colleague safety across our network. ""In sentencing, the judge recognised our strong safety record both before and after this incident, and the safety of our passengers and colleagues remains our highest priority."" Ms Roper, from Penarth in Wales, worked for the Welsh Refugee Council, was a Unite union convener and also chaired the Cardiff West branch of Socialist Party Wales. She had been returning home from a Christmas shopping trip in Bath and was intoxicated when she boarded the train, an inquest held in 2021 heard. PA/Cardiff School of Journalism Bethan Roper worked for the Wales Refugee Council Investigators told the inquest that a yellow warning label above the window bearing the words ""Caution do not lean out of window when train is moving"" was an insufficient deterrent. Ms Roper's death echoed a similar incident in 2016 in which a passenger died near Balham, south London, resulting in the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) issuing safety recommendations in May 2017. GWR did not produce a written risk assessment until September 2017, but that assessment found droplight windows to be one of the most significant passenger safety risks. The ORR found the assessment to be insufficient and wrote to GWR about its concerns. However the assessment was not revised, and the actions GWR had set out to reduce the risk were not implemented before the fatal accident of 2018, the ORR said. Since Ms Roper's death, measures have been introduced across the rail industry to prevent passengers leaning out of droplight windows. Trains with such windows have since been withdrawn from service or fitted with engineering controls to prevent windows being opened while trains are moving. The ORR said it welcomed actions taken by GWR and the wider industry to reduce risk.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20ej7rkj3ko,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7f2a/live/7f80e460-a104-11f0-ac34-1b87a37e0e9a.jpg,2025-10-04T15:17:17.671000+00:00,fc6d7f2d229e4786529318ee88beb6eae68f77e4
db76d8aa3239,Renault customers told to be vigilant after data hack,,"Renault UK has confirmed that some of its customers' data has been stolen in a cyber-attack that targeted a third-party data processing provider. No customer financial data, such as passwords or bank account details, had been obtained, Renault said, but other personal data had been accessed and the carmaker warned customers to be vigilant. The French-owned carmaker would not specify how many people could be affected ""for ongoing security reasons"" but said it did not anticipate any wider implications for the company, as none of Renault's own systems had been hacked. It comes after rival Jaguar Land Rover and brewing giant Asahi have had production stopped by cyber-attacks on their systems. Renault UK said affected people would be notified and that victims of the hack may include a wider pool of people who had entered competitions or shared data with the car company, without purchasing a vehicle. The carmaker said the data that had been accessed by the cyber-attack included some or all of: customer names, addresses, dates of birth, gender, phone number, vehicle identification numbers and vehicle registration details. A Renault spokesperson said: ""The third-party provider has confirmed this is an isolated incident which has been contained, and we are working with it to ensure that all appropriate actions are being taken. We have notified all relevant authorities. ""We are in the process of contacting all affected customers, advising them of the cyber-attack and reminding them to be cautious of any unsolicited requests for personal information,"" they added. Jaguar Land Rover was recently forced to stop production and take a £1.5bn loan underwritten by the government after being targeted by hackers at the end of August.

19566e62ad26,True cost of becoming a mum highlighted in new data on pay,,"True cost of becoming a mum highlighted in new data on pay Femilola Miller Femilola Miller says the motherhood penalty is ""engrained in society"" Mums in England face a ""substantial and long-lasting reduction"" in earnings after having children, according to new findings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Five years after having their first child, mums' earnings drop by an average of £1,051 a month compared with their salary one year before having a child. Mums' earnings continue to be affected after the births of second and third children. Rachel Grocott, chief executive of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, called the findings ""completely abhorrent"" and said the impact of the motherhood penalty is ""not just unfair - it's avoidable"". In the first dataset of its kind , the ONS has looked at the earnings and employment status of mums after having a first, second and third child over an eight-year period from April 2014 to December 2022. Mums earn £313 a month less on average five years after the birth of their second child, and £689 a month less five years after their third child. Each figure is compared to their salary one year before each birth. Mums suffer ""maximum losses"" in the first year after their children are born, when they are more likely to take extended parental leave than dads. When compared with a mum's earnings in the year before the birth of a child, the total loss in earnings over five years was: £65,618 for a first child £26,317 for a second child £32,456 for a third child Femilola Miller, from London, has three children aged seven, five and three. Before starting a family, she and her husband David had similar salaries, but he now earns £55,000 a year more than her. Both she and her husband took several months off work after the birth of each child, ""but every time my husband went back to work, he got a promotion"". ""Mothers are not compensated even if they return to work full time and are dedicated to their career."" She believes the motherhood penalty is ""engrained in society"" and some people enforce the stereotypes ""without even realising"", she says, remembering several comments people had made to her about whether she would return to work after having children. ""It was not even a question about what was going to happen to David's career,"" she says. ""I had a career before I had children and I want to carry on working full-time."" Femilola Miller Femilola has three children aged seven, five and three Although the gender pay gap is slowly reducing in the UK, women working full time still earn 7% less than men . Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said the motherhood penalty was ""a perfect storm of bias, outdated legislation and cultural norms"". She added ""the vast majority"" of the gender pay gap is linked to the motherhood penalty, which can be attributed to a number of factors, including: unaffordable childcare costs for some families an unbalanced parental leave system some jobs not offering flexible and part-time working hours pregnancy and maternity discrimination The government has introduced 30 hours a week of funded childcare for working parents and is undertaking a review of parental leave . New laws also came into force in England, Wales and Scotland last year which give women greater protection against redundancy while pregnant or on maternity leave. But, according to research from Pregnant then Screwed and Women in Data, up to 74,000 new or expectant mums lose their jobs each year due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination. Evie Jay Evie says mums often feel like they ""can't win"" in the juggle between work and parenthood Evie, 33, from Newcastle, says she feels as though her career is ""on hold"" until her daughter goes to school. Evie initially reduced her hours at work when three-year-old Ellie was born, but now works 35 hours a week in the NHS. She wants to retrain as a therapist, but doing so would mean she could no longer work from home, which isn't compatible with her childcare arrangements. She described becoming a mum as ""the best thing that's happened to me, but career-wise, it has been a punishment"". ""You're expected to be a parent like you don't work, but work like you haven't got kids. You can't win."" Emma Potts, manager of Market Place Cafe in Stoke-on-Trent, says it is ""a really difficult balance"" for small businesses like hers to accommodate flexible working, part-time hours or maternity cover. ""We always try to be as supportive as possible, but the reality is that in a small team, flexibility is much harder to manage."" If staff members were to reduce their hours to part-time, ""it would cause real issues"", she says. ""Ultimately, smaller businesses like ours don't have the luxury of large teams or spare capacity. ""Every shift matters, every deadline matters, and every absence makes a difference."" Katie Guild, co-founder of Nugget Savings, a business that helps new and expectant parents with financial planning, says the impact of having children can be ""shocking"" on finances, but there are a number of things parents can do. This includes checking which benefits you are entitled to and ensuring your employer still contributes to your pension based on your salary as it was before maternity leave. ""Unfortunately, a lot of what we deal with is mothers having difficult situations with their employers and not knowing whether they have a leg to stand on legally,"" she says. ""Knowing your rights is really crucial.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq4x697q5o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d165/live/0842cff0-9fc7-11f0-9657-87c2ccf2abb3.jpg,2025-10-03T13:57:45.861000+00:00,7a061578389ae677375bae4db94c9ae15d0f648a
c2f5d01e6446,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader",,"Tax wealthiest to end rip-off Britain, says Green leader Kate Whannel Political reporter Green Party leader of England and Wales Zack Polanski:  'We will make sure that the very wealthiest pay more tax' Newly-elected Green Party leader Zack Polanski has told his party's conference a tax on the wealthiest would end ""rip-off Britain"" and make the country ""an affordable"" place to live. Addressing members in Bournemouth, he said taxing the assets of the richest 1% would enable the government to fund universal free childcare, special needs education and rural bus routes. He also defended migrants and refugees to loud applause from the audience and accused Labour of being ""handmaidens"" of Reform UK adding: ""When Farage says jump, Labour asks 'how high'."" Polanski has described himself as an ""eco-populist"" and is seeking to shift the party to the left to take on Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party. The prime minister has sought to tighten immigration controls in recent months, in what is being seen by critics as a response to Reform leading national opinion polls. But Sir Keir launched an attack on Reform leader Nigel Farage in his Labour conference speech this week, accusing him of sowing division and not believing in Britain - something denied by Farage. Polanski described Farage as a ""Trump-loving corporate stooge"" and accused Sir Keir of jumping to his tune. Unusually for a speech by a Green Party leader, Polanski did not focus primarily on the environment. He told the conference: ""You can not be an effective environmentalist without talking about the deep inequality in our society."" Much of his speech centred on the problems posed by the cost of living, pointing to a rise in homelessness, tenants worried about their rent and families struggling to pay bills. Polanski argued that the country's problems were ""rooted in an economic model built on austerity and privatisation"" but that the Green Party would ""break the shackles of poverty and hardship that lock so many in"". ""This is a country with so much going for it, but we have been failed time and time again by a political class poisoned by extreme wealth and you can see that poison everyday."" ""A country where a tiny few have taken our power and wealth. Things must change. It's time to take it back."" He said some voters might worry that they could be hit by taxes on the wealthiest being proposed by his party. ""Hairdressers and plumbers say understandably 'I've worked hard all my life. Why are you taxing me? Why are you taxing my ambition?'"" However, Polanski said he was targeting people who ""will make more money in one night than everyone in this room could probably earn in an entire year"". In a 20 minute speech, Polanski told the conference his party's ""horizons"" would not be ""narrow"" and that he would ""not be silent"" on ""the mass slaughter in Palestine"". ""We must stop selling arms to Israel, we must stop sharing intelligence,"" he said. He also criticised what he called a ""draconian crackdown on the right to protest"". ""From terrorist proscription against protesters, to banning journalists from their conference, to diving into a rushed evidence-free plan for digital IDs that are likely to discriminate against minorities - the alarm bells of authoritarianism are now ringing."" In his defence of refugees and migrants, Polanski said it was the ""economic system"" that was a ""threat to the places we love... not people arriving small boats"". To loud cheers from party members he declared : ""We'll say it loud, we'll say it clear migrants and refugees are welcome here."" He said the Greens wanted to stop small boats crossing the Channel through ""safe and legal routes"". He also blamed ""a politics that tries to divide us and points the finger at each other, instead of at billionaires"". In a contrast with comments from Sir Keir earlier this year, who said the UK risked becoming an ""island of strangers"", Polanski said: ""This is a nation of neighbours."" He said defending migration was important to him because of his own ""confused and muddled"" Jewish ancestry, which saw his family flee from Latvia to Ukraine to Poland and eventually to England. Taking a moment to mark Thursday's attack on a synagogue in Manchester, where Polanski grew up, he said ""my heart is with the community."" In the past year the Green Party has built on its success at the 2024 general election - when it won four MPs - by winning 74 seats in the local council elections. Last month, Polanski was overwhelmingly backed by members in a leadership contest against the less combative duo of Green MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. Since the election the party says its membership has risen by 20% to an all-time high of 80,000. Polanski, who is a member of the London Assembly but does not have a seat in Parliament, has expressed interest in working with the new party being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Speaking after the leadership election, he said it was ""too soon to talk about joining electoral coalitions"", but he was interested in working with ""anyone who wants to challenge a failing Labour government and take on fascism and the far right"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y9nq174o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae45/live/a0ba2130-a061-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-03T15:51:35.614000+00:00,134dcec18ec417562e56e66eb70cb815d00c1415

He suggested Republicans should seize the opportunity to ""clear out dead wood"" and gave no hint of concessions to Democratic demands that legislation funding the government should include healthcare insurance subsidies. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, continued to blame each other for failing to keep federal agencies open. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are staying home, while others worked without pay. Some federal attractions closed to visitors while others, including the Statue of Liberty, stayed open. Watch: ""Find common ground"", tourists in Washington tell lawmakers amid shutdown Analysts don't expect either side to budge without pressure from everyday Americans, most of whom have yet to feel direct impacts on their lives. It was unclear exactly what Trump could decide in Thursday's meeting with Russell Vought, director of the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB). When Congress fails to keep the US government open, the OMB director works with the president to pick which government activities should stop and which are essential. It then gives directions to federal agencies about which employees to place on furlough, which means unpaid leave. On the first day of the shutdown, Vought said the White House had moved to pause or cancel billions of dollars in funding meant for Democratic states, including $18bn (£13.4bn) in infrastructure projects in New York - home of both Senator Chuck Schumer and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Both sides must come together to pass legislation if the government is to reopen. Republicans need eight Democratic senators to vote with them, while Democrats need 13 Republicans to side with them. Only three Democrats joined with Republicans on the last failed vote in the Senate on Wednesday. Lawmakers are expected to try again on Friday afternoon to resolve the impasse with a vote in the Senate. Republicans want to pass a funding measure without anything else attached, but Democrats want to include a renewal of health insurance subsidies for low-income individuals set to expire at the end of the year. Shutterstock Speaker of the US House Mike Johnson delivers remarks during a government shutdown press conference in the US Capitol in Washington on 02 October 2025 In duelling press conferences on Capitol Hill on Thursday, neither party appeared willing to give ground. House Speaker Mike Johnson called Democrats ""selfish"", dubbed it the ""Democrat shutdown"", and said he would not negotiate on adding insurance subsidies – or other measures - to government funding. Jeffries accused Republicans of not wanting to provide working-class Americans with healthcare and said Trump's threats to fire more federal workers were pointless. He noted: ""They have been firing federal employees all along."" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, said his polling suggested Americans were largely split down party lines when it came to assigning fault for the shutdown. Majorities of both Democratic and Republican respondents to his polls blamed the other party for the shutdown, he said, while 41% of independents said both parties shared the blame equally. ""Both of the parties have mastered the finger-pointing, and all we're left with is a growing number of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction,"" Miringoff said. He expected Americans to put pressure on Congress to reopen the government - but not until they see the impact of a shutdown on their own lives. Getty Images US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, speaks to reporters during a press conference at the US Capitol Building on 02 October, 2025 in Washington. As politicians traded barbs, US government services started to grind to a halt and thousands of federal workers stayed home. About 750,000 federal workers were expected to take unpaid leave, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Federal employees deemed ""essential"" continued to work, though without pay. They include more than 200,000 law enforcement officers. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers are considered essential, so air travel will not immediately be affected. During the last shutdown these employees increasingly began to call in sick, leading to some delays at major airports. Tourists were turned away from museums in Washington and New York, including at Federal Hall in Manhattan. A manager told the BBC the building was closed like other federal monuments. George Washington, the first US president, took the oath of office there in 1789. Now a museum, the historic building also was home to the first Congress and Supreme Court. But not all monuments are closed. Elsewhere in New York, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remained open, ""thanks to the leadership of President Donald J Trump"", a Department of the Interior spokesperson told the BBC. The Smithsonian, which includes more than a dozen museums and attractions that drew nearly 17 million visitors last year, told the BBC it had enough money to stay open for a week.

On Friday, a spokesperson for German flag carrier Lufthansa said ""flight operations have since resumed according to schedule"". There was no immediate confirmation of where the drones had come from. Several airports across Europe have closed down in recent weeks because of unidentified drones. Munich airport alerted authorities after the drones were detected. Departing flights were ""suspended"", the airport said , and it closed two hours ahead of its usual midnight to 05:00 curfew. Air traffic control redirected flights that were due to land in Munich to Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Vienna, and Frankfurt. ""Nineteen Lufthansa flights were affected, either cancelled or re-routed, because of the the airport suspension,"" the spokesperson said. Because it was dark, no information on the type, size or origins of the drones was confirmed, Federal Police spokesperson Stefan Bayer told the Bild Newspaper. The drones were first seen at 21:30 local time (19:30 GMT), and then again an hour later, police said. The BBC has contacted Germany's federal police. Meanwhile authorities in Belgium are investigating sightings of 15 drones, which were seen above the Elsenborn military site near the German border, Belgian media reports. After the sighting, the drones reportedly flew from Belgium to Germany, where they were also observed by the police in the small German town of Düren. It is not yet clear where the drones originated or who operated them. Recent drone sightings across the European Union prompted a leaders' summit in Copenhagen this week . 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland and Russian MiG-31 jets entered Estonian airspace in separate recent incidents. Copenhagen and Oslo airports were forced to close after unidentified drones were spotted near airport and military airspaces. Russia has denied any involvement, while Danish authorities say there was no evidence Moscow was involved. Speaking to a summit in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin laughed off suggestions he ordered drones to Denmark. ""I won't do it again. I won't do it again - not to France or Denmark or Copenhagen"", Putin said. Thousands of passengers were stranded at Munich overnight. ""Camp beds were set up, and blankets, drinks, and snacks were provided,"" the airport said. The city is currently hosting the annual Oktoberfest festival, which is due to end on 5 October. It attracts more than six million people a year, according to the official website. The annual beer festival had already closed for half a day on Wednesday after a bomb scare.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1e7j5ew9o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bfe7/live/25831280-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T08:26:10.243000+00:00,0d22d3dd6fd886496e51e42477b1e3be5dc90ffb
d5dacca26316,Baroness Mone accuses chancellor of 'inflammatory' language,,"Baroness Mone accuses chancellor of 'inflammatory' language Pritti Mistry Business reporter Getty Images Baroness Michelle Mone is linked to a company set up by a consortium led by her husband, Doug Barrowman, which was awarded a government contract in 2020 Baroness Michelle Mone has accused the chancellor of using ""dangerous and inflammatory"" language after a firm linked to her and her husband was ordered to pay £122m for breaching a Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) contract. During a fringe event at Labour's party conference this week, Rachel Reeves reportedly joked the government had a vendetta against the peer. In a letter to the prime minister, Baroness Mone said her language was ""incendiary and has directly increased the risks to my personal safety"". She claimed she received ""threats and abuse"" on social media since Reeves' remarks. On Wednesday, a judge ruled that PPE Medpro's gowns did not comply with government standards. PPE Medpro was set up by a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman. It was awarded a government contract to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone. However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. Since Wednesday's court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage. She is currently on a leave of absence from the House of Lords and Reeves has said she does not want her to return. On Thursday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told BBC News that Baroness Mone should be stripped of her title . However, peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Baroness Mone demanded Sir Keir Starmer order an  ""urgent, independent investigation into whether ministers or officials have improperly influenced the NCA [National Crime Agency], CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and civil litigation process"". She also insisted the chancellor retract her comments. Baroness Mone told Sir Keir: ""I feel compelled to alert you to the dangerous and inflammatory statement made by your Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves."" She said the word vendetta referred to ""vengeance, feud and blood feud"" and that Reeves' comments had made her and her family feel unsafe. She also said her social media had ""gone into meltdown with threats and abuse"", adding ""we need only look at the tragedies of Jo Cox and Sir David Amess to understand the dangers of such reckless language,"" she said. Jo Cox was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen and was killed in 2016. Sir David Amess was the Conservative MP for Southend West when he was fatally stabbed in 2021. Concluding her letter, Baroness Mone said: ""Prime Minister, I ask you directly: do you stand by your chancellor's assertion that the government has a vendetta against me? Or will you act decisively to end this campaign, protect my safety, and restore integrity to government? ""Failure to take urgent action will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including defamation, harassment, and misfeasance claims, while also taking steps to ensure my personal safety and that of my family."" The Cabinet Office declined to comment. However, a Treasury source told the BBC: ""When both the Labour chancellor and Conservative leader agree with each other you've lost the argument."" Mone was made a Tory peer by David Cameron in 2015, but lost the whip following the revelations about the contract to supply medical gowns. The High Court ruled PPE Medpro failed to prove whether or not its surgical gowns, which were to be used by NHS workers, had undergone a validated sterilisation process. Following the ruling, Mrs Justice Cockerill said the £122m damages cost must be paid by 16:00 BST on 15 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9y5nkxpzlo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9197/live/5c8dfd50-9fbd-11f0-b73e-e715acbd6a10.jpg,2025-10-02T18:36:40.812000+00:00,f7f09a2cc1f4ad9948b3ee5327285f120385ffff
7085b0d42a07,Tesco warns 'enough is enough' on business taxes,,"Tesco warns 'enough is enough' on business taxes Josh Martin Business reporter Getty Images Tesco expects to make a profit this year of up to £3.1bn The boss of Tesco has warned the government against adding extra costs to UK retailers in the upcoming Budget, saying ""enough is enough"". Ken Murphy said he did not want to see a repeat of the last Budget, when ""the industry incurred substantial additional operating costs"". His comments came as the UK's largest supermarket upgraded its profit forecast for the year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will reveal her Budget on 26 November, with the widespread expectation that some taxes will increase. Many retailers have argued they have been hit with a wave of extra costs since April, including increased employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) and higher minimum wages. In addition, Tesco and other food and drink companies are now charged for the cost to councils of recycling the packaging of some of its products, under the government's Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) programme. The company said it had set aside £90m in ERP levies, which came into force last month. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) has predicted this tax will cost UK producers £1.1bn, more than the impact from the hike in NICs. Jim Bligh, head of corporate affairs at the FDF, told the BBC earlier this week that most of those taxes would be passed on to shoppers. ""So inevitably that means that food prices will increase as a result of these decision by successive governments over the years,"" he said. Mr Murphy said the new and higher taxes were ""an additional burden on the industry. As was the increase in NICs. As is higher commodity prices. There's a raft of factors impacting the cost of doing business"". Tesco said the higher National Insurance rate cost it £235m this year. Regarding the upcoming Budget, Mr Murphy said: ""Our one ask is don't make it harder for the industry to deliver great value for customers."" The Tesco chief executive's warning follows similar interventions from other retailers. Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium said that ""any further tax rises in the upcoming Budget would keep shop prices higher for longer"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The tax decisions we took at the Budget last year mean that we have been able to deliver on the priorities of the British people, from investing in the NHS to cut waiting lists and putting more money in their pockets with a wage boost for millions."" They added that the government has capped corporation tax at 25% and was reforming business rates. Mr Murphy's comments came as the retail giant upgraded its profit outlook for the year, saying it now expected to see full-year adjusted operating profits of £2.9bn-£3.1bn. Tesco said that although intense competition had led it to cut the price of 6,500 items, shoppers were adding more to their baskets and therefore its profits were set to increase. The Unite union said Tesco had ""profited from the cost of living crisis"". Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""As millions of workers struggle to put food on the table, Tesco is raking in huge amounts of cash and paying out whopping dividends to shareholders. ""It is time the Labour government stops being missing in action when it comes to tackling profiteering. Workers must no longer pay the price for corporate greed."" Shoppers 'worried' Mr Murphy said sales data suggested more shoppers were buying more fresh ingredients to cook meals from scratch, possibly in order to save money. The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew across all retailers at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge, official data for August showed. Mr Murphy said Tesco - which has about 28% of the UK grocery market - was raising prices at a lower rate than the market average. Households might be holding off on spending until after the chancellor sets out her tax and spending plans, Mr Murphy said. ""They are concerned and worried about the Budget and the economic outlook,"" he  added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c784q26v57vo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b8ca/live/39c71a80-9f82-11f0-9ccd-4dc2d8fa5ad2.jpg,2025-10-02T14:31:54.135000+00:00,8e945f2cf6ea412e001ef29b1e5538b14fbf5057
82ce7787a670,Denmark loses £1.4bn tax fraud claim in UK court case,,"Denmark loses £1.4bn tax fraud claim in UK court case Theo Leggett International business correspondent and Michael Sheils McNamee Business reporter Getty Images Sanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year Denmark's tax authority has lost a £1.4bn fraud case at the High Court in London in one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK. Skatteforvaltningen, known as Skat, argued huge sums of cash had been falsely claimed in tax rebates - as part of so-called ""cum-ex schemes"". The main named defendant in the case was defunct hedgefund Solo Capital Partners, run by trader Sanjay Shah, who was jailed in a criminal trial in Denmark last year . Ruling on the case, Mr Justice Andrew Baker said the Danish tax authority had not been misled into making the payments. The case was deciding on whether Skat was deceived into paying the tax refunds, as it had claimed. ""Greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here,"" said Mr Justice Baker. ""However, the evidence at trial did not persuade me to accept Skat's claim, and I do not make the findings it sought."" The judgement noted that of the 4,170 dividend refund claims between mid-2012 and mid-2015 examined as part of the trial, none were valid claims under Danish tax law - and all of them could have been rejected. However, Mr Justice Baker said the tax authority's ""controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be almost non-existent"". He said Skat had ""failed to established any of the claims pursued at trial where liability was disputed"". In a statement, the Danish government said its tax authority ""strongly disagrees with the premises of the judgment and is now seeking to appeal it"". How cum-ex schemes worked Cum-ex schemes were a method of exploiting weaknesses in tax regimes of different European countries and are believed to have cost European governments billions. They were carried out with the sole purpose of generating multiple refunds of a tax that had only been paid once. The schemes would work by taking advantage of the period when a company paid out dividends to shareholders. Shares would be sold by one investor immediately before the dividends were paid (cum, or with, dividend), and delivered to a buyer afterwards (ex-dividend) - effectively creating confusion over who owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. It allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued. 'Not trustworthy' Solo Capital Partners was founded in 2009 by London-based trader Shah. It was widely seen as a key player in refining and exploiting the cum-ex trade – with its activities focused primarily on Denmark. In 2023, he was extradited to Denmark from Dubai to face trial, and in December last year he was convicted, and given the heaviest penalty ever in Denmark for a fraud case . In Thursday's judgement, Mr Justice Baker said Shah was ""not a trustworthy individual"" and his testimony had contained ""implausible claims and obvious lies"". ""I do not consider it safe, in general, to treat anything Mr Shah says for himself or about the Danish dividend tax refund factory he created as reliable evidence of fact,"" said Mr Justice Baker. However, the judgement found while this information gave ""some indirect support "" to the case put forward by Skat - it did not prove the tax authority's case. The 18-month trial was the culmination of an eight-year legal process - with Skat initially being denied the right to pursue its claim in the English courts, before winning an appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal sources suggest the costs could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. It originally involved more than 100 defendants, including some 40 individuals and a number of corporate entities. Whistleblower Jas Bains Jas Bains thanked the court for its ruling The judge also rejected a claim against Jas Bains, a lawyer who worked at Solo Capital Partners as a senior manager between 2010 and 2013, before joining another firm that was also later implicated in the cum-ex scandal. Giving evidence in the trial in April 2024, Mr Bains said he later became concerned about the sheer volume of cum-ex trades being carried out, after hearing reports that Solo Capital was engaged in transactions of huge value. Through an intermediary, he contacted the Danish authorities in 2015 to warn them of what was going on and over the next two years, assisted the Danish police in a subsequent investigation. Despite his role as a whistleblower, Mr Bains was included in the wide-ranging damages claim from Skat and has spent years fighting legal battles. Speaking to the BBC after the ruling, the lawyer said: ""This unnecessary trial cost me eight years of my life and I'm grateful to the justice system for exonerating me.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy852vyn054o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0e4c/live/67b19be0-9f92-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-02T13:08:31.417000+00:00,9a751451003bc70d235ac468ddb8cd892d361f69
632804b1f800,Thames Water lenders submit rescue plan to stave off collapse,,"Thames Water lenders submit rescue plan to stave off collapse Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images Thames Water's lenders have submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the UK's largest water company from collapsing. London & Valley Water, a consortium of large financial institutions and investors, has submitted proposals which include writing off about a third of the company's near £20bn debt pile and investing an initial £5.4bn to stabilise its finances. Fears that Thames could collapse first emerged more than two years ago, and the government has been on standby to supervise a form of temporary nationalisation. But the firm's investors said its plan would rebuild the company without the need for any taxpayer funding or government support. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. But it has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years over a series of sewage discharges and pipe leaks. In May, it was handed a £122.7m fine, the biggest ever issued by the water industry regulator, for breaching rules on sewage spills and shareholder payouts. London & Valley Water said on Thursday that its plan was the ""fastest and most reliable route"" to turn around Thames, clean up waterways and rebuild public trust. Investors said they would inject an initial £5.4bn into the company to shore up its finances and support future investment, but they suggested the cash injection needed to be set against ""stretching but achievable and realistic performance targets"". All water companies are subject to performance targets over leaks, pollution incidents and customer satisfaction levels. London & Valley has argued the current targets in place for the company are unachievable and its current business plan needs to be adjusted in order for Thames to attract future investment, rebuild the company and improve its performance for customers. But Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water which represents billpayers, said Thames ""should not receive special treatment around performance targets at a time when customers are paying more and have a right to expect more for their money"". He said recent customer complaints showed Thames had made ""some progress, but remains among the industry's worst performers and is the country's least trusted water company"". ""The acid test of this proposed rescue plan is whether it would actually deliver improvements for Thames Water customers, many of whom are fed up with receiving a poor service,"" he added. Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who appealed against a previous rescue loan for Thames that was eventually approved by the High Court earlier this year, said the creditors' plan was a ""terrible deal"". ""The government must bite the bullet - put Thames Water into special administration with a swift exit which finally puts customers first, under mutual ownership."" London & Valley said under its proposals no dividends would be paid out to shareholders over the duration of the turnaround plan and that new shareholders would commit not to sell the business prior to March 2030. Outstanding fines would also be paid, they added. London & Valley Water said it aimed to reach an agreement with Thames and water industry regulator Ofwat ""as quickly as possible this autumn given the urgent need to stabilise Thames Water"". A government spokesperson said it was ready ""for all eventualities"", including a situation in which the company collapsed into administration. ""The government will always act in the national interest on these issues,"" they added. Mike McTighe, the proposed future chair of Thames Water under the terms of plan, said ""from day one, we will inject billions in new investment"". He added that under a new company board, there would be a focus on ""reducing pollution and rebuilding public trust so that by the end of this decade Thames Water can once again be a reliable, resilient, and responsible company"". Ofwat said it would review the latest plans. In response to the proposals, Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, said the announcement marked an ""important milestone"" in the company's work to resolve its debt problems and secure its finances to ""support the investment and performance improvements our customers expect"". The revised turnaround proposals come after Thames suffered a major blow in its attempt to secure its future this summer when US private equity firm KKR pulled out of a £4bn deal. In July, the boss of Thames Water, Chris Weston, said the company was ""extremely stressed"" and that it would take ""at least a decade to turn around"". Water bills for households in England and Wales have risen by £10 per month on average this year, although costs vary depending on suppliers. The bills for Thames Water's customer have gone up from £488 to £639 a year on average.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82pm40915o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4c6d/live/d88269a0-9f54-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-02T15:10:32.199000+00:00,2e80f5f6a2e5d09ca3cad9c487787e968644a5db

But more than a year later she has not received any of the money - despite using a government scheme set up to tackle employment tribunal non-payments. And she's not alone. Of the 7,000 people who have used this scheme, three quarters still haven't had their payment, data revealed as part of an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. A government spokesperson said the system was set up by its predecessors and ""every worker should receive payments they are owed"". Nadine told the BBC that taking the company she worked for, Peckham Levels Ltd, to a tribunal was ""probably the worst experience of my life"". Both sides told the BBC they made offers to settle, but the case went to a full hearing and Nadine was awarded £28,750 for detrimental treatment, £35,250 for unfair dismissal plus a compensatory award of £915. Weeks after the judgement, Peckham Levels Ltd went into administration, leaving Nadine with no way to recover her award. ""I've lost my sense of joy,"" she says. ""When you get told by a judge that you have suffered detriment, and you still can't receive that money – it kind of makes it worse,"" she says. The former director of Peckham Levels, Preston Benson, is currently the director of 12 businesses. In a statement, he said the distress the case had caused Nadine was ""deeply regrettable"". Mr Benson pointed out that he had ""no legal ability"" to pay the award once the company was in administration. No employers named The Employment Tribunal Penalty Enforcement and Naming Scheme was set up by the Conservative government in 2016, after a 2013 survey of 1,200 claimants found that more than a third hadn't received any money at all. Under the free scheme, companies face a penalty if they don't pay within 28 days, and since 2018 they can also be named online by the government. But of around 7,000 people who have used the scheme, more than 5,000 did not receive their payment or settlement, data from a Freedom of Information request suggests. The data indicates that despite more than 4,800 penalties being issued, with a combined value of more than £9m, the government only recorded 109 as being paid. It also suggests not a single employer has so far been named by the government for non-payment, despite nearly 4,000 requests being made. Rosie Davies now wishes she 'hadn't bothered' with the tribunal system Rosie Davies was awarded £6,000 in unpaid wages and breach of contract at an employment tribunal after she lost her job in motorsports. But 18 months later, she says she is ""still waiting for a penny of that money"". Claimants can also pursue their awards through the High Court – but the government doesn't track how many are successful. Rosie used both schemes to try to get her award from her employer, Christian Elvidge, who runs production company Motorflix Ltd. He hired Rosie through a separate firm – Motorflix Media Ltd. She was the only employee. Mr Elvidge was sent penalty notices and High Court enforcement officers also went to his house. But Rosie says that when Mr Elvidge declared Motorflix Media Ltd had no assets, he wasn't pursued further. The company is still registered, but has yet to file any accounts. 'The life I was making I no longer have' As well as the stress of going through the tribunal, Rosie says not getting the money ""tipped things over the edge"" for her finances, and she moved back in with her mum. ""I feel like I've gone back five years,"" she says. ""The life I was making for myself I no longer have."" Rosie applied to have her employer named online too – but hasn't been successful. She now wishes she ""hadn't bothered"" with the tribunal system. ""I thought the justice system would step in and make sure I received that money,"" she says. Christian Elvidge was contacted for comment, but did not respond. 'Completely broken' system Tens of thousands of employment tribunal cases are launched every year – although the vast majority are settled, withdrawn or resolved before it gets to a hearing. 491,000 claims were open in March 2025, according to the Ministry of Justice. Citizens Advice said the employment tribunal system was ""completely broken"". ""To have jumped through all of those hoops and then have a tribunal award that never gets paid is frankly scandalous,"" said policy manager Emer Sheehy. The Federation of Small Businesses is among those calling for the system to be ""overhauled"". Tribunals can be costly for businesses as well as employees, said policy director Tina McKenzie. ""There's currently more than a year's waiting list, and if the government brings in the reforms its proposing, it's going to get a lot worse,"" she says. She said the most common reason an award from an employment tribunal isn't paid is that the company becomes insolvent – something she says has been a particular issue in the post-pandemic years covered by the data. People who run limited companies are not personally liable for that company's debts. The FSB's Tina McKenzie says it's ""not ok"" that some people miss out on their awards – but argues that she isn't surprised when ""500,000 business have closed over the last four to five years"". She thinks there could be a case for a ""central UK pot"" that pays out those who are owed a tribunal award when a company becomes insolvent. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise it requires improvement as we intend to strengthen enforcement of unpaid awards as part of the Plan for Change.""

a81b62e73c9a,'My pay is being held hostage': Federal workers on US government shutdown,,"US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being ""held hostage"". Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts. A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits. What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending. BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them. Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named. ""The last shutdown was brutal"", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month. He added: ""It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills."" The same worker said: ""I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us."" Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: ""Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown."" He explained: ""The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained."" Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was ""rather conflicted"" and did not mind a break from the ""gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat"" of a mass firing. She said she would ""support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will"". Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: ""I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues."" He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was ""facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever"". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency. An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: ""I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL"". A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party. ""I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,"" she said.

2968f7b48176,Shein picks France to open its first permanent outlets,,"Asian fast-fashion giant Shein has chosen France as the location to open its first permanent physical outlets. It will occupy concessions in department stores first in Paris, followed by five others in the cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges. Shein told the BBC on Thursday that France's ""influential global fashion market"" was a ""natural choice"" as the firm's testbed for physical stores. The fashion brand has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions. The company has previously opened temporary pop-up stores in cities such as Madrid and Paris, but has never operated a permanent physical shop. The new outlets are being opened through a partnership with retail property group Societe des Grands Magasins (SGM). The French company runs the BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette department stores that will house what Shein calls ""shop-in-shop"" outlets. The outlets will create an estimated 200 jobs in France, Shein said in a statement, adding that the collaboration aimed to revitalise city centres and department stores in the country. ""By choosing France as the place to trial physical retail, Shein aims to benefit French customers and the wider retail sector,"" the firm said. This comes after the French Senate adopted a bill in June to regulate the fast-fashion industry by sanctioning companies, such as Shein and rival Temu, and banning their adverts. Shein, which ships to more than 150 countries, has primarily operated online through its website and app. Founded in China in 2008 and headquartered in Singapore, Shein has come under scrutiny over its production of fast-fashion goods . The business model rapidly produces low-cost clothes based on the latest styles, but has drawn criticism for its environmental impact. Concerns have also been raised about the working conditions within Shein's supply chain.

f82daf714245,White House says layoffs 'imminent' with no end to shutdown in sight,,"White House says layoffs 'imminent' with no end to shutdown in sight Watch: Federal worker layoffs to be ""in the thousands"" during shutdown, says White House Mass layoffs of US federal workers are ""imminent"" and could result in people permanently losing their jobs within days, the White House says, as a government shutdown continues for a second day. Lawmakers are trading blame over the shutdown - the first for almost seven years - under which thousands of workers have been put on unpaid leave. US President Donald Trump has called on Republican allies to use it as an ""opportunity"" to make more lasting cuts. The shutdown began on Wednesday, after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to agree a new spending plan. There is little sign of either side compromising and the next vote to try and end the situation will not be held until Friday. The Senate is currently adjourned, raising fears that the situation could drag on and threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as risk costing the US economy billions in lost output. At a White House briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Vice-President JD Vance made a rare appearance alongside Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt to accuse opposition Democrats of playing political games. ""If they are so worried about the effect this is having on the American people, and they should be, what they should do is reopen the government, not complain about how we respond,"" he said. Leavitt, meanwhile, indicated that mass job cuts could happen before the end of the week. Pressed by reporters about timeframes, she said ""two days, imminent, very soon"" and promised further updates. ""Sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to do,"" Leavitt explained, adding that ""Democrats put us in this position"". Trump previously warned that a prolonged shutdown could present him the opportunity to make irreversible cuts to ""Democrat things"". He wrote on his Truth Social site on Wednesday evening: ""Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud. Billions of Dollars can be saved."" His administration announced the same day that $18bn (£14bn) would be withheld for infrastructure projects in New York City - the home city of the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. Vance's comments represent the latest dig in what has been a bitter blame game between both parties, with the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer earlier accusing Republicans of trying to ""bully"" them into accepting a funding plan. Democrats want to secure guarantees on healthcare funding before they agree to a spending deal, while Republicans want to use a temporary stop-gap measure to keep the government open until mid-November and funded at current levels. Schumer and his allies say they allowed the government to shut down in an attempt to negotiate to save healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans. They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful. ""Why are they boycotting negotiations? I've never witnessed this in my life,"" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said of Republicans. ""The matter is the government will open when Republicans get serious about it talking to Democrats."" Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down Meanwhile, Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass a funding bill - have said these healthcare benefits are not the priority, keeping the government open is. ""It's not about who wins or who loses or who gets blamed and all this,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “It's about the American people. And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically."" Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist. Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave. In the past, these workers have then been paid retrospectively. Watch: Vance makes rare appearance at White House briefing Analysts expect this shutdown to happen on a larger scale than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills. They anticipate that roughly 40% of federal workers - around 750,000 people - will be put on temporary leave. Some workers were furloughed on Wednesday. At the White House, Vance reiterated the threat of permanent layoffs of federal workers. ""Let's be honest, if this thing drags on, we are going to have to lay people off,"" he said. Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown was a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants. US law already prohibits undocumented migrants from gaining any federally subsidised healthcare coverage. ""Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, briefed Republicans behind closed doors on what the impending layoffs could look like, although public details of those plans are sparse. On Capitol Hill, there was little appetite for a deal to end the standoff on Wednesday. ""There's nothing to negotiate. There's nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,"" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. Another vote on the short-term funding bill proposed by Republicans is expected on Friday.

add63874bb8d,Baroness Mone-linked company ordered to pay £122m over PPE contract,,"Baroness Mone-linked company ordered to pay £122m over PPE contract Rachel Clun Business reporter Getty Images A company linked to peer Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman has been ordered to pay £122m in damages after a judge ruled it breached a government contract for the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the Covid pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care sued PPE Medpro over claims the medical gowns it supplied did not comply with relevant healthcare standards. The High Court ruled Medpro failed to prove whether or not its surgical gowns, which were to be used by NHS workers, had undergone a validated sterilisation process. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it was beyond her powers for Baroness Mone to be stripped of her peerage. But speaking to Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live, Reeves said: ""I hope she won't be back in the House of Lords."" Peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. While a life peerage cannot be relinquished, Baroness Mone could choose to resign from being a member of the House of Lords. Reeves said she would ""do everything"" in her power ""to get that money back"" and that the money belongs ""in our schools, in our hospitals and in our communities"". During the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the government scrambled to secure supplies of PPE as the country went into lockdown and hospitals across the country were reporting shortages of clothing and accessories to protect medics from the virus. In May that year, PPE Medpro was set up by a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman, and won its first government contract to supply masks through a so-called VIP lane after being recommended by Baroness Mone. The judgement said the government later ordered 25 million sterile gowns from Medpro, which were delivered in August and October 2020, after being manufactured in China. However, just before Christmas that year, the Department of Health served the company with a notice rejecting the gowns and asking for a refund. The judgement said the government decided it was ""not satisfied that the gowns were contractually compliant"" after inspecting them, and claimed subsequent tests conducted found ""a number of them were not sterile"". Paul Stanley KC, representing the government, told the trial that of 140 gowns that were tested, 103 failed. It led to the government launching legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. Medpro, however, argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. Having previously denied gaining directly from the contracts, Baroness Mone, a former Conservative peer and lingerie tycoon, admitted in December 2023 that she stood to benefit from tens of millions of pounds of profit. She also admitted to the BBC that she and her husband lied about their involvement with Medpro to avoid ""press intrusion"". The court found firm's director Anthony Page called on his ""big gun"" - Baroness Mone - during negotiations in order to secure the gown contract. In the court ruling on Wednesday, Justice Cockerill said the contract between Medpro and the government was ""complex"", but found that the company did in fact have to demonstrate it had undertaken a ""validated sterilisation process"". ""That was not complied with by Medpro,"" she said. ""It followed that Medpro had breached the contract."" The ruling also said the gowns lacked the ""notified body number"" required to mark them as sterilised, and that Medpro had provided no evidence such a process had taken place. Medpro had also argued that the government could have sold the gowns if it no longer wanted them, or repurposed to be used as non-sterile or isolation gowns. During the case, the company said any lack of sterility or valid sterility marking ""did not prevent the said gowns from being used within the NHS or from being sold to third parties outside of the EU"". Justice Cockerill said there were problems with that argument, including the fact that the NHS did not need any more isolation gowns. However, she noted that the DHSC did not effectively reject the gowns within a reasonable timeframe, and also dismissed the government's claim for £8.65m in storage costs over lack of evidence. The judge ruled the company must pay £121,999,219 in damages, plus interest, however, it remains unclear how Medpro will pay the fee, with the company appointing administrators the day before the court decision. Its last set of accounts said it only had £666,025 of shareholders' funds. The court said the firm had until 15 October to pay the damages to the government. Speaking after the judgement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government was working with administrators and ""all different authorities"" to try and claim the money. 'A win for the establishment' In response to the ruling, Baroness Mone said it was ""shocking but all too predictable"". ""It is nothing less than an Establishment win for the Government in a case that was too big for them to lose,"" she said in a social media post. A spokesperson for Mr Barrowman described the ruling as ""a travesty of justice"". ""[Mrs Justice Cockerill's]  judgment bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month-long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile,"" the spokesperson added. Baroness Mone was once described as one of the UK's most successful businesswomen, creating the gel-padded Ultimo bra in the late 1990s. In 2015, then-Prime Minister David Cameron made her the government's ""entrepreneurship tsar"", and shortly after she became a Conservative peer. The next year she announced she was in a relationship with Mr Barrowman, a billionaire businessman who founded The Knocks Group of Companies and was a director of Aston Management Limited. In December 2022, Baroness Mone sought a leave of absence from the House of Lords. Neither Baroness Mone nor Mr Barrowman appeared in court for the decision. A separate National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation into Medpro was launched in May 2021, into suspected criminal offences committed over the procurement of PPE. An NCA spokesperson said on Wednesday its investigation was ongoing.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1792rk7ynko,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4f30/live/60a20e90-9ec3-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-01T14:38:45.659000+00:00,badb5e2aa029580f3d1e2926a38d140a0ad96670

61ec5905de15,"Greggs set to raise prices again in response to cost pressures, says CEO",,"Greggs set to raise prices again in response to cost pressures, says CEO Josh Martin Business reporter Getty Images Greggs will raise its prices for the third time this year from tomorrow High street baker Greggs is set to raise the price of its breakfast meal deals and biscuits in response to growing cost pressures, the company's chief executive has said. Roisin Currie said the price increases would kick in from Thursday. She said the action was being taken in response to increased staffing costs, including the impact of an unexpected £20m increase in the amount it pays in employer National Insurance as a result of last year's Budget. It will be the third time this year that the sausage roll maker has raised prices, mirroring a wider trend on the UK high street. Both the two-part and three-part breakfast deal will increase by 20p each to £3.15 and £4.15p, respectively. The Greggs' boss said other price rises across other lines, like its biscuits would only be about 5p. Greggs' famous sausage roll will be unaffected in this round of price hikes, having already increased to £1.30 earlier this year. In August, Tesco increased its meal deal price by 25p, while coffee chain Costa has also increased hot drink prices this year. Despite these latest menu increases, Greggs remained ""the cheapest by far of all the other major high street coffee and sandwich shops"" such as Costa or Pret, Rathbones senior investment director Laura Lambie said. ""I suspect their customers are a lot more price-conscious so cannot withstand major hikes, "" she added. The baker chain will continue to open stores, and Ms Currie said there were opportunities to build more Greggs outlets in retail parks, roadside services as well as ""compelling opportunities"" to push further into southern England. ""Some were querying 'have we reached peak Greggs?' and we have gone out...to demonstrate that this is not the case,"" she said. Greggs has more than 3,000 shops across the UK. It plans to open a net 120 sites in 2025. Bracing for the Budget The bakery boss said she expected price pressures on the business to ease next year, but that the upcoming Budget could change that assumption. ""What's not helpful is when something comes out that surprises us - that's what happened with the National Insurance last year...it's quite hard to plan and manage a business when you have a £20m hit that you hadn't predicted,"" Ms Currie said. Last year's Budget included an increase in employer National Insurance aimed at raising £25bn for the government, which faced criticism from businesses . Ms Currie pointed to potential increases to the minimum wage as another reason why cost pressures and price rises may continue.

02f3f0765400,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned",,"'Buy one, get one free' deals for unhealthy food banned Nick Triggle Health correspondent AFP via Getty Images Price or multibuy promotions on unhealthy food and drink, such as ""buy one, get one free"" deals, are to be banned in England from Wednesday. The restrictions will apply to supermarkets, larger high street shops and online retailers. The measure has been under consideration for years but has been put off because of the cost-of-living crisis. Ministers argue the restrictions are an important step to tackle obesity – and in particular childhood obesity. The regulations also ban free refill promotions of certain drinks in restaurants and cafes. It will be followed by a ban on the advertising of less healthy food and drink on television before 21:00 and a complete ban on online promotions from January. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said the restrictions were a ""crucial step"" in giving children a healthy, happy start in life. ""Obesity robs children of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems and costs the NHS billions."" The government has introduced a classification system to define what food and drinks are classed as unhealthy, which is based on the products thought to have most influence on child obesity. So, in terms of drinks it includes fizzy drinks such as lemonade and cola that contain sugar. And for food it covers everything from crisps, sweets and chocolates to ice creams, pastries, cakes, and some fishfingers and pizzas. What difference will it make? Obesity rates have risen sharply over recent decades, with more than a quarter of adults and a fifth of children at the end of primary school classed as obese. Greg Fell, president of the Association of Public Health Directors, said this move should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"", but said it was long overdue, arguing it should not have been delayed from 2022 in the first place. ""Multi-buy promotions do not save people money – in fact, they encourage them to spend more. ""They are designed to encourage impulsive purchases and to normalise buying more and more frequently."" He said he hoped retailers would now turn towards promoting healthy products more, to make healthier choices easier and more accessible. Obesity rates had risen at an unprecedented rate over the years and were now a ""key driver"" of health inequalities as people in more deprived areas were nearly twice as likely to be obese, Mr Fell added. ""These are a long-overdue first step, but the government is far away from meeting its manifesto commitment to end junk food advertising to kids."" In particular he said there needed to be a tightening of restrictions on sponsorship of sporting and leisure events, as well as wider society investment to promote active travel and improve the quality of food in schools. There is evidence to suggest restrictions on the promotion and sale of unhealthy products can have an impact. A University of Leeds study published earlier this year looked at the impact of the one measure introduced in 2022 as planned – the ban on selling unhealthy products at key locations, such as checkouts, aisle ends and store entrances. Before the ban, 20 out of every 100 items sold were what was classed as unhealthy, while after that it dropped to 19. The researchers said this worked out at two million fewer products per day. Although it was also noted there was a downward trend for the sale of these products before the legislation was introduced and high rates of inflation could also have had an impact. There has been industry lobbying of government against the restrictions over the years. But some retailers, including Sainsbury's and Tesco, introduced their own restrictions some time ago. And Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, from the British Retail Consortium, said the vast majority of his members were already now compliant. ""There will not be a big change for them. ""Food retailers are supporting their customers to make healthier choices through better calorie labelling, reformulation of products, and portion control."" Wales is introducing similar restrictions next year and Scotland has said it will follow suit. Former prime minister Boris Johnson first announced a UK-wide ban on TV adverts for food high in sugar, salt and fat before 21:00 to help tackle the problem in 2021. The ban was later delayed to 2025, with the Conservative government saying it wanted to give the food and drink industry time to prepare for the change because of the cost of living crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d54gv44qo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d446/live/7365eac0-9e40-11f0-b0fc-395f3bc1ac43.jpg,2025-10-01T06:00:54.932000+00:00,ddadc3ba7ca1a0491aedec471bd261eee162b1b0
e2ef0115557b,Hurricane season brings financial fears in the Caribbean,,"Hurricane season brings financial fears in the Caribbean Gemma Handy Business reporter, St Johns, Antigua Getty Images Homes in Barbuda were flattened by 2017's Hurricane Irma For some Barbudans, thunderstorms still trigger flashbacks of the night in September 2017 when they lost everything they owned to Hurricane Irma's devastating winds . Eight years on, while memories may be close to hand, home insurance for many on Barbuda and other islands in the Caribbean's hurricane belt is more prohibitively expensive than ever. Across the region premiums have gone through the roof in the past two years, surging by as much as 40% on some islands, according to industry figures. Experts blame a perfect storm of increasing risk – as the region sees worsening and more rapidly intensifying cyclones – yet tiny populations of people to pay for policies, equating to poor returns for insurance companies. Dwight Benjamin's Barbuda home was one of few left relatively undamaged by Irma. After the storm, he invested in a one-room extension topped with a concrete roof that will serve as a shelter for his family should disaster strike again. ""I think the house should be sound enough but that's my added protection,"" he says. With peak hurricane season now in full swing, Dwight is among many Caribbean people anxiously monitoring weather platforms for activity in the Atlantic. Should a system head his way, he will do as he did during Irma – hope and pray. ""I've never had insurance; most Barbudans don't really think it's worth it. It's just an added expense to the meagre resources we have,"" he explains. ""Plus, we believe in what we have built and that it should be able to withstand the weather."" Courtesy Dwight Benjamin Dwight Benjamin built an extension to his home which serves as a shelter during hurricanes Like Dwight, many Caribbean people build homes ""out of pocket"", rather than opting for mortgages that can have high interest rates in this part of the world. And the majority of homes on islands affected by hurricanes are uninsured. In Jamaica only 20% are reported to have cover, and just half in Barbados. It is not just storms threatening the region, but earthquakes and volcanos too, points out Peter Levy, boss of Jamaican insurance company BCIC. As a result of these threats of natural disaster, which Mr Levy calls the Caribbean's ""unique market"", the cost of home insurance will always be high. One Antiguan insurance firm, Anjo, typically charges premiums of between 1.3% and 1.7% of a home's value. Whereas in the UK, for example, it can be less than 0.2%. Getty Images Hurricane Irma, pictured, is the most powerful storm to have hit Barbuda since records began The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November, with the most activity occurring between mid-August and mid-October. The northern Caribbean nations, such as Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, and the Dominican Republic, are among the most at risk of a direct hit. The peak months can be torturous for people with Irma-related trauma, says Mohammid Walbrook, another Barbudan resident. ""Whenever there's an announcement of a storm coming our way, it brings back bad memories. For some, even thunder and lightning are a trigger,"" he says. Back in 2017, Mohammid took shelter in a bathroom with his mother, father, sister and nephews when Irma's category five winds tore the roof from his parents' home. His own uninsured two-bedroom property was also badly damaged. He was one of several Barbudans to receive a new house through assistance from international donors. Courtesy Mohammid Walbrook Mohammid Walbrook survived Hurricane Irma While some Caribbean countries - like British territory Turks and Caicos, also battered by Irma - have emergency cash reserves that can help with post-storm restoration, others do not have that luxury. For deeply indebted nation Antigua and Barbuda, agencies like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are a lifeline in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The country's prime minister Gaston Browne estimated the cost of rebuilding Barbuda after Irma, where 90% of buildings were damaged, topped $200m (£148m). Help came from China, the European Union and Venezuela, among others. In 2017, the UNDP stumped up $25m for Barbuda and the island country of Dominica, which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria that same month. The money restored more than 800 wrecked buildings across the two islands. But the body's intervention was crucial in other ways too. With livelihoods destroyed, the UNDP's cash-for-work programme hired hundreds of local residents who had suddenly found themselves unemployed. They assisted with everything from debris removal to reconstruction of homes and infrastructure, including Barbuda's hospital and post office, the UNDP's Luis Gamarra tells the BBC. ""Injecting economic resources into affected families helps reactivate the local economy,"" he says. Almost 1,000 contractors were also trained in more resilient ""build back better"" techniques, to safeguard structures against future disasters. ""The climate is changing and putting more pressure on governments and communities. Storms are becoming more frequent, more intense and happening earlier in the year too,"" Mr Gamarra continues. He thinks the expansion of partnerships with the private sector and with other countries in the region might help mitigate the impacts. One such mechanism is the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, of which 19 Caribbean governments are members. Set up after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the first-of-its-kind risk-pooling venture allows member governments to buy disaster coverage at low cost. Last year it made record payments topping $85m to Hurricane Beryl-hit islands. In Antigua and Barbuda, hurricane preparedness is a year-round endeavour, explains Sherrod James, director of the country's office of disaster services. Assessments of buildings to be used as storm shelters, along with training of volunteers to man them, starts months before the season starts, he says. ""We also meet with the private sector, helping them put policies and preparations in place, looking at the safety and resilience of their buildings. We make sure our critical partners, such as the ports, are prepared. ""And we do a lot of proactive work to address chokepoints within waterways that can exacerbate flooding,"" adds Mr James. ""These days, storms can go from a category one to five in a day. The new norm has thrown out the old regiment of what has to be done; we have to be much more proactive now."" For many Barbudans, this time of year will always bring trepidation. Dwight was among dozens who recently attended a Hurricane Irma remembrance service at the island's Pentecostal Church. ""It was very touching and brought back a lot of memories,"" he says. ""This time of year, we keep an eye on the weather and our fingers crossed. But we are resilient people and we know how to survive.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lxvjypxreo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6dfc/live/2a9d06a0-9951-11f0-9ab8-fd188b933226.jpg,2025-10-01T23:02:08.200000+00:00,0d796a3a8446cd5cb78b882988af2d29b6b1d1b2

Indeed, they are some of the most picturesque examples in the Netherlands, and easy to get to from Amsterdam. Last year, 2.6 million people visited - a gigantic amount for a small place with a resident population of just 100. It is far too many tourists, says the local council. And so, it has announced that from next spring it will charge every visitor from outside the area €17.50 ($20.50; £15) to enter, to try to control the numbers. It's very rare for a community to take such a measure, but talking to Marieke Verweij, director of the village's museum, you can understand why they want to do this. ""In 2017 we had 1.7 million visitors… this year we're heading for 2.8 million,"" she says. ""But this is a small place! We just don't have room for all these people!"" Worse, says Marieke Verweij, visitors often ""don't know that people live here so they walk into their gardens, they walk into their houses, they pee into their gardens, they knock on doors, they take pictures, they use selfie sticks to peek into the houses. So no privacy at all."" I leave the museum and walk past a coach car park in the general direction of the windmills. I probably shouldn't say this, as it's just going to make the problem worse, but these are some fabulous windmills. One of them is wooden and painted green. Another has thatched walls. Every so often the wind picks up and their sails go round. It's a fine sight - and one most people would want to get a picture with. A lot of people are doing just that, of course. The windmills are actually still quite a long way off but, at the best spots, visitors form very civilised selfie-queues. There's a bit of a queue also at a little bridge that leads over a canal towards the windmills. As I edge forward I hear Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian and Russian. The plan is to get everyone to book and pay online. The sort of thing you often have to do now to visit museums post-Covid. The sweetener for tourists is that for the €17.50 they get admission to two things they currently have to pay for separately anyway – entry to the museum and to the inside of the windmills. The former contains a painting of the local windmills by French impressionist Claude Monet, who visited in 1871. In the latter you can see how, in the 17th Century, the Dutch were using windmills not just to grind grain, but to do things like grind pigments to make paint or saw wood. The villagers complain of people walking into their homes If only half the current numbers keep visiting after the admission charge is introduced, annual revenues will be around €24.5m. The council plans to spend the money on maintenance of the windmills and on new infrastructure. New toilets, for example. But the shop and restaurant owners are not happy at all. The stores, it should be said, are a bit of an attraction in themselves. The staff wear traditional costumes in the cheese shop, they do clog-making demonstrations in the shoe store. And they are located inside old and beautiful wooden houses. The antique and gift shop for example, dates from 1623. The planned entrance charge is threatening the livelihoods of Zaanse Schans's retailers and restaurant-owners, says Sterre Schaap. She co-runs the gift shop, which is called Trash and Treasures. ""It's awful. It will mean that people who don't have a big wallet won't be able to come here,"" says Ms Schaap. ""It will mean that we will lose a lot of our shoppers. ""If you're with a family of four and you have parking, it will be around €100. So people won't have a lot of budget over for other stuff."" The village shops, where staff wear traditional outfits, fear a big drop in business I wander up to the windmills, past a young woman who's photographing her friend, and a couple from Germany who are taking a selfie. Up on the balcony of one of the windmills, looking out at the impressive flatness of Holland, I get talking to Ishan from Canada. ""I don't know if I'd pay the €17.50 to come here. It's a bit steep just to see a couple of windmills,"" he says. But Elisia, who is Albanian, grew up in Greece, and now lives in the Netherlands, says she would definitely pay that amount. ""These villages, they are not so big and they lose their charm when there are so many tourists,"" she says. Steve, who's over with his family from Massachusetts in the US, has been doing his calculations and can see the good side of the upcoming charge. ""Cheap people like me,"" says Steve, ""look at the windmill and say 'nah, I'm not gonna pay extra to go in there', but if it's all included I wouldn't hesitate."" It'd be a more complete experience, he says, and not a bad deal. John Laurenson Will the number of selfies go down when people have to pay to get into the village? The deal is also a sign of the times. Rachel Dodds, a professor of tourism at Canada's Toronto Metropolitan University, points out a few comparable cases. ""Bhutan charges an entry fee per day to visit the country. Venice, of course, is probably the most famous one with €5 for day trippers,"" she says. Meanwhile, the US and the UK both charge travel authorisation or visa fees for foreign nationals to visit them. Yet villages that charge entrance fees are still very rare. Current other examples are the privately owned fishing village of Clovelly in Devon, England, the medieval Civita de Bagnoregio and Corenno Plinio in Italy, and Penglipuran in Bali, Indonesia. As I wait for my bus to leave Zaanse Schans, a bus load of people arrive, swiping their credit cards to pay for their rides. Those who arrive in a few months time will be digging around for pre-paid entry tickets, too.

When US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last Friday to add a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applications for H-1B visas, a programme for skilled foreign workers, Abhishek Singh immediately worried he would have to relocate. Mr Singh, a software engineering manager based in the Seattle area, knew that his employer - a US startup - would not be in a position to pay the fee on top of his current salary. Mr Singh, who has been working in the US for ten years - the last seven of them on a H-1B visa - breathed a slight sigh of relief when the White House clarified on Saturday that for now, the fee only applies to future applicants. But his worries are an indication of the potentially far-reaching consequences of the change, as it creates new burdens for businesses, especially startups, with what some say could be significant fallout for innovation and economic growth. Abhishek Singh Abhishek Singh, a software engineering manager based in the Seattle area, has been working in the US on a H-1B visa for the past seven years. The H-1B programme is often associated with the giants of the US tech sector. Amazon tops the list of beneficiaries, with more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025. Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google each secured more than 4,000 visas through the programme through June. None of the companies responded to requests for comment. But while just 30 employers  - mainly big tech companies - dominate the programme, accounting for an estimated 40% of the new H-1B visas available , it is not just the behemoths that are poised to be affected by Trump's executive order. Startups, as well as smaller firms beyond tech, also employ workers through H-1B visas. For them, a six-figure fee per applicant could be crippling. ""If you're a startup with new technology, and you've got some venture capital money but you're worried about burning through it too quickly, this could kill you,"" said John Skrentny, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies STEM workforce development. ""What the Trump administration's plan doesn't seem to acknowledge is that not every company can spend $100,000 on a visa,"" he added. Beyond the technology industry, organisations in industries such as education and healthcare, both of which employ foreign skilled workers through the H-1B programme, are also grappling with what the six-figure fee might mean. ""There's no way that we can afford $100,000,"" said Karen Brady, the chief executive at Ryther, a behavioural health nonprofit based in Seattle. ""In terms of future hiring, we won't be doing any more H-1B visas."" The behavioural health sector has been grappling with a workforce shortage amid a spike in need since the pandemic, Ms Brady said. Hiring employees through the H-1B programme has helped address the crisis, she said. Ryther, based in Seattle, currently employs two therapists on H-1B visas, out of 45 total, Ms Brady said, both of whom are from China. Without those employees, there would be nobody on staff with the linguistic and cultural knowledge to communicate with families from similar backgrounds. ""They match some of our clients in a way that American workers don't,"" she said. ""I can't replace that."" Reuters In a research note, Atakan Bakiskan, an economist at the investment bank Berenberg, lowered his estimate for US growth from 2% at the start of the year to 1.5%, saying said the $100,000 H-1B fee is part of the Trump administration's broader ""anti-growth policymaking"". ""With the new H-1B policy, the labour force is more likely to shrink than expand going forward,"" he said. ""The brain drain will weigh heavily on productivity."" 'A great solution' In his executive order, Trump justified the new fee by referring to ""abuse"" of the H-1B programme, a nod to longstanding concern across the political spectrum that companies have used the programme to hire foreign staff at lower wages. His administration is also working on a wider overhaul of the programme, which is typically overwhelmed by applications for the roughly 85,000 new visas available each year, including a proposal to prioritise applications for higher paid workers. Trump's initial announcement won praise from some, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who broke from many of his fellow tech leaders, calling the fee a ""great solution"". Supporters of the change have said the major tech companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, that are the biggest beneficiaries of the programme, have the money to swallow the new charge. ""If these are really specialised people, and they're bringing in a lot of value, $100,000 shouldn't be a big deal for those employers,"" said Ronil Hira, a political science professor at Howard University who focuses on US immigration policy. But policies that make it harder for companies to hire skilled positions also often prompt firms to offshore their operations, rather than hire US workers at an equivalent skill level, said Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School focused on global migration and entrepreneurship. ""These policies really don't have the intended effect of balancing the labour market competitiveness of American workers,"" Prof Wang said. ""There's not a trace of data that suggests that American workers would benefit from this."" Elise Fialkowski is co-chair of the corporate immigration practice at Klasko Immigration Law Partners, which works with both startups and larger corporations. She said since last week, some of her larger corporate clients - many of which already have subsidiaries or branch offices outside the US - have started to ponder whether to hire talent in Canada, the UK and elsewhere instead. Trump's executive order ""almost begs companies to offshore work"", she said. Despite the reprieve, Mr Singh said he was still considering leaving his startup if he could find a job in his home country of India, or elsewhere - Canada, Japan, South Korea - worried the administration will continue to harden policies against immigrants. ""There's uncertainty now that anything can happen in the future,"" Mr Singh said. ""If we are forced out, then that's the only option we're left with.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzrl9kkkmo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bb12/live/828acbd0-996b-11f0-80b9-69e2e45f1309.jpg,2025-09-25T00:11:05.193000+00:00,e63fdd5ba9e61473a47e0b32fc4c5bc64b4c6791
fbb8069d46cf,Zimbabwe is tobacco country. But some think the future lies in blueberries,,"Zimbabwe is tobacco country. But some think the future lies in blueberries Shingai Nyoka / BBC Zimbabwe is Africa's biggest producer of tobacco but some farmers believe the country's long-term future could lie in a very different crop - blueberries. Thanks to a breakthrough in trade talks with China, the world's biggest importer of the nutrient-rich fruit, Zimbabwe has taken a major step towards achieving its ambition of becoming Africa's blueberry capital. Tobacco sales surged to a record $1.3bn (£1bn) last year, helped by the rising number of smokers in China. In contrast, blueberry exports were worth a more modest $30m but horticulture specialist Clarence Mwale is undaunted. ""The future is food, not a bad habit,"" he tells the BBC at his warehouse in Harare. For the first time, China has agreed to import Zimbabwean blueberries and, crucially, has exempted them from tariffs, in a boost for the southern African state's struggling economy. ""We have to strike while the iron is hot,"" exuberant blueberry farmer Alistair Campbell tells the BBC. Currently exporting to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia, farmers like Campbell would be gaining access to a massive new market, once Zimbabwe passes China's compliance tests on pest and disease control. A former captain of Zimbabwe's cricket team, 53-year-old Campbell co-owns a high-tech 50 hectare (123 acres) blueberry farm about an hour from the capital, Harare. Each of the 240,000 plants on the farm is grown in a pot imported from the Netherlands or South Africa. The pot soil is also imported. The plants are watered eight times a day, with specially treated water, and the blueberries are kept in refrigerators soon after they are harvested to maintain freshness. Campbell said that although it was a demanding fruit to grow, the rewards are worth it, especially as global demand is increasing for what some describe as a superfood, with high levels of vitamins and anti-oxidants. Campbell believes Zimbabwe can cash in on the rising demand, as the fruit comes into season early, in late March, hitting the market ahead of major competitors like Peru. ""It's all about Peru avoidance,"" laughs Campbell. Peru is both a bitter rival and an inspiration for Zimbabwe's farmers. In the last 10 to 15 years, it has gone from being responsible for less than 2% of global blueberry production to becoming the largest exporter of the fruit. Zimbabwe's production this year is expected to rise by 50% to 12,000 tonnes. Morocco currently leads Africa's production with more than 80,000 tonnes in 2024. South Africa, Zimbabwe's neighbour, produced 25,000 tonnes. With South Africa being severely hit by US tariffs, it is looking for new markets for its fruit, with China being an obvious one, especially as it has promised zero tariffs for all African states, except Eswatini because of its close ties with Taiwan. The Washington Post via Getty Images Blueberries have become increasingly popular because of their health benefits China has not yet agreed to take South African blueberries , raising hopes among farmers in Zimbabwe that they will enter the lucrative market first. The Zimbabwean and Chinese governments struck the deal earlier this month, offering what has been described as an ""unprecedented opportunity for local producers to access one of the world's fastest-growing blueberry markets"" . ""This agreement is a milestone for Zimbabwe's horticultural sector,"" says Zimbabwe's Horticultural Development Council executive director Linda Nielsen. ""We now need collaboration to design policies that increase investment, boost production, and ensure our blueberries meet China's strict quality and phytosanitary standards,"" she adds. Zimbabwe farmers are now looking for capital to boost blueberry production to 30,000 tonnes by 2030. Expressing caution about whether this can be achieved, Campbell tells the BBC: ""It's all good saying Zimbabwe is open for business but the underlying fundamentals need to be correct."" Many analysts say that more than 20 years after the government's controversial land reform programme led to the seizure of many white-owned farms, investors remain uncertain about the security of their land, despite a new law that does away with leases and offers full title to resettled farmers. With Zimbabwe experiencing a severe cash crisis, exporters are required to surrender almost a third of their foreign-currency earnings to the central bank in exchange for local currency - something that many Zimbabweans are loathe to do, fearing it will lose its value. Last year Zimbabwe generated $30m (£22.5m) from blueberry exports. The amount may be modest, but with unemployment high, the jobs the industry creates are welcome. It employs about 6,000 people, mostly women. Shingai Nyoka / BBC Rebecca Bonzo says blueberry farms are a source of employment for women ""It's delicate hands that are needed for a delicate fruit,"" Rebecca Bonzo, a supervisor at Campbell's farm, tells the BBC in the Shona language. ""Up to 300 women work during the peak harvesting season. Many are sole breadwinners who can now take care of their families,"" she says. Clarence Mwale - the founder of Kuminda, which represents a collective of small- and medium-scale farmers - says he is pushing more of them to become involved in blueberry farming. He says he has achieved this with other crops - for instance, about 5,000 small-scale farmers now supply horticultural products, mainly mange touts and sugar snap peas, to the UK and other European markets, something that was unheard of 15 to 20 years ago. Mwale says he is now looking for about 100 young farmers to diversify into blueberry farming and benefit from China's decision to open the market to Zimbabweans. ""As the Chinese market opens up…it gives us much more scope,"" he tells the BBC. ""Where we were scrambling and fighting for the European markets, which we haven't been able to fulfil, now we have a vast market that we have to fill. ""It gives everyone a chance to get into the blueberry production."" Zimbabwe has traditionally been tobacco country. But having fuelled a bad habit in China, it now wants to promote a health food there, hoping in the process to acquire the status of Africa's blueberry capital.

7807bacf5537,Global conflicts drive demand for war risk insurance,,"Global conflicts drive demand for war risk insurance Padraig Belton Business reporter Alina Kalcheva Natalia Grishko's balcony, top right, was badly damaged by the blast from a Russian missile With conflict continuing in Ukraine and the Middle East, a little-explored global industry has never been more in demand – the war risk insurance market. When a Russian missile damaged Natalia Grishko's apartment in a tower block on the outskirts of Kyiv last November she thankfully was not injured. Mrs Grishko's daughter, Alina Kalcheva, says the missile fell about 100m (328ft) from the building. ""The blast wave damaged my mother's balcony, windows, doors, and the interior of the apartment."" While her mum was ""of course very upset and cried"" to begin with, Mrs Kalcheva says she ultimately felt calm because they had insured the flat against such an attack. For while general household insurance doesn't cover conflict damage – whether you live in Ukraine or a country not under attack - Mrs Kalcheva had had the foresight to take out specialist war risk insurance cover for her mother. And the insurer paid out $1,000 (£740) to help cover the repairs. The annual premium or cost was $52, and the 33-year-old says she ""didn't hesitate to buy it. And as it turned out it was obviously the right decision."" Fellow Ukrainian Ekaterina Vasylieva even took out a war risk policy for her car in April 2024. That was particularly timely, because only a day later her vehicle was damaged by Russian shrapnel when it was parked in a street in the coastal city of Odesa. ""Only the day before I extended the comprehensive insurance on the car, and the manager offered for me to get insurance against military risks,"" she says. ""The cover saved me a lot because after the Russian attack the car looked like a sieve."" Alina Kalcheva Alina Kalcheva, pictured here with her husband and children, had taken war risk insurance out for her mother War risk insurance is the general term for a sector that also offers cover against terrorism. Industry experts say it has grown exponentially since the September 11 attacks in the US back in 2001. And while individuals can take out war risk cover, the vast majority of policies are bought by companies who wish to insure their operations, facilities and staff around the world. Especially in high-risk countries and regions. Although data is hard to come by for an industry that doesn't seek the limelight, one trade publication this year estimated that the global amount spent on taking out war risk insurance now totals about $1bn (£800m) per annum. And £621m, or nearly 80%, of that figure is said to go to specialist insurers in the City of London, which is the centre of the international war risk insurance market. Joanna Cousins heads a nine-person political violence and war team at one such London-based insurer – Westfield Specialty. She cites the example of a large energy facility in Iraq, owned by a Western company, which has been attacked multiple times in recent years. Mrs Cousins says that the owner ultimately bought more than £100m of war risk cover, without which it would have ""ceased or greatly reduced"" the operation of the site. People in the war risk market are not normally very keen to talk about how much a policy costs. But for a British or American company operating in Lebanon or Israel, ""currently, premiums are priced between 0.5% and 2% of the total cover they buy,"" says a senior London war risk insurance underwriter who asked not to be named. An underwriter is a finance professional who determines the level of risk of an insurance application, and then calculates what the cost of the cover will be. The 0.5% to 2% range means that if a business wants £100m of annual cover it has to pay between £500,000 and £2m. However, these rates will ""fluctuate significantly as the situation in different countries in the Middle East is volatile"", adds the unnamed underwriter. Premiums in stable Gulf states are said to be much lower, from 0.025% to 0.05% of the total amount covered. What is actually covered by a policy can vary. For example, a company can get cover for kidnappings and ransoms, treating serious injuries, or the cost of dealing with an ""active assailant"" situation. ""The market is growing in capacity and demand, "" says Daniel Hiller, underwriter, and group head of terrorism and political violence at insurer Munich Re Specialty. ""There are more perils customers can buy coverage for, especially around the active shooter product, but also strikes and riots."" Getty Images Conflicts in the Ukraine and Middle East have increased focus on war risk insurance Getty Images The City of London is the centre of the global war risk insurance sector War risk cover is organised in seven ""buckets"" spanning different severities of conflict. Sabotage and terrorism are considered to be the lowest, while civil and interstate war are the highest. ""Many insurers try to offer all this coverage, since often it's not clear where a situation has moved from risk of terrorism, to civil war, to even interstate war,"" says Raveem Ismail, founder of specialist insurance firm London-based Trigger Parametric. The war risk sector is centred on London due to the continuing strength of Lloyds of London, which has been a specialist insurance market since 1689. Lloyds is also home to war risk insurance reinsurers – firms who buy and sell the cover. Ms Cousins says this spreads out the possible exposure. ""Each [reinsurer] covers a certain percentage of the risk, of anywhere between one and 10%,"" she says. Constantin Gurdgiev, a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado, and an expert in the study of risk and conflict finance, says the challenge for the war risk sector is to work out what premium to charge for cover. ""Wars and conflicts more generally represent black swan [very rare] events,"" he says. Because of this rarity, he adds that ""historical data tends to be a weak basis for establishing any priceable insights"". Yet Mr Ismail points out that war risk insurance can be very profitable, something he contrasts with the car insurance sector. ""As a car insurer, for every £1 of premiums you take in, you pay back almost £1.05 in claims,"" he says. You might think that the maths doesn't add up there, but Dr Ismail says that the car insurers make the 5p and more from investment income. By contrast, war risk insurance funds can pay out as little as 2% . Put simply, car crashes remain far more common than war damage.

There are a number of steps you can take: secure any loose objects outside your property such as bins, ladders, trampolines and outdoor games, garden furniture and tools check fences and roof tiles are secure clear guttering of debris such as moss and leaves if possible, remove any loose or overhanging branches close and fasten external doors and windows secure storm shutters, if they are fitted to your home or business park vehicles in a garage, if you have one; otherwise ensure they are as far away as possible from buildings, trees and fences close and secure loft trapdoors make sure you know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water in case you have to leave your home, for example because of flooding charge mobile phones and any other critical devices including battery packs gather essential documents such as passports and driving licences, and make sure you have contact and policy details for your insurance company if you take medication, make sure you have a few days' supply If you are in a flood-risk area , try to move valuable or essential items upstairs or store them as high as you can on the ground floor. What should you do during a storm? Strong winds can cause damage to buildings, such as tiles coming off roofs, and heavy rain can lead to flooding. Public transport may be disrupted. People are advised to stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed. Unplug any non-essential electrical items in case of power surges. If you do have to go out, you should avoid walking next to buildings, trees and the sheltered side of walls or fences, in case of collapse. You should not attempt to repair any damage to your property or possessions while a storm is in progress. The RSPCA advises bringing all animals inside and ensuring you have sufficient food, bedding and fresh water. Listen out for bad weather warnings on local radio and TV, and check government and news websites for the latest updates. In you become trapped by floodwater, you should go to the highest level of the building you are in. Avoid attic spaces due to the risk of being trapped by rising water, and only go onto the roof if absolutely necessary. Call 999 and wait for help. What should you do if there is a power cut? If you lose electricity you make sure all non-essential appliances are switched off, but leave a light on so you know when the supply returns. You can report a power cut online or by calling 105, which is a free service in England, Scotland and Wales. Alternatively, you can find the details of your energy network operator by using this postcode search tool .

A survey completed by 1,250 people in Jersey showed 95% found the affordability of childcare was poor or very poor and 79% said there were not enough places. Ministers have announced plans to invest £4m in childcare but nursery owners have expressed concerns about the cost and the lack of staff to deliver it. Education Minister deputy Rob Ward, who published the survey, said ""evidence is clear that the cost of childcare is a real barrier for families"" and he was committed to making it more affordable and accessible. The research was commissioned for the government's Early Years Common Strategic Policy for the 2024 to 2026 period. The findings showed the three main barriers to being able to access childcare were affordability, availability and flexibility. It also found enabling employment and supporting child development were the two key motivators for parents and carers. Ward said the report would help the government shape a system that ""gives every child the best start in life"". ""As minister, this is something I care deeply about,"" he said. ""I have listened to parents and carers across Jersey and I recognise the challenges they face.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylw73wpezo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e801/live/d3c64f40-9fa3-11f0-8e4d-7723b0da5e04.jpg,2025-10-02T17:52:36.053000+00:00,3173ea07fd079310dd0c0dfca39fb8865e2fca13
f583afe14909,When is the Budget and what might be in it?,,"When is the Budget and what might be in it? Reuters The Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her plans for the economy when she delivers the Budget on 26 November. Before the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. But in her speech at the Labour Party Conference in September, Reeves appeared to suggest tax rises were a possibility, talking of tough decisions ""in the coming months"" . What is the Budget? The chancellor of the exchequer's Budget statement outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on health, schools, police and other public services. The statement is made to MPs in the House of Commons. Further details about Budget measures - and what they cost - are published by the Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors government spending, also publishes its assessment of the health of the UK economy and a forecast of what it thinks will happen in the future. What time is the Budget and what happens afterwards? The Budget speech usually starts at about 12:30 UK time - after Prime Minister's Questions - and lasts for about an hour. It will be broadcast live on the BBC iPlayer and on the BBC News website. The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will respond to the speech in the House of Commons. MPs will then debate the measures for four days, before voting on them. If approved by MPs, tax changes can come into effect immediately. However, the government must pass a finance bill to make them permanent. What might be in the Budget? There is lots of speculation that Reeves will have to break Labour's manifesto promise and raise taxes in the Budget because she needs more money to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances. Reeves has two main ""fiscal"" rules, which she says are ""non-negotiable"": Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament However, in its last report in March , the OBR said the chancellor only had a £10bn buffer to meet these rules, which it called a ""very small margin"". Since then the government has U-turned on planned benefit cuts that had aimed to save billions, while the cost of government borrowing has increased. Income Tax and National Insurance The government could extend the current freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028. Freezing the thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax or qualify for higher rates. This is often referred to as a ""stealth tax"". Speaking to the BBC in September, Reeves did not rule out extending the freeze. The Resolution Foundation think tank - which has close links to some members of the government - says some personal taxes will have to rise. As part of a package of measures, it recommended cutting 2p from the employee NI rate while adding the same amount to income tax. Such a move would potentially affect pensioners, landlords and the self-employed more than workers, as their tax would increase but they don't pay that rate of NI so wouldn't benefit from the matched cut. Value Added Tax (VAT) The Sunday Times reported that the government was considering scrapping VAT on domestic fuel bills - cutting the current 5% rate to zero. Health Secretary Wes Streeting ruled out introducing VAT on private healthcare . Property taxes Reports suggest the government may reform property taxes . This could include replacing stamp duty - a tax buyers pay on properties above a certain value in England and Northern Ireland - with a property tax. Landlords could have to pay more taxes, and council tax could be replaced. Some people selling their main residence may have to pay capital gains tax (CGT). Youth employment guarantee In September Reeves said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months will be given paid placements to help them secure full-time employment . More details are expected in the Budget. Isa reform In July, the chancellor ruled out any immediate reform to cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts). There had been speculation that she wanted to reduce the annual allowance to push people into investing in shares instead, to help boost economic growth. Other measures to encourage such investment are considered more likely. Pension changes There has also been speculation about possible changes to pension rules, such as the level of tax relief available to savers and the size of the cash lump sum which can be withdrawn. Cutting the higher rate tax relief on pension contributions would save the Treasury money, but may make pension savings less attractive. Business taxes The TUC, the umbrella group for trade unions in the UK, has called for higher taxes on online gaming companies and on banks' profits . How is the UK economy doing? The Labour government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority. A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. The latest official figures show that growth in the UK economy has slowed in recent months. The economy was flat in July , after increasing by 0.4% in June. Looking at the longer term trend, the economy grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, down from the 0.3% growth in the three months to June, and the 0.6% growth seen between March and May. In August, UK government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - hit £18bn, the highest level seen for the month in five years , driven by higher spending on public services, benefits and debt interest. Meanwhile prices in the shops are still rising faster than wanted. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - was 3.8% in the year to August , the same as in July, which is above the Bank of England's 2% target. In August the Bank cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year, taking the cost of borrowing to the lowest level for more than two years. It cut because of concerns that the jobs market was weakening,  with data showing job vacancies were continuing to fall and wage growth was slowing. However, the Bank held rates at its next meeting in September , arguing the UK was ""not out of the woods"" on inflation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w44w42j5o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8376/live/c5070a20-96b3-11ef-99af-372359b57a36.png,2025-10-02T13:10:05.084000+00:00,0078c0e8f3015efd228af9eab4e4e836700a6b51
df0e0fd4cc5e,Food bank volunteer proud to be praised by PM,,"A 79-year-old food bank volunteer has called being singled out for praise by the prime minister this week ""one of the proudest moments of my life"". George Sutherland, from Telford, has worked for Telford Crisis Support for the past 10 years and said: ""Demand has gone through the roof."" His work was recognised by Sir Keir Starmer in his speech at the Labour Party conference on Tuesday after his name was put forward by the town's MP, Shaun Davies. Mr Sutherland said he enjoyed the work he did and added: ""It's my happy place where I feel I'm helping people that have got less than I've got."" Mr Sutherland, who was also nominated by Telford Crisis Support, said he was invited to sit on the front row at the conference in Liverpool and he got to listen to some of the speeches. He also met lots of other volunteers, who he said were ""all similar people with the community at the heart of everything"". In his speech, Starmer mentioned Mr Sutherland alongside several other volunteers and described him as a person who ""delivers food parcels in Telford with a smile"". Mr Sutherland said the experience was ""absolutely wonderful"" and ""one of the greatest things that's ever happened to me outside of my marriage and my children"". But he also said ""this is not for me, this is for the Crisis Support"", adding he was ""no different from the person that started a few weeks ago"". Davies, the Labour MP for Telford, said on his Facebook page: ""George is amongst the best of us and why I'm proud of our town and proud of our country. ""His commitment has made a real difference locally and I was delighted to hear him named today."" Reflecting on the last year at Telford Crisis Support, Mr Sutherland said: ""It's getting harder as the cost of food is going up people are finding they've got less and less surplus money to spend and to give food to other people."" But he said his message to those in need was: ""If you need help don't feel ashamed to ask.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yqrq5ke7po,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/81ad/live/54239ee0-9f86-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-02T05:26:55.099000+00:00,406d1d9d0e7681dc9d3e0e890580bb8bc51da784
796a2f6086cd,Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning,,"Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning James Landale Diplomatic correspondent BBC Listen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago. Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

4a67eeee64ff,The UK car industry is at a tipping point - can it be saved?,,"The UK car industry is at a tipping point - can it be saved? Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs. Behind it, the production line came to a halt – forever. The Luton plant began building cars in 1905. It kept operating for the next 120 years, taking time out to build tanks and aircraft engines during World War Two. But on 28 March, that came to an end. The factory shut down, a victim of cutbacks at Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis. Justin Nicholls, a production shift manager, was one of the 1,100 workers there - he had worked at the plant for 38 years. ""It was devastating, because it came out of the blue"", he says. ""It was a complete surprise."" It followed the closure of Honda's car factory in Swindon in 2021, and Ford's engine plant in Bridgend the year before. Together, they have come to symbolise an apparent long-term decline in the UK motor industry. Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images Vauxhall's Luton plant has been building cars since 1905 until production stopped earlier this year In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953. Output for the year is expected to be around 755,000 vehicles — lower even than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, described the situation as ""depressing"". The sector contributes some £22bn a year to the economy, according to the SMMT, and as recently as 2023 automotive manufacturing employed some 198,000 people in the UK. Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale. ""There is a critical mass of employment,"" he explains. ""Once you go below that, you see it all fall apart. ""You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on."" And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges. ""If we think about parts of the UK that have automotive plants, they're often disadvantaged regions,"" says David Bailey, professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School. ""Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy."" He is concerned about what has already been lost. ""I'd argue that actually we've let too much of this go already. I think once it's gone, it's really gone."" The question is, can the industry recover - or is it too late? A concealed deeper problem The UK car industry is sprawling. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers. In 2016, the UK produced 1.82m new vehicles – more than at any point since 1999.  Yet even at that point, storm clouds were already gathering. And the industry has suffered further over the past decade. Factory closures have had an impact, but other factors have been at play as well, including uncertainty over US trade policy, which has hit exports to a major market. Then there was the role of Brexit. Adam Vaughan/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the UK's leading manufacturers, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has deliberately moved upmarket in recent years, meaning it now sells fewer cars - also contributing to the lower figure of UK car production ""Obviously, Brexit had a big impact"", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. ""It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility."" As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles. The agreement with the EU to guarantee continued tariff-free trade soothed the industry's concerns when it came. But by then, there was another challenge to contend with. The pandemic caused havoc within the industry globally. In 2020, output dropped by nearly a third, hitting levels not seen since the mid-1980s. It also threw finely tuned global supply chains out of kilter and created shortages of vital parts. Although demand for new cars was spiking, manufacturers simply couldn't build them quickly enough. Reuters/ Chris Radburn 'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry. Quite simply, it has become an expensive place to build cars. Part of this is to do with labour costs. Although lower than in some other Western European countries, particularly Germany, they are around twice the level seen in Central European nations such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Then, there are energy costs. British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world. ""Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production,"" explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics. The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency. The investments starting to bear fruit When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year. A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production. Of those who have not relocated, some retired. ""[Others] are taking quite a reduction in pay"", says Gary Reay, who was a representative of the Unite union at the plant. The factory site has been bought by a property firm, Goodman - it plans to create more than 1,700 jobs at a new industrial park. Mr Reay is unimpressed. ""The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers."" Toby Melville/PA Wire Just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025 Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit. In 2024, for example, Nissan stopped building its ageing electric Leaf model at its Sunderland plant — having previously been building about 30,000 a year. But it is due to begin making a new version this year and will start building an electric version of the Juke in 2026. Nissan is also one of the manufacturers set to benefit from investments in gigafactories. Nissan's battery partner AESC is building one in Sunderland, which will be able to make power packs for 100,000 electric vehicles a year. JLR's parent company, Tata, meanwhile, is investing in its own plant in Somerset, through its subsidiary Agratas. The government says it wants to increase the number of cars and commercial vehicles built annually to 1.3m by 2035. The SMMT believes 803,000 vehicles will leave the production lines next year but bringing that up to 1.3m looks like a very tall order, according to Mike Hawes. Greg McDonald, the CEO of Goodfish Group, is also circumspect. ""I don't think many people think there's going to be a resurgence,"" he says. His business makes injection moulded components for carmakers and has four sites across the UK. It also has a base in Slovakia. ""Suppliers like us are used to being constantly bid at for price and cost reductions, and there's a limit to how much you can do."" Diversifying or Chinese investment? One way of mitigating this is for businesses to diversify - something more viable for smaller businesses in the sector. Burnett's Manufacturing, based in Northampton, is one of many automotive suppliers clustered around the Midlands Corridor. A manufacturer of specialist rubber and plastic parts, it relies on the motor industry for about 40% of its business. But it also provides components for shipbuilders and oil and gas firms. According to technical sales manager, Rich Dixon, smaller companies are more flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances. ""I think we're lucky in some ways, because 60% of our business is diversified across many different industries,"" he says. ""The last thing you want to be is 100% automotive. ""The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive."" Yang Dong/VCG via Getty Images Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market. ""If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry,"" argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies. This would, he adds, require significant government action, including negotiations with Beijing. The question is, is it already too late? One senior executive, who has spent decades in the European industry, doesn't believe the UK will become a major player in the EV market. ""I don't think governments have spent the necessary time and energy preparing for the shift to EVs. Chris J. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images The UK is home to a number of luxury car firms, such as Bentley ""I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in,"" says the executive, who asked not to be named. ""It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand."" Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars. This could mean becoming a hub for the production of luxury Chinese designs, while allowing cheaper mass-market models to be built elsewhere. ""I think people globally are willing to pay a premium for a British-made luxury car,"" adds Prof Bailey. The Great British 'brain drain' There is plenty at stake here, and it goes beyond the impact on local communities when factories are lost or suppliers stop trading. ""I also worry about it in terms of impacts on productivity, exports, and research and development,"" says Prof Bailey. ""Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go."" This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. ""We tend not to support our homegrown industries in the same way that other countries do"". What is harder to assess is the loss of national prestige. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry. This became even more marked when MG – a classic British brand – became a boutique badge for cars made in China. Bloomberg via Getty Images ‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’ Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. Think of Rolls Royce, Bentley, McLaren and Lotus. Even BMW-Mini, a mass market manufacturer, is more than willing to wave the Union Jack – or rather, have it painted on door mirrors and roofs. If those cars were no longer built in Britain, it might well be perceived as a national humiliation. And for some, the decline of the auto industry would almost certainly be perceived as a symptom of a much wider loss. ""I do think people are [becoming] much more aware of where things are made,"" argues Mr Fowler. ""This isn't necessarily a nationalistic thing, but more a sustainability thing. Do you want your car to have travelled halfway around the world to reach you?"" Ultimately, he says, there is already ""a bit of a brain drain of talent, because the opportunities, bluntly, aren't here in the UK. ""[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else.""

95dccc61b996,Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price,,"Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent and Dharshini David Deputy economics editor BBC In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs – only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic. Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered. At least, so far. Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases. Whether that turns out to be the case – and whether these actions will have negative consequences – is still very much in doubt. What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe. And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term. The '90 deals in 90 days' deadline For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs. While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted ""90 deals in 90 days"" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was. By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/Pool The baseline 10% applied to most British goods raised eyebrows at first – but was a relief compared to the 15% rate on other trading partners The UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK. While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone. And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs. South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt ""thank you for your attention to this matter"". Capacity to 'damage' the global economy Much has been revealed as a result of this. First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised. JOHN G MABANGLO/EPA/Shutterstock The greatest fears - the warnings of potential disaster - have receded Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse. For better, in the sense that businesses are able to make plans, investment and hiring decisions that had been paused may now be resumed. Most exporters know what size tariffs their goods face – and can figure out how to accommodate or pass on the cost to consumers. That growing sense of certainty underpins a more relaxed mood in financial markets, with shares in the US notably gaining. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein Trump hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals equated with tearing down trade barriers in the past But it's for the worse, in the sense that the typical tariff for selling into the US is higher than before – and more extreme than analysts predicted just six months ago. Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU – but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades. The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have receded. But Ben May, Director of global macro forecasting at Oxford Economics, says that US tariffs had the capacity to ""damage"" the global economy in several ways. ""They are obviously raising prices in the US and squeezing household incomes,"" he says, adding that the policies would also reduce demand around the world if the world's largest economy ends up importing fewer goods. Winners and losers: Germany, India and China It's not just about the size of tariff, but the scale of trading relationship with the US. So while India potentially faces tariffs of over 25% on its exports to the US, economists at Capital Economics reckon that, with US demand accounting for just 2% of that nation's gross domestic product, the immediate impact on growth could be minor. The news is not so good for Germany, though, where the 15% tariffs could knock more than half a percentage point off growth this year, compared to what was expected earlier in the year. That's due to the size of its automotive sector - unhelpful for an economy that may be teetering on the brink of recession. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US recently, after fears of what may lie in store for China Meanwhile, India became the top source of smartphones sold in the US in the last few months, after fears of what may lie in store for China prompted Apple to shift production. On the other hand, India will be mindful that the likes of Vietnam and the Philippines – which face lower tariffs when selling to the US – may become relatively more attractive suppliers in other industries. Across the board, however, there's relief that the blow, at least, is likely to be less extensive than might have been. But what has been decided already points to longer-term ramifications for global trading patterns and alliances elsewhere. And the element of jeopardy introduced into a long-established major relationship with the US, lent added momentum to the UK's pursuit of closer ties with the EU – and getting a trade deal with India over the line. For many countries, this has served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances. A very real political threat for Trump? As details are nailed down, the implications for the US economy become clearer too. Growth in the late spring there actually benefitted from a flurry of export sales, as businesses rushed to beat any higher tariffs imposed on American goods. Economists expect that growth to lose momentum over the rest of the year. Tariffs that have increased from an average of 2% at the beginning of the year to around 17% now have had a notable impact on US government revenue – one of the stated goals of Trump's trade policy. Import duties have brought in more than $100bn so far this year - about 5% of US federal revenue, compared to around 2% in past years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected tariff revenue this year to total about $300bn. By comparison, federal income taxes bring in around $2.5tn a year. American shoppers remain in the front line, and have yet to see higher prices passed on in full. But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them. Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain. Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval. It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections. The deals yet to be hammered out Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry. The colossal issue of China, subject to a different deadline, remains unresolved. Trump agreed to a negotiating extension with Mexico, another major US trading partner, on Thursday morning. Many of the deals that have been struck have been verbal, as yet unsigned. Moreover it is uncertain if and how the strings attached to Trump's agreements – more money to be spent purchasing American energy or invested in America – will actually be delivered on. In some cases, foreign leaders have denied the existence of provisions touted by the president. YURI GRIPAS/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Trump's overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success When it comes to assessing tariff agreements between the White House and various countries, says Mr May, the ""devil is in the detail"" – and the details are light. It's clear, however, that the world has shifted back from the brink of a ruinous trade war. Now, as nations grapple with a new set of trade barriers, Trump aims to call the shots. But history tells us that his overarching aim - to return production and jobs to America – may meet with very limited success. And America's long-time trading partners, like Canada and the EU, could start looking to form economic and political connections that bypass what they no longer view as a reliable economic ally. Trump may be benefitting from the leverage afforded by America's unique position at the centre of a global trading order that it spent more than half a century establishing. If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, however, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US. Those questions will be answered over years, not weeks or months. In the meantime, Trump's own voters may still have to pick up the tab – through higher prices, less choice and slower growth. Additional reporting: Michael Race.

431b4f0ce0b4,"Labour might be down, but it's not necessarily out - voters reflect on a year in power",,"Labour might be down, but it's not necessarily out - voters reflect on a year in power Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""There's only one relationship that really matters,"" a senior figure in government told me in the middle of Labour's dreadful week, where ministers lost control of their backbenchers. ""It's the one with the voters."" Well, quite. And that relationship has soured since Labour has been in power. After days of frenzied coverage in Westminster around an anniversary the party might rather forget, what is the state of that vital relationship? We gathered a group of Labour's 2024 voters together to delve into what's gone wrong, according to those who matter the most – the public. Our participants were from two constituencies in Kent: Dartford and Gravesham. Both seats were won by Labour in the heady days of July 2024, thanks not only to Labour's campaign itself, but the collapse of the Conservative vote. And the swing to Sir Keir Starmer's party in both places was enormous, nearly 20%. Our panel was selected by the political research group, More in Common, and the questions were asked to the group not by me, but by its director, Luke Tryl. Jack Hill/The Times/PA Wire It's worth knowing too, when our panel was recruited, they were not told they would be asked about politics. It could have been for any other market research exercise, for washing powder or water bills, rather than anything to do with Westminster - so it wasn't a gathering of political junkies. But our group, who all voted Labour last time, certainly had a strong sense of what has happened to the government they elected just twelve months ago, and it wasn't pretty. First of all, we asked the group about their impressions of Labour's first year back in office, overall. The overwhelming sense, and one of the words used most often, was ""disappointed"". From top left (L-R): Yvette, Kirsty, Ramesh, Hayley. On the bottom row (L-R): Adam, Veronica, Kelly and Sodiq ""I've always been Labour, but I expected much more from them,"" Yvette, who's 57 and a nutritionist said. ""I thought they'd be there for the people."" Kelly is 35, and a stay-at-home mum. She was frustrated about what she sees as a lack of progress on immigration. ""Everything they promised, nothing has come of it yet,"" Kelly said. ""Immigration is a big thing for me."" Adam, is an illustrator aged 37. He was a bit more forgiving of Sir Keir's problems: ""They are patching things up, the first year is not the year to push the big ideas, let's steady the ship."" But 30-year-old Sodiq, who owns his own business, reckons Labour hadn't been completely straight about what its plans were to start with. ""I think a lot of the things that were promised were never going to happen,"" Sodiq said. Kirsty, who's 35 and a teacher, even told us, ""I feel lied to"". House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire What about the chaos of Parliament this week, and Labour's many changes of direction since they've been in office? The group had definitely noticed what had gone on in the last seven days, not always the case when it comes to shenanigans in SW1. Veronica, a 64-year-old carer, had seen the chancellor's tears and had some sympathy. ""I think she's trying her best - there are going to be teething problems, it's only the first year."" But she said, ""crying at the Commons the other day and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did? Sometimes I think, 'Is it the pressure getting to her?'"". Hayley, who is a personal assistant, was also dubious that Sir Keir didn't notice, but reckons the government deserves more time. ""You can't turn the country round in a year,"" the 40-year-old said. But it was clear the group had reservations about Labour's repeated shifts in position - whether on welfare this week, or winter fuel before. While praising Sir Keir for listening, Adam said: ""What happened this week - another U-turn - was worrying, it pushes the idea that there is no direction."" Yvette said ""if he makes a decision he should stand by it"", changes of heart were like ""lastminute.com"". Jacob King/PA Wire In the general election there were big shifts towards Reform UK, even though they didn't win either the Dartford or Gravesham seat. But Kent was one of the 10 councils Farage's party took control of in the local elections this May. Reform's progress has certainly been noticed. Kelly said: ""They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive."" Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round. ""If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,"" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though ""a lot of bad things are said about him"". Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire But Sodiq said: ""I'm at the other end of the scale. He's a politician, like others, who says things people want to hear, and people generally are not comfortable with the two main parties, and just want to try something else."" Labour is worried by their grisly position in the polls, and there's something of a sense of bewilderment too about just how shaky things have got in the last few weeks. But at senior levels, sources believe if they keep on keeping on, eventually, many voters like those we met this weekend will return to them if hopes for improvements in the NHS and the economy come to pass. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Watch tomorrow to hear the advice that our group would give Sir Keir Starmer in order to improve, to make that happen. Of course this is only a taste of what's on some voter's minds in just  two constituencies, but the mood was certainly disappointed with what has, and has not happened since Labour moved back into power. But there was a sense, a grudging willingness among these Labour voters to give Sir Keir and the government more time. After twelve months, Labour is most certainly down, but not necessarily out.

b35a5827e0be,China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost?,,"China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost? Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC Listen to Theo read this article In China, they call it the Seagull, and it has looks to match. It is sleek and angular, with bright, downward-slanting headlights that have more than a hint of mischievous eyes about them. It is, of course, a car. A very small one, designed as a cheap city runabout – but it could have huge significance. Available in China since 2023, where it has proved extremely popular, it has just been launched in Europe with the name Dolphin Surf (because Europeans apparently aren't as keen on seagulls as Chinese people). When it goes on sale in the UK this week, it's expected to have a price tag of around £18,000. That will still make it, for an electric car on western markets, very cheap indeed. It won't be the outright lowest-priced model on offer: the Dacia Spring, manufactured in Wuhan jointly by Renault and Dongfeng, and the Leapmotor T03, which is being produced by a joint venture between Chinese startup Leapmotor and Stellantis, both cost less. But the Dolphin Surf is the new arrival that has long-established brands most worried. That is because the company behind it has been making ever bigger waves on international markets. Bloomberg via Getty The BYD Dolphin Surf will be priced at around £18,000 in the UK - ultra cheap for an EV BYD is already the biggest player in China. It overtook Tesla in 2024 to become the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs), and since entering the European markets two years ago, it has expanded aggressively. ""We want to be number one in the British market within 10 years,"" says Steve Beattie, sales and marketing director for BYD UK. BYD is part of a wider expansion of Chinese companies and brands that some believe could change the face of the global motor industry – and which has already prompted radical action from the US government and the EU. It means once-unknown marques like Nio, Xpeng, Zeekr or Omoda could become every bit as much household names as Ford or Volkswagen. They will join classic brands such as MG, Volvo and Lotus, which have been under Chinese ownership for years. The products on offer already encompass a huge range, from runabouts like the tiny Dolphin Surf to exotic supercars, like the pothole-jumping U9, from BYD's high-end sub-brand Yangwang. ""Chinese brands are making massive inroads into the European market,"" says David Bailey, professor of business and economics at Birmingham Business School. In 2024, 17 million battery and plug-in hybrid cars were sold worldwide, 11 million of those in China. Chinese brands, meanwhile, had 10% of global EV and plug-in hybrid sales outside their home country, according to the consultancy Rho Motion. That figure is only expected to grow. For consumers, it should be good news – leading to more high-quality and affordable electric cars becoming available. But with rivalry between Beijing and western powers showing no sign of subsiding, some experts are concerned Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk from hackers and third parties. And for established players in Europe, it represents a formidable challenge to their historic dominance. ""[China has] a huge cost advantage through economies of scale and battery technology. European manufacturers have fallen well behind,"" warns Mr Bailey. ""Unless they wake up very quickly and catch up, they could be wiped out."" Cut-throat competition in China China's car industry has been developing rapidly since the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But that process accelerated rapidly in 2015, when the Communist Party introduced its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative. The 10-year plan to make the country a leader in several high-tech industries, including EVs, attracted intense criticism from abroad, and particularly the US, amid claims of forced technology transfers and theft of intellectual property – all of which the Chinese government denies. Fuelled by lavish state funding, the plan helped lay the groundwork for the breakneck growth of companies like BYD – originally a maker of batteries for mobile phones – and allowed the Chinese parent companies of MG and Volvo, SAIC and Geely, to become major players in the EV market. ""The general standard of Chinese cars is very, very high indeed,"" says Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK. ""China has learned extremely quickly how to manufacture cars."" Yet competition in China has become ever more cut-throat, with brands jostling for space in an increasingly saturated market. This has led them to hunt for sales elsewhere. While Chinese firms have expanded into East Asia and South America, for years the European market proved a tough nut to crack – that is, until governments here decided to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models. The transition to electric cars opened the door to new players. ""[Chinese brands] have seen an opportunity to get a bit of a foothold,"" says Oliver Lowe, UK product manager of Omoda and Jaecoo, two sub brands of the Chinese giant Chery. STR via Getty BYD overtook Tesla in 2024 to become the world's biggest-selling EV manufacturer Low labour costs in China, coupled with government subsidies and a very well-established supply chain, have given Chinese firms advantages, their rivals have claimed. A report from the Swiss bank UBS, published in late 2023, suggested that BYD alone was able to build cars 25% more cheaply than western competitors. Chinese firms deny the playing field is uneven. Xpeng's vice chairman Brian Gu told the BBC at the Paris Motor Show in 2024 that his company is competitive ""because we have fought tooth and nail through the most competitive market in the world"". 'Naked protectionism' from the US? Concerns that Chinese EV imports could flood international markets at the expense of established manufacturers reached fever pitch in 2024. In the US, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned they could prove to be an ""extinction-level event"" for the US industry, while the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen suggested that ""huge state subsidies"" for Chinese firms were distorting the European market. The Biden administration took dramatic action, raising import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs from 25% to 100%, effectively making it pointless to sell them in the US. It was condemned by Beijing as ""naked protectionism"". REUTERS/Leah Millis The Biden administration raised import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to 100% in 2024 Meanwhile, in October 2024, the EU imposed extra tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese-made EVs. The UK, however, took no action. Matthias Schmidt, founder of Schmidt Automotive Research, says the EU's tariffs have now made it harder for Chinese firms to gain market share. ""The door was wide open in 2024... but the Chinese failed to take their chance. With the tariffs in place, Chinese manufacturers are now unable to push their cost advantage onto European consumers."" Renault's ultra-modern EV hub European manufacturers have been racing to develop their own affordable electric cars. French car-maker Renault is among them. At its factory in Douai, in northeastern France, an army of spark-spitting robots weld sections of steel to form car bodies, while on the main assembly line, automated systems mate together bodyshells, doors, batteries, motors and other parts, before human workers apply the finishing touches. The factory has been making cars for Renault since 1974, but four years ago, the ageing production lines were replaced with new highly automated, digitally-controlled systems. Part of the site was also taken over by the Chinese-owned battery firm AESC, which built its own ""gigafactory"" next door. Renault This Renault plant is adopting production techniques used by some Chinese manufacturers It's part of Renault's wider plan to set up an ultra-modern EV ""hub"" in northern France. Mirroring the lean production techniques of Chinese manufacturers, the hub cuts costs by maximising efficiency and ensuring that suppliers are located as close as possible. ""Our target was to be able to produce affordable electric cars here to sell in Europe,"" explains Pierre Andrieux, director of the Douai plant, arguing that automated processes ""will enable us to do that profitably"". But the company is also exploiting something the Chinese brands do not have: heritage. Its latest model, the Renault 5 E-tech, built in Douai, borrows its name from one of the company's most famous products. Getty Images and Renault The original Renault 5 - which the new Renault 5 E-Tech emulates - became a cult classic The original Renault 5, launched in 1972, was a quirky little everyman car with boxy looks and low running costs that became a cult classic. The new design, despite being a state-of-the art EV, pays homage to its predecessor in name and appearance, in an effort to emulate its popular appeal. Security, spyware and hacking concerns But irrespective of how desirable Chinese cars are in comparison with European rivals, some experts believe we should be wary of them – for security reasons. Most modern vehicles are internet-enabled in some way – to allow satellite navigation, for example – and drivers' phones are often connected to car systems. Pioneered by Tesla, so-called ""over-the-air updates"" can upgrade a car's software remotely. This has all led to concerns, in some quarters, that cars could be hacked and used to harbour spyware, monitor individuals or even be immobilised at the touch of a keyboard. Getty Images Tesla pioneered ""over-the-air updates"" allowing software to be updated remotely Earlier this year, a British newspaper reported that military and intelligence chiefs had been ordered not to discuss official business while riding in EVs; it was also alleged that cars with Chinese components had been banned from sensitive military sites. Then in May, a former head of the intelligence service MI6 claimed that Chinese-made technology in a range of products, including cars, could be controlled and programmed remotely. Sir Richard Dearlove warned MPs that there was the potential to ""immobilise London"". Beijing has always denied all accusations of espionage. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London says that the recent allegations are ""entirely unfounded and absurd"". ""China has consistently advocated the secure, open, and rules-based development of global supply chains,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""Chinese enterprises operating around the world are required to comply with local laws and regulations. ""To date, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Chinese EVs pose a security threat to the UK or any other country."" Chinese government is 'not hell-bent on surveillance' Joseph Jarnecki, research fellow at defence and security think-tank The Royal United Services Institute, argues that potential risks can be mitigated. ""Chinese carmakers exist in this highly competitive market. While they're beholden to Chinese law and that may require compliance with national security agencies, none of them want to damage their ability to grow and to have international exports by being perceived as a security risk,"" he says. ""The Chinese government equally is conscious of the need for economic growth. They're not hell-bent on solely conducting surveillance."" But the car industry is just one area in which Chinese technology is becoming increasingly enmeshed in the UK economy. To achieve the government's climate objectives, for instance, ""It will be necessary to use Chinese-supplied technology"", adds Mr Jarnecki. He believes that regulators of key industries should be given sufficient resources to monitor cyber security and advise companies using Chinese products of any potential issues. As for electric cars powered by Chinese technology, there's no question that they're here to stay. ""Even if you have a car that's made in Germany or elsewhere, it probably contains quite a few Chinese components,"" says Dan Caesar. ""The reality is most of us have smartphones and things from China, from the US, from Korea, without really giving it a second thought. So I do think there's some fearmongering going on about what the Chinese are capable of. ""I think we have to face the reality that China is going to be a big part of the future.""

a96354175d36,The true extent of cyber attacks on UK business - and the weak spots that allow them to happen,,"The true extent of cyber attacks on UK business - and the weak spots that allow them to happen Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent BBC The first day of September should have marked the beginning of one of the busiest periods of the year for Jaguar Land Rover. It was a Monday, and the release of new 75 series number plates was expected to produce a surge in demand from eager car buyers. At factories in Solihull and Halewood, as well as at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, staff were expecting to be working flat out. Instead, when the early shift arrived, they were sent home. The production lines have remained idle ever since. Though they are expected to resume operations in the coming days, it will be in a slow and carefully controlled manner. It could be another month before output returns to normal. Such was the impact of a major cyber attack that hit JLR at the end of August. It is working with various cyber security specialists and police to investigate, but the financial damage has already been done. Over a month's worth of worldwide production was lost. Analysts have estimated its losses at £50m per week. Getty Images JLR's production lines were left idle after the firm faced a cyber attack at the end of August For a company that made a £2.5bn profit in the last financial year, and which is owned by the Indian giant Tata Group, the losses should be painful but not fatal. But JLR is not an isolated incident. So far this year there has been a wave of cyber attacks targeting big businesses, including retailers such as Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, as well as a key airport systems provider. Other high profile victims have included the children's nursery chain Kido, while last year incidents involving Southern Water and a company that provided essential blood tests to the NHS raised serious concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and services. In all, a government run survey on cyber security breaches estimates 612,000 businesses and 61,000 charities were targeted across the UK. So just how much are attacks like these costing businesses and the economy? And could it be, as one expert analyst puts it, that this year's major attacks are the result of a ""cumulative effect of a kind of inaction"" on cyber security from the government and businesses that is now starting to bite? Pyramid of suppliers affected What is significant about an attack on the scale of the one that hit JLR is just how far the consequences can stretch. The company sits at the top of a pyramid of suppliers, thousands of them. They range from major multinationals, such as Bosch, down to small firms with a handful of employees, and they include companies which are heavily reliant on a single customer: JLR. For many of those firms, the shutdown represented a very real threat to their business. In a letter to the Chancellor on 25 September, the Business and Trade Committee warned that smaller firms ""may have at best a week of cashflow left to support themselves"", while larger companies ""may begin to seriously struggle within a fortnight"". Industry analysts expressed concerns that if companies started to go bankrupt, a trickle could soon become a flood – potentially causing permanent damage to the country's advanced engineering industry. Resuming production does not automatically mean the crisis is over either. ""It has come too late,"" explains David Roberts, who is the Chairman of Coventry-based Evtec, a direct supplier to JLR, with some 1,250 employees. ""All of our companies have had six weeks of zero sales, but all the costs. The sector still desperately needs cash."" From Co-op to Marks & Spencer A recent IBM report, which looked at data breaches experienced by about 600 organisations worldwide found that the average cost was $4.4m (or £3.3m). But JLR is far from an outlier when it comes to high-profile cyber attacks on an even greater scale. Marks & Spencer and the Co-op supermarket chain this year are estimated to have cost £300 million and £120 million respectively. Over the Easter weekend in April, attackers managed to gain entry to Marks & Spencer's IT systems via a third-party contractor, forcing it to take some networks offline. Initially, the disruption seemed relatively minor – with contactless payment systems out of action, and customers unable to use its 'click and collect' service. However, within days, it had halted all online shopping – which normally makes up around a third of its business. It was described at the time as ""almost like cutting off one of your limbs"", by Nayna McIntosh, former executive committee member of M&S and the founder of Hope Fashion. Bloomberg via Getty Images Attackers managed to gain entry to Marks & Spencer's IT systems via a third-party contractor When the Co-op supermarket chain was hit, the same group of hackers claimed responsibility. It was, they suggested, an attempt to extort a ransom from the company by infecting its networks with malicious software. However the IT networks were shut down quickly enough to avoid significant damage. As the criminals angrily described it to the BBC, ""they yanked their own plug - tanking sales, burning logistics, and torching shareholder value"". According to Jamie MacColl, a cyber expert at the security research group, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), it is no surprise to see major businesses being targeted in this way. He says it is the result of hackers being easily able to get hold of so-called ransomware (software which can lock up or encrypt a victim's computer networks until a ransom is paid). ""Historically, this kind of cyber crime… has mostly been carried out by Russian-speaking criminals, based in Russia or other parts of the former Soviet Union"", he explains. ""But there's been a bit of a change in the last couple of years where English-speaking, mostly teenage hackers have been leasing or renting ransomware from those Russian-speaking cyber criminals, and then using it to disrupt and extort from the businesses they've gained access to. ""And those English-speaking criminals do tend to focus on quite high-profile victims, because they're not just financially motivated: they want to demonstrate their skill and get kudos within this quite nasty sort of hacking ecosystem that we have."" Weak spots of big business What makes companies like Jaguar Land Rover and Marks & Spencer particularly vulnerable is the way in which their supply chains work. Carmakers have a long tradition of using so-called ""just-in-time delivery"", where parts are not held in stock but delivered from suppliers exactly where and when they are needed. This cuts down on storage and waste costs. But it also requires intricate coordination of every aspect of the supply chain, and if the computers break down, the disruption can be dramatic. Likewise, a retailer like Marks & Spencer relies on a carefully coordinated supply chain to guarantee customers the right quantities of fresh produce in the right places - which similarly proves vulnerable. Reuters If computers break down, the disruption can be dramatic for those businesses that require intricate coordination of every aspect of the supply chain ""Other industries have this model too: electronics and high-tech, because it's expensive and risky to hold inventory for a long time due to obsolescence. And then other industrial firms, such as in aerospace, for similar reasons to automotive,"" explains Elizabeth Rust, lead economist at Oxford Economics. ""So they're a bit more vulnerable to supply chain disruption from a cyber attack."" But she points out this is not the case for industries such as pharmaceuticals, where regulators require firms to hold minimum levels of stock. Rethinking lean production Andy Palmer, a former chief executive of Aston Martin who has spent decades working in the manufacturing sector, thinks the lean production models in the car and food industries need a rethink. It is a major risk, he says, when you have ""these systems where everything is tied to everything else, where the waste is taken out of every stage… but you break one link in that chain and you have no safety. ""The manufacturing sector has to have another look at the way it tackles this latest black swan"", he says, referring to an event that is unforeseen but which has significant consequences. But according to Ms Rust, businesses are unlikely to change the way their supply chains operate. ""Cyber attacks are really expensive… but shifting away from just-in-time management is potentially even more expensive. This is hundreds of millions, possibly, that a firm would have to incur annually"". She believes the costs would also make it a steep challenge for regulators to demand such changes. 'The cumulative effect of inaction' In late September a ransomware attack on American aviation technology firm Collins Aerospace caused serious problems at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow, after it disabled check-in and baggage handling systems. The problem was resolved relatively quickly, but not before a large number of flights had been cancelled. Industry sources warn that Europe's airspace and key airports are so heavily congested that disruption in one area can quickly spread to others – and the costs can quickly add up. In this instance, the knock-on effects were largely confined to widespread delays and flight cancellations. But it nods to a bigger question of what happens if a hack on critical infrastructure paralyses financial, transport or energy networks, potentially leading to huge economic costs - or worse? AFP via Getty Images A ransomware attack caused serious problems at a number of European airports, including London Heathrow last year ""I think the worst-case scenario is probably something affecting financial services or energy provision, because of the potential cascading effects of either of those two"", says RUSI analyst Jamie MacColl. ""The good news is the financial sector is by far the most heavily-regulated sector in the UK for cyber security. And I think it's quite telling, there's rarely been a very impactful cyber attack on a Western bank."" The outlook, were there an attack on the energy sector, is not clear. A 2015 study by Lloyds Bank, entitled ""Business Blackout"", modelled the impact of a hypothetical attack on the US power grid, concluding that economic losses could exceed $1 trillion (£742bn). However Mr MacColl believes that in the UK, there is probably enough spare capacity in the grid to deal with a cyber incident. More concerningly, Mr MacColl thinks the UK has had ""quite a laissez-faire approach to cyber security over the past 15 years"", with the issue given little priority by successive governments. He believes that this year's major attacks may be the ""cumulative effect of a kind of inaction on cyber security, both from the government and from businesses, and it's sort of really starting to bite now"". That inaction, he says, needs to change, with both regulators and large businesses taking more responsibility. Anadolu via Getty Images Some check-in and baggage handling systems were disabled as a result of the attack that affected several European airports In July last year the government did announce plans to introduce a Cyber Security and Resilience bill but its passage to becoming law has been repeatedly delayed. In May, GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre published a report warning about the growing impact of cyber threats from hackers using artificial intelligence-based tools. It suggested that over the next two years, ""a growing divide will emerge between organisations that can keep pace with AI-enabled threats, and those that fall behind – exposing them to greater risk, and intensifying the overall threat to the UK's digital infrastructure. However, what worries Jamie MacColl most are the sorts of attacks we haven't yet thought to protect against. ""I would be more concerned about the sort of company that is the only business that provides a particular service, but that we don't really know about, and that isn't regulated as critical national infrastructure"", he says. An attack on one of these less glamourous economic pivots, he argues, could have huge ramifications through the wider economy. ""That's the sort of thing that would keep me up at night,"" he says. ""The single point of failure that we are not aware of yet.""

38715f0750d0,How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance,,"How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance Osmond Chia Business reporter Getty Images Jensen Huang, the boss of Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, has warned China is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US in chips The US has dominated the global technology market for decades. But China wants to change that. The world's second largest economy is pouring huge amounts of money into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Crucially, Beijing is also investing heavily to  produce the high-end chips that power these cutting-edge technologies. Last month, Jensen Huang - the boss of Silicon Valley-based AI chip giant Nvidia - warned that China was just ""nanoseconds behind"" the US in chip development. So can Beijing match American technology and break its reliance on imported high-end chips? After DeepSeek China's DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech world in 2024 when it launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT . The announcement by a relatively unknown startup was impressive for a number of reasons, not least because the company said it cost much less to train than leading AI models. It was said to have been created using far fewer high-end chips than its rivals , and its launch temporarily sank Silicon Valley-based Nvidia's market value. And momentum in China's tech sector has continued. This year, some of the country's big tech firms have made it clear that they aim to take on Nvidia and become the main advanced chip suppliers for local companies. In September, Chinese state media said a new chip announced by Alibaba can match the performance of Nvidia's H20 semiconductors while using less energy. H20s are scaled-down processors made for the Chinese market under US export rules. Huawei also unveiled what it said were its most powerful chips ever, along with a three-year plan to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market. The Chinese tech giant also said it would make its designs and computer programs available to the public in China in an effort to draw firms away from their reliance on US products. Getty Images DeepSeek stunned the tech world in 2024 when it launched an AI model to rival ChatGPT Other Chinese chip developers have also secured major contracts with big businesses in the country. MetaX is supplying advanced chips for the likes of state-owned telecoms operator, China Unicom. Another hotly-tipped potential challenger to Nvidia is Beijing-based Cambricon Technologies. Its Shanghai-listed shares have more than doubled in value over the last three months as investors bet that it will benefit from Beijing's push for Chinese firms to use locally produced high-end chips. Tencent, which owns the super app WeChat, is another notable tech giant that has heeded the government’s call to use Chinese chips. There has also been no shortage of state-backed trade shows, promoting Chinese technology companies in a bid to attract investors. ""The competition has undeniably arrived,"" a spokesperson for Nvidia told the BBC in response to queries about the recent progress made by Chinese chip firms. ""Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We'll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere."" Yet some experts have cautioned that claims made by Chinese chipmakers should be taken with a pinch of salt due to a lack of publicly available data and consistent testing benchmarks. China's semiconductors perform similarly to the US in predictive AI but fall short in complex analytics, said computer scientist Jawad Haj-Yahya, who has tested both American and Chinese chips. ""The gap is clear and it is surely shrinking. But I don't think it's something they will catch up on in the short-term."" Where China leads - and lags On the BG2 technology and business podcast in September, Nvidia's Jensen Huang highlighted the strengths of China's tech sector, crediting its hardworking and vast talent pool, intense domestic competition and progress in chipmaking. ""This is a vibrant entrepreneurial, high-tech, modern industry,"" he said, urging the US to compete ""for its survival"". His assessment is likely to be welcomed by officials in Beijing. The country has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West. For years, China has invested heavily in what President Xi Jinping calls ""high-quality development"", which covers industries from renewables to AI. Even before US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, China had spent tens of billions of dollars as part of its efforts to transform its vast economy from the ""world's factory"" for basic products to a home of cutting-edge industries. An ongoing tariffs war with Trump's America has only made that mission more urgent. Xi has vowed to make his country more self-reliant and not depend on ""anyone's gifts"". Mr Huang has also warned that the US should trade freely with China or risk handing it the edge in the AI race. This comes against a backdrop of Beijing applying more pressure on Nvidia as it launched an anti-monopoly probe into the firm last month. But China's state-led approach can also be an obstacle to innovation if everyone in the sector only focuses on a ""shared goal"", said computing professor Chia-Lin Yang from the National Taiwan University. It can make it harder for disruptive ideas to break the mould, she added. China's chip industry has also yet to overcome criticism that its products can be less user-friendly than those of Western rivals like Nvidia. Prof Yang believes these issues can soon be solved by China's huge number of skilled tech industry workers. ""You cannot underestimate China's ability to catch up."" Getty Images Chinese tech giant Huawei unveiled its plans to rival Nvidia's dominance in AI chips 'Bargaining chip' for China She described China's recent announcements about the chip sector as a ""bargaining chip"" in its months-long tariffs negotiations with the US. Beijing aims to pressure Washington into selling its advanced equipment or risk losing its position in such a large market, said Dr Jawad. These announcements project strength on China's part, even though it is likely to still want to buy American technology, he added. Most experts agree that China is still reliant on the US for the most powerful chips, at least for now. Beijing needs access to some high-end American technology for its more advanced projects and to ensure it isn't left behind, said semiconductor engineer Raghavendra Anjanappa. Realistically, China can reduce its dependence on American chips in less-advanced tools, but doesn't have the ""raw performance"" of US chips to train more complex AI systems, said Mr Raghavendra. Despite a number of breakthroughs China still lacks the highly developed supply chains that have been long established in the US, South Korea and Taiwan. The US has also deployed export restrictions as it tries to slow down China's development of advanced technology, including Washington's decision to block Beijing's access to high-end Nvidia chips . The US has ""hit China exactly where its dependency is deepest,"" said Mr Raghavendra. ""But China's not far off in the grand scheme and they might only need five more years to be independent from the US.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9949/live/85746ea0-9cd6-11f0-8245-f3f629744491.jpg,2025-10-05T23:00:21.882000+00:00,1f133e37999005a65c04b512a274d6d8c2bfbef8
afdb256e21a3,How to get AI to work in 22 languages,,"How to get AI to work in 22 languages Priti Gupta Technology Reporter, Mumbai Priti Gupta Translation tech has made work easier for Vineet Sawant Vineet Sawant has spent the last two years navigating the streets of Mumbai on a scooter as a delivery driver. ""Being on the road is always very stressful and especially in cities like Mumbai,"" he says. But when he started out language barriers were an additional problem. His first language is Marathi and Mr Sawant speaks ""very little"" English. ""I can understand but it's very difficult to read,"" he explains. That caused problems at his new job. He said: ""At first, it was difficult. Everything was in English, and I can understand some of it, but I'm more comfortable in Marathi. I used to ask other delivery guys to help me figure out what to do."" His employer, Zepto, promises ""India's Fastest Online Grocery Delivery"". So having drivers struggling with delivery instructions was not ideal. To smooth this process a year ago, Zepto partnered with Reverie Language Technologies to introduce an AI translation service for its drivers. Since then its delivery drivers have been able to choose between six languages on the Zepto app. ""I don't have to guess anymore,"" says Mr Sawant. ""Earlier I would take more time to read and sometimes even made mistakes. Now if the customer writes 'ring bell', I get that instruction in Marathi. So, I don't have to ask or check again. It's all clear."" Getty Images India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects Mr Sawant's difficulties are common. ""India has 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects,"" says Professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya, from IIT Mumbai, one of India's leading experts in the use of AI in Indian languages. ""Without tech, that understands and speaks these languages, millions are excluded from the digital revolution - especially in education, governance, healthcare, and banking,"" he points out. The rollout of new generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, has made the task more urgent. Vast amounts of data, like web pages, books or video transcripts are used to train an AI. In widely spoken languages like Hindi and English that is relatively easy to get, but for others it is more difficult. ""The main challenge to create Indian language models is the availability of data. I'm talking about refined data. Coarse quality data, is available. But that data is not of very high quality, it needs filtering,"" says Professor Bhattacharyya. ""The issue in India is for many Indian languages, especially tribal and regional dialects, this data simply doesn't exist or is not digitised."" Reverie Language Technologies is now deploying its AI-driven translation technology for a range of Indian companies. Co-founder Vivekananda Pani says that while translation technology will make communication easier, there is ""potential for less common dialects to be pushed aside"". ""The challenge will be to make sure that the amazing benefits of AI-driven language advancements don't accidentally shrink the rich variety of human language."" To help tackle the problem Professor Bhattacharyya has contributed to Bhashini , a government project to develop those high quality datasets needed to train an AI. As well as the datasets, Bhashini has built AI language models and translation services in 22 languages. Started in 2022, it's a huge undertaking, but has already made a lot of progress. Bhashini currently hosts 350 AI-based language models that have processed more than a billion tasks. More than 50 government departments work with Bhashini, as well as 25 state governments. For example Bhashini tech is used in multi-lingual chatbots for public services and to translate government schemes into local languages. ""Bhashini ensures India's linguistic and cultural representation by building India-specific AI models rather than relying on global platforms,"" says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Digital India, Bhashini Division. He hopes that within the next two or three years rural users will have voice-enabled access to government services, financial tools and information systems in their native languages. Getty Images Indian researches are developing an AI to help smokers quit These India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population. Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging. Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking. He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. The AI ""will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,"" says Professor Jadhav. And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi. ""It will be very customized, it will not be something just off the shelf,"" he says. Back on the streets of the city, Vineet Sawant has increased the number of parcels he delivers from ten to around 30 a day, helped in part by the translation function in the delivery app. He thinks it will help more people like him. ""It makes us feel like we belong. Not everyone understands English. When the app speaks our language, we feel more confident, and we work better.""

8bef639bf36c,Could aluminium become the packaging 'champion'?,,"Could aluminium become the packaging 'champion'? MaryLou Costa Technology Reporter Meadow Some packaging firms are betting on aluminium In front of me is a line-up of aluminium cans, but not a drink in sight. Instead, these cans have been designed to hold toiletries like shampoo, shower gel and hand wash, condiments like ketchup and household cleaning products. I'm at the London research and development centre for Meadow, a start-up that has developed a new packaging system. Their idea is to move products currently packaged in plastic to aluminium cans. The founders believe it could be the next big step in reducing the amount of plastic packaging in the world, thanks to the high recycling rate of aluminium cans compared to plastic - 81% vs 52%, according to figures from the National Packaging Waste Database. Meadow has taken the typical aluminium drink can and tweaked it, so that it will slot into a cannister, which can be equipped with all sorts of dispensing options. So depending on the contents, you could have a pump, a squeeze top, spray nozzle, screw top lid or other options. The can itself has a sealed top and crinkles at the edges to make it clear the contents aren't to be drunk. When the can is empty, it can be taken out for recycling, and replaced with a new one. Aluminium can manufacturer Ball, which already offers recyclable aluminium packaging for shampoos and lotions, has invested in Meadow and will offer the system to the big personal care brands it works with. ""We realised the greenest container already exists - the aluminium can. So we thought, what do we need to do, to take it to new industries?"" says Victor Ljungberg, Meadow's co-founder and chief executive, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden. Meadow Meadow hopes its dispenser will attract new product lines to aluminium packaging Aluminium has strong recyclability credentials; it is considered to be infinitely recyclable, compared with plastic, which loses its quality after being recycled several times. It is also lighter than glass, so the energy needed to transport aluminium cans is significantly less than glass bottles. The wine industry has already trialled full size aluminium bottles, with organic brand Vinca rolling them out in March through Tesco. Aldi this year also launched an own-label wine in an aluminium bottle. More industries are set to make the jump, as new EU packaging and waste regulations come into effect in January 2030, stating that all packaging should be at least 70% recyclable. By 2038, the minimum level of recyclability for packaging will jump to 80%. Getty Images Producing aluminium is energy intensive So what might hold back aluminium? Producing new aluminium is energy intensive. It requires almost twice as much energy to produce as glass. Calculating the environmental impact of aluminium versus glass is complicated and often the best choice depends on what is being shipped. Price is definitely a factor, according to Mark Lansley, the owner and chief executive of Broadland Drinks, which supplied the aluminium-bottled wine to Aldi, and has another similar launch planned this year. Aluminium, explains Mr Lansley, is a third lighter than glass, saving about 900 grams of CO2 emissions - but is four times more expensive. He admits to absorbing the extra cost alongside Aldi in the name of innovation, but says that aluminium becoming more widely adopted relies on its cost coming down. ""We've got to get over this cost. We've got to sell the benefits and better spell out the lower carbon footprint that aluminium has,"" says Mr Lansley. Consumers will also need to adapt to different looking packaging. Mr Lansley says the wine industry already tackled this challenge when it introduced screw tops, but when it comes to packaging, there are just some situations where only a glass wine bottle will do. ""Aluminium bottles are lighter and don't shatter, so they are much better for a picnic, or by the pool. But then you've got tradition, and what folks are used to. ""You might be opening a bottle of wine to celebrate with friends, or as a reward and relaxation. A glass bottle of wine is embedded in that culture,"" says Mr Lansley. Vinca Some winemakers are experimenting with aluminium bottles A lot of what consumers associate with their favourite brands has been intentionally driven by those brands, and changing that could take a lot of convincing too, notes Jamie Stone, packaging expert at global innovation consultancy PA Consulting. ""Big brands have spent decades and invested billions in educating customers on distinctive packaging - think of the iconic Heinz ketchup bottle, a bottle of Flash spray, or Kikkoman soy sauce,"" Mr Stone, who is London-based, points out. ""Aluminium can't easily make shaped packs. That's a challenge when shape forms a key part of brand identity and consumer recognition. Think how many everyday products - like sauces, shampoo, washing up liquid, or moisturisers - rely on squeezable packaging. Aluminium, being rigid, removes that functionality."" He adds: ""In many categories, consumers want to see the product they're buying, whether it's the colour of a juice, the consistency of a lotion, or the thickness of a sauce. Aluminium's opacity removes that visual connection."" Mark Armstrong is a design director at creative agency Marks, which has designed packaging for Starbucks. He says one reason we haven't seen aluminium packaging become the norm, is that manufacturers have long-established plastic packaging lines. These would require significant modification or replacement to handle aluminium, at a high cost. And, most food-grade aluminium needs internal lacquer or polymer coatings, which must also meet recyclability guidelines, Mr Armstrong adds. ""Aluminium is arguably the champion of recyclable materials. But the options for dispensing and reseal-ability often rely on a secondary plastic material. This then compromises the recyclability for consumers if it requires them to separate out materials to be recycled, which greatly weakens the appeal,"" says Mr Armstrong. Innovations in plastic's sustainability also can't be ignored, from the development of ones that can be infinitely recycled, to those that are biodegradable. For that reason, Jayne Paramor, sustainable packaging lead at sustainability consultancy Anthesis, argues that plastic may still end up as brands' packaging of choice. ""Plastics remain highly suited to many packaging applications due to their durability, inertness and design flexibility,"" says Ms Paramor.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3nw5vnzgpo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/56fa/live/a9bf34c0-55b4-11f0-adae-51d36c615fe4.jpg,2025-07-28T23:04:41.067000+00:00,435fb67c9815d9ef50dfce6d5266faea50e9d1b4
e0314154097e,"Artificial food colours are out, so what's next?",,"Artificial food colours are out, so what's next? Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Fermentalg There are hundreds of thousands of microalgae species French firm Fermentalg has been all over the planet in its search for useful microalgae. ""One of our lucky scientists got to go and climb the volcanoes in the Caribbean for example, and I have to restrain myself from collecting more every time I go home to New Zealand,"" says Hywel Griffiths, chief scientific officer at Fermentalg. There are hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae - microscopic organisms, which mostly live in water. They are essential to the aquatic food chain and also produce half the oxygen we breathe. Some are already used commercially, to make food, animal feed and fertiliser . But for Fermantalg one particular type, Galdieria sulphuraria, has a very useful trait. It can be used to produce a pigment, suitable for use in food, called Galdieria blue. ""We grow the algae and make a lot of it under conditions which make a lot of this particular molecule - the blue,"" says Mr Griffiths. The pigment can be used for any food and drinks and Mr Griffiths expects the first products using Galdieiria blue will be on shop shelves early next year. Galdieria blue was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May, along with Butterfly pea flower extract (also a blue colour) and calcium phosphate (white). The FDA also approved Gardenia blue earlier this month. Fermentalg Fermentalg grows a microalgae that produces a blue molecule New sources of colour for food are needed as artificial food dyes are on their way out. In January, the FDA announced the banning of Red Dye No. 3 in food products. In addition, the FDA is looking to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes such as Yellow Dye 5 and 6 by the end of next year as part of the government's mission to ""Make America Healthy Again"". ""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,"" FDA commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference in April. Though not an outright ban, the FDA is hoping the food industry voluntarily complies to eliminate artificial food dyes by 2026. It comes after years of pressure from parents and campaigners for the FDA to revoke approval for dyes or educate consumers more about the risks. In recent times, many US states have made their own moves to pass laws to remove artificial food colouring dyes. Countries differ on the restrictions they have in place. Historically, the UK and the European Union have been stricter than the US. The EU has been phasing out artificial colourings over the last 20 years and also introducing warnings on foods with other colours. Sensient Sensient processes natural products and extracts the colours So, these are good times for firms developing natural alternatives. US-based Sensient creates natural colours by sourcing raw materials that are grown specifically for their colour content. For example, some red and purple colours are derived from carrots and potatoes. ""These crops are harvested, washed, processed into a juice, and the colour is extracted with water or other solvents,"" says Paul Manning, chief executive officer at Sensient. ""The resulting colour is further processed to stabilise the concentrate and refine it to the specific shade desired by the customer."" But the hard work will be trying to match the synthetic colour. ""It must be equally vivid,"" says Mr Manning. ""There are plenty of examples of brands converting to natural colours with less vivid and vibrant shades where the product does poorly in the market and customers complain about both the colour and the flavour."" Getting a stable, bright colour also involved much work for Fermantalg. ""To our surprise we found that the process of growing the algae and the process of extracting the colour can actually have a fairly significant impact on the stability of the product at the end, even though it's fairly heavily purified,"" says Griffiths. ""But something that we've done upstream is having an impact on how stable it is at the end."" Will these new colours cost more? ""They are more expensive, but in actual contribution to the end product, they're not actually that big an impact because these things are used at a fraction of a percentage in the final product,"" says Mr Griffiths. ""If you had a nosebleed and stood over the sink… you know that a little bit of colour goes a long way."" Sensient There's a rush to produce alternative food colours For the brands that have long relied on artificial colourings, it's an upheaval. ""We are reformulating our cereals served in schools to not include FD&C colours by the 2026-27 school year,"" says a spokesperson for WK Kellogg, the company behind Kellogg's. FD&C refers to certain certified synthetic colour additives regulated by the FDA, and approved by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Last year protesters gathered outside the company headquarters in Michigan,  calling on it to remove artificial dyes from cereals such as Froot Loops. ""We will not be launching any new products with FD&C colours, beginning in January 2026,"" the spokesperson said. This year food giants including Nestle, Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Conagra have all pledged to phase out artificial food colourings . One of the challenges for food brands reliant on artificial colouring is that many natural food dyes don't necessarily have a long shelf life, says Institute of Food Technologists food scientist Renee Leber. ""Whereas synthetic dyes will outlive the shelf life of pretty much any product."" She also says that as many brands rush to make the switch it's going to lead to a ""bottleneck"" in production. ""We don't necessarily have all these colours available. But we have 10 months to get that right."" Given this isn't an outright ban, is it still expected to lead to sweeping change in the US food industry? ""If you are a cereal company and you have a brightly coloured cereal and all of your competitors switch from synthetics to natural colours, then you don't necessarily want to be the last one,"" says Ms Leber. ""It's a tight timeframe but companies are doing their best to comply.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g83dpeendo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0155/live/0f9c05d0-6932-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg,2025-07-24T23:01:09.989000+00:00,8c4ba16477e3cc1f5673ffa276b1ac032749cdf0
42ce42dea81c,Trucking's uneasy relationship with new tech,,"Trucking's uneasy relationship with new tech Sam Gruet Technology Reporter, Vancouver Getty Images Digital trucking apps look to minimise trucks without cargo When Jared first started out in trucking more than two decades ago, he didn't anticipate he'd be on tour with a country music star, hauling guitars, amps, and other pieces of on-stage equipment. ""It just happened, right place, right time,"" the Canadian driver, who prefers not to use his surname, explains from behind the wheel of his towering lorry. ""I've done 5,000 miles in a month and a half, but there's a lot of breaks this year."" But during time off between driving to shows in New Jersey, New York, Toronto and Nashville, Jared will be scanning multiple screens in his cabin – a laptop, tablet and two smart phones – to secure more work. All made possible by new technology. It's a world away from his early career, when he was transporting fruit and wine, he explains. ""Back in the day, you had to sit by a payphone if you're on the road and start calling people you've worked with and then you'd have a pager. ""Today, you just turn on your devices and scan through possible work. It's all digital and you get paid instantly. It's much better for business."" The change has been driven by ""Uberised"" platforms, digitally matching truckers with companies which need to move freight. The phrase was coined due to the similarity to the ride hailing app. While Jared agrees it has made things easier, the truck driver says it has led to wages falling. ""During Covid, the average was $3 (£2.24) per mile, today on some loads from Toronto to Los Angeles that is $1.10 per mile."" Not to mention, he says, the rising cost of fuel. In Canada, eight major platforms including Uber Freight, have emerged to digitise the market for freight. Like the taxi app, they are capitalising on a fragmented market dominated by smaller players, with 2023 data suggesting that more than eight in 10 trucking and freight firms in Canada employ fewer than five people. Christopher Monette, from Teamsters Canada, told the BBC that the Canadian Trade Union representing over 130,000 members including truckers, has ""deep concerns around the efforts to 'Uberise' the trucking sector"". ""Wages in Canada have remained largely stagnant for the past 25 years, and the rise of gig-style work stands to make things even worse,"" he argues, adding that ""larger, often unionised carriers who operate responsibly by investing in safety, training, and decent working conditions are most at risk"". ""Truckers don't need another app. We need stronger protections and bigger paycheques."" When asked, Uber Freight did not directly address the issue of wages and prices. Instead, a spokesperson said: ""Flexibility, transparency, and choice are built directly into our platform. ""Carriers can search for loads based on their preferences, such as lane, equipment type, commodity, and schedule, and either book instantly at a listed price or submit a bid for a rate that better aligns with their needs. In the trucking industry a lane refers to a regularly travelled route. ""Our platform also uses real-time market data and AI-powered recommendations to help carriers make the most of their time on the road,"" the spokesperson said. Eric Beckwitt's firm is using AI to speed up complicated bookings Vancouver-based Freightera is among the biggest players when it comes to digital trucking services in Canada. Co-founder Eric Beckwitt meets me at a point overlooking the city's sprawling port, where towering orange cranes move brightly coloured containers against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains. When he started the company in 2014, there were no trucking apps for Canadian companies. The service he has developed allows drivers and customers to search 20 billion regular routes for hauling freight which, he says, can be done in ""five or 10 seconds"". He points out that, unlike other platforms, Freightera does not set prices. ""At Freightera, carriers set their own price. We ask them what they need to be healthy and profitable on each lane, and they set the price."" Mr Beckwitt says the service has been good for trucking. Before services like his came along, finding work, or even the best route, was like ""finding a needle in a haystack"", the Freightera boss explains. ""Carriers really appreciate Freightera's reliable demand for service, which has grown every year consistently, right through Covid, the inflation afterwards and the current freight recession, one of the largest running freight downtowns,"" he says. The company is now developing AI to speed up complicated bookings: ""Digging through the noisy, messy documents, fine print and inconsistent rules - things like missing paperwork, unexpected charges, or a routing issue that could throw off delivery."" Mr Beckwitt also dreams of a completely automated freight industry, ""40 years from now"", where AI would control global freight. ""Automatically assigning cargo to networks with the lowest capacity and allowing complete transparency, tracking and even trading while they're in travel"". Getty Images Around three quarters of Kenyan freight is moved by trucks Digital trucking services are employed all over the world. Kenya heavily relies on road freight, so has embraced the new tech. ""Over 75% of inland freight is moved by road and in many cases it's the only mode of transportation available,"" says Jean-Claude Homawoo, co-founder of Africa's biggest digitised freight platform, LORI. Since launching in 2016, LORI has grown its network to 20,000 trucks. It doesn't own any vehicles but manages them digitally, trying to ensure that trucks don't stand idle or return home empty. In that time, he says, ""there are certain routes like Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda, where we have loaded so many trucks that the price of a full truckload has fallen"". If truckers are finding work that requires less driving around without cargo, then they should be using less fuel. And that could be helpful in cutting the industry's contribution to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Trucking accounts for more than half of CO2 emissions within trade-related transport, according to a 2022 McKinsey report . Mr Beckwitt is convinced that tech like his, is the answer. ""It's just so much more energy-efficient and so much more cost-efficient,"" he adds. Getty Images Driverless trucks are being trialled across China One form of AI might be helping drivers find work, but another could, one day, put them out of work. In April, a commercial driverless truck took to an American highway for the first time ever, operated by US-based tech firm Aurora. In China, fleets of driverless lorries are currently operating on test routes around the country. ""The technology is there,"" explains Freightera's Mr Beckwitt. ""It's just whether we trust it to be let loose on the roads. And there's obviously bureaucratic hurdles in the way and red tape."" For trucker Jared though, self-driving freight is still a distant prospect. ""Transportation has been around for hundreds of years. It's not going to end with people worrying about self-driving trucks, that's not going to happen any time soon.""

33ce7ee44bc4,The indigenous weavers who aim for empowerment over exploitation,,"The indigenous weavers who aim for empowerment over exploitation Catherine Ellis Business reporter, Riohacha, Colombia BBC In the Colombian city of Riohacha there are numerous street sellers of traditional bags called mochilas For every handwoven bag she sells on the palm-lined promenade of Riohacha, a city on Colombia's Caribbean coast, Sandra Aguilar feels that she's sharing a piece of her heritage. Once used exclusively by the Wayuu, the largest indigenous group in the South American country, the bags - known as mochilas - are now a staple across Colombia, and popular with foreign tourists. But these days the bags are also increasingly sold in global boutiques, featured at fashion events around the world, and listed on platforms like Etsy, Amazon, and Instagram - reaching buyers who may never have set foot in Colombia. ""Thanks to online posts, international visitors are becoming very knowledgeable about the mochila,"" Ms Aguilar says. ""They recognise and appreciate its ancestral value."" Weaving has long been central to the Wayuu people, who number around 380,000 in Colombia. They have lived for centuries on the semi-arid peninsula of La Guajira in the northeast of the country, and extend into neighbouring Venezuela. Techniques are passed down through generations, with geometric patterns on many mochilas reflecting clan identity, spirituality, and the natural world. Weaving is also a vital source of income in La Guajira, Colombia's second-poorest province, where two-thirds of the population live in poverty. For Ms Aguilar, both domestic mochila sales and exports have improved conditions in her rural Wayuu community of 11 families, and enabled her daughter and niece to attend university. But while the growing global demand has improved opportunities for some, it has also brought challenges. Many artisans face exploitation, and there are concerns that traditional craftsmanship is being sacrificed for speed and commercial gain. Some Wayuu women - supported by socially-conscious entrepreneurs - are working to access fairer export markets and promote the mochila's cultural value. Prices for Wayuu mochilas vary considerably. A medium-sized lower quality bag - made with simpler designs and weaving techniques - can be found across Colombia for around $20 (£15) - sometimes less. Higher-end bags typically start at around $80 and can rise to several hundred pounds, depending on the weaving time, complexity of the design. Traditionally, mochilas were crafted over weeks, but rising demand led many weavers to develop faster techniques, producing simpler designs in two or three days. Sandra Aguilar sells mochilas made by women in her extended Wayuu family For Colombian entrepreneur Laura Chica, compliments on the Wayuu bag she was using during a trip to Europe sparked a business idea. She founded mochila company Chila Bags back in 2013. ""Instagram was just starting, and the brand began to take off,"" she says. Ms Chica says she focuses on high-quality bags incorporating traditional patterns and elements. The bags reflect the artisans' skills, time, and heritage, for which they receive a fair wage, she says. Her brand has been featured in magazines, such as Vogue China, and showcased at international fashion weeks and high-end retail spaces from Hawaii to London, Paris and Shanghai. But does she think the flourishing popularity of mochilas has been beneficial for the Wayuu? For Ms Chica, that very much depends on which market you look at. She says two have developed. ""There are brands, and those interested in the story behind how the bag is made, that want to keep sharing it with the world,"" she says. She adds that these provide a market for customers who value indigenous arts, sustainability and fair trade, and are willing to pay more. But not all weavers have been able to access ways to work with such companies that pay decent prices, says Ms Chica. Instead she says that that many have to rely on a parallel market where quick production, sales and profits are prioritised, which undermines pay and the quality of the work. In Riohacha's Mercado Nuevo - a maze-like market bursting with colourful stalls selling yarn, chinchorros (traditional Wayuu hammocks) and mochilas - a group of women crouches on the concrete floor, weaving. They explain that intermediaries, or middlemen, may offer them as little as $5.50 per bag, but after paying for thread and transport, they often earn as little as $1.50 - excluding the time spent weaving. Many such Wayuu weavers come from rural, isolated communities where only Wayuunaiki - the Wayuu language - is spoken. This makes it difficult for them to access a broader customer base and navigate economic opportunities. As a result, they sell to the middlemen. ""Some Wayuu women are being forced to accept whatever price, benefiting everyone except the women themselves,"" says Paula Restrepo, director of Fundación Talento Colectivo. Her organisation supports female weavers, whom she and many others recognise as skilled artisans, through education and training. She is keen to stress that not all intermediaries are harmful. Instead, she says that the reputable ones, which she calls ""solidarity intermediaries"" help establish an equitable system for purchasing mochilas, ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions through fair trade principles. Her foundation has partnered with mochila brand and non-profit organisation One Thread Collective to provide the weavers with leadership workshops. ""The idea is that the artisans prepare themselves to be autonomous, to be entrepreneurs, to be capable in the future of being in contact with other clients,"" says Ms Restrepo. The weavers in Riohacha's Mercado Nuevo work on the concrete floor One of the weavers who has taken part in the workshops is Yamile Vangrieken.  Sitting on a bright orange chinchorro at her home on the outskirts of Riohacha, she explains she leads a group of eight relatives from the rural community where her family is from. She acts as a bridge between them - many of whom don't speak Spanish and haven't ever been to the city - and One Thread Collective, which helps them export their bags, while providing stable income, thread and microloans. Ms Vangrieken's weaving has helped support her teenage daughter, who herself began weaving at just four-years-old. Ms Vangrieken hopes she'll finish school, go to university, and keep weaving by choice - not out of financial necessity. While mochilas are gaining international recognition, that doesn't always translate into higher sales for every business. Brandon Miller is an American entrepreneur based in Riohacha. He runs Wayuumarket.com, a platform that helps Wayuu artisans sell directly to international buyers. He says his orders have slumped, not due to a lack of interest, but because more foreign businesses are travelling to La Guajira to source the bags directly, communicating through AI tools like ChatGPT and translation apps. Yamile Vangrieken earns enough money to support her daugther But buying online has changed too. Mr Miller says influencers - especially from China and Thailand - started streaming live from La Guajira on platforms like TikTok, offering real-time purchases to their followers. Shifts in demand, and how mochilas are sold, have raised concerns about control over the bags' design, narrative, and profits. Back on Riohacha's promenade, Ms Aguilar says the bag's fashion rise has led artisans to adapt or add elements, such as elaborate beading, religious icons, or even football club logos. She worries that these sales strategies are eroding cultural norms. But she remains positive. Recognition is increasing - not only of the Wayuu bags - but of the indigenous group and the weavers themselves. ""We are also artists, even if we don't have a title that says so,"" she says. ""Our essence is in our designs, in our products and we mustn't let that go. When we lose our customs and traditions, we are left with nothing.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62lnkvmn12o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/900a/live/f9622fd0-9300-11f0-a647-dff301f4a439.jpg,2025-10-05T23:19:10.051000+00:00,e43085227f7ef1e18bea89b52817438f1ebe123e

The consumer group is taking the tech giant to the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London on Monday. The trial between Which? and Qualcomm is expected to last five weeks. The consumer group is accusing the chip company of anti-competitive practices. It claims the firm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential handset components, which then pushed up the cost of those smartphones for consumers. The BBC has reached out to Qualcomm for comment. The trial starting on Monday will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused a dominant position. If Which? is successful, there will be a second stage seeking £480m from Qualcomm, to be distributed among an estimated 29 million British phone owners affected. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased between 1 October 2015 and 9 January 2024. The consumer group says this would probably work out at around £17 each. Qualcomm has previously said the case has ""no basis"". A similar case against Qualcomm is ongoing in Canada, and the firm has also previously been fined by the EU for antitrust. Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which?, said: ""This trial is a huge moment. It shows how the power of consumers - backed by Which? - can be used to hold the biggest companies to account if they abuse their dominant position.""

3e586b23f634,Housebuying reform plan aims to cut costs and time,,"Plans for a major reform of the housebuying system, which aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales, have been unveiled by the government. Housing Secretary Steve Reed said the changes would ""fix the broken system"" and put more money ""back into working people's pockets"". Under the new proposals, sellers and estate agents will be legally required to provide key information about a property up front. The overhaul could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and cut up to four weeks off the typical property transaction timeline, according to the government. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms. Those in the middle of a chain could also potentially gain a net saving of £400 as a result of the increased costs from selling being outweighed by lower buying expenses. The consultation draws on other jurisdictions, including the Scottish system where there is more upfront information and earlier binding contracts. This will include being up front about the condition of the home, any leasehold costs, and details of property chains. The government says this transparency will reduce the risk of deals collapsing late in the process and improve confidence among buyers, particularly those purchasing a home for the first time. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, a move intended to halve the number of failed transactions, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5bn a year. ""Buying a home should be a dream, not a nightmare,"" said Reed. ""Our reforms will fix the broken system so hardworking people can focus on the next chapter of their lives."" The reforms will also aim to boost professional standards across the housing sector. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed, along with the introduction of side-by-side performance data to help buyers choose trusted professionals based on expertise and track record. The government says a full roadmap for the changes will be published in the new year, forming part of its broader housing strategy, which includes a pledge to build 1.5 million new homes. Rightmove chief executive Johan Svanstrom said: ""We welcome the announcement today aiming to drive forward that much needed change and modernisation. ""The home-moving process involves many fragmented parts, and there's simply too much uncertainty and costs along the way. Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals."" Paul Whitehead chief executive at Zoopla said: ""We look forward to working closely with government and the wider industry to modernise the homebuying process, so that buyers are given certainty earlier and to help reduce any unnecessary costs."" The announcement comes as the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester. The party will lay out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account.

52ea2b20287d,JLR to restart some production after cyber shutdown,,"JLR to restart some production after cyber shutdown Theo Leggett Business correspondent and Michael Race Business reporter Getty Images JLR's Wolverhampton plant, pictured, will be the first to go back online following the attack Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week following a major cyber-attack that forced the carmaker to shut down factories and send workers home. Manufacturing will resume first at JLR's engine factory in Wolverhampton, but it is expected to be several weeks before all operations are running at full capacity, with other sites to return gradually. Work at JLR's three UK sites in the West Midlands and Merseyside has been suspended since a cyber-attack at the end of August forced the company to shut down. The resumption of operations will be a welcome relief to JLR's array of suppliers, some of which are small businesses that have faced huge financial pressure. JLR is continuing to investigate the attack, which forced the company to shut its IT systems and send workers home. That safety measure paralysed virtually every aspect of JLR's business and meant it could not build or sell any cars, or distribute parts to service centres. As well as its UK sites in Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton, the carmaker's factories in Slovakia, China and India have also been affected by the shutdown. The hack is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility. About 30,000 people are directly employed at the company's plants with about 200,000 working for firms in the supply chain. Some of these firms supply parts exclusively to JLR, while others sell components to other carmakers as well. Evtec Group is a so-called ""tier one"" supplier which provides parts directly to JLR, while sourcing the materials it needs from other companies lower down the supply chain. It has 1,250 employees mostly based in the West Midlands, but much like JLR's factories, its main plants in Coventry and Kidderminster have been at a virtual standstill for weeks. Machines have been shut down, parts set to be shipped out piled high and most staff sent home on 80% of their usual pay. Evtec Evtec's chairman David Roberts said the impact of the shutdown has been severe Workers will return in the coming days and weeks, but Evtec's chairman David Roberts told the BBC the stoppage has had a dramatic impact on communities in the West Midlands, and uncertainty remains. ""It has had a really detrimental effect, it's devastating. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there who are now really concerned – the cost of living, Christmas coming up, when will they return to work in earnest?"" Engineer Ben Brindley said the length of the disruption has fuelled fears about his job. ""There's only so much refurbishment or decorating you can do whilst you're at home,"" he said. ""The longer it goes on for, the more worried you get really. You start to think - will I have a job to come back to?"" Experts have warned while production will gradually resume, the impact of the cyber-attack on JLR is not over. The company said its recovery programme was ""firmly under way"" and that its global parts logistics centre, which supplies spare parts to dealerships for vehicle servicing, was ""returning to full operations"". But when it comes to restarting carmaking, experts point out the process is not like flicking a switch. Some industrial processes can take days to get back up and running, while JLR has already said the restart will be done in phases. Secondly, suppliers that have lost income during the shutdown may not be able to bounce back as quickly. 'Toothless support' Andy Palmer, who has held senior roles at Nissan and was the former boss of Aston Martin, said the restart process would ""take a while"", and added the supply chain was ""broken and needs to be repaired"". ""The other issue is the impact on suppliers. Some of them... might not make it, and if any of those fail then that's more disruption in the supply chain,"" he said. While the government has agreed to back loans for JLR to support suppliers, Evtec's Mr Roberts said the policy was a ""toothless solution"". ""It doesn't help the UK's advanced manufacturing sector one iota, because we don't see any of those funds,"" he said. ""We asked the government directly, at ministerial level, to directly support the sector. They listened, but they did nothing. It's almost like they've turned a deaf ear to the needs of advanced manufacturing, which is a key platform of the Industrial Strategy"". He said the government needed to support labour and payroll costs and provide tax reliefs for a period of time while firms recover. ""Production will begin, but it's too late. All of our companies have had six weeks of zero sales and still had to pay their costs,"" Mr Roberts said. The government has said it is in ""daily contact with JLR and cyber experts to listen to concerns and what support can be provided to get production back online.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckge0ex5g27o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c916/live/235006e0-a261-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-05T23:14:18.474000+00:00,c97d9e63dba62b54e2658c28ae9f616bed715442
0774091cfd34,"Conservatives to pledge £5,000 tax rebate for young homebuyers",,"Conservatives to pledge £5,000 tax rebate for young homebuyers Georgia Roberts Political correspondent, Manchester and Kate Whannel Political reporter EPA Conservative Party Leader Kemi Badenoch spoke at the party's conference in Manchester as it began on Sunday The Conservatives will set out plans to ""reward work"" by giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home when they get their first full time job. In his speech to the party's conference in Manchester, shadow chancellor Mel Stride is expected to announce proposals for a ""first-job bonus"" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account. The party says the plans will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget. Sir Mel's speech on Monday is expected to say that there is ""no more pretending we can keep spending money we simply do not have"". Proposals include stopping welfare claims for people with ""low-level mental health problems"" and reducing the number of civil servants by around 132,000, a reduction of around a quarter. Sir Mel will also say his party would reduce aid spending by £7 billion to 0.1% of national income. The conference in Manchester marks almost one year since Kemi Badenoch was elected party leader. In the last 12 months, the party has struggled to counter the political threat posed by Reform UK and suffered heavy defeats in this year's local elections . During their conference, which began on Sunday, the Conservatives are hoping to portray themselves as more competent and more credible - particularly on public spending - than their political rivals. It comes as the Labour government has unveiled major housing market reform plans which will aim to cut costs, reduce delays and halve failed sales. Hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers could benefit from the reforms, in what the government claims would be the biggest house buying shakeup in decades. In his conference speech on Monday, Sir Mel will say: ""We must get on top of government spending. ""We cannot deliver stability unless we live within our means. ""We're the only party that gets it. The only party that will stand up for fiscal responsibility."" His proposals include saving: £23bn from the welfare bill £8bn by bringing civil servant numbers from 517,000 down to 2016 levels of 384,000 £7bn from the overseas aid budget £3.5bn by ending the use of hotels to home asylum seekers £4bn by ensuring benefits and social housing are reserved for UK nationals £1.6bn by scrapping environmental policies, including cutting subsidies for heat pumps and electric vehicles. Earlier this year, the Labour government sought to cut nearly £5bn from the disability and health-related benefits bill but had to backtrack after a rebellion by its own MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has suggested the government will return to the issue, telling the BBC that changes to the welfare system ""must happen"". Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from £64.7bn in 2023-24 to £100.7bn in 2029-30. The Tories argue they can reduce the bill by reviewing exemptions for the Household Benefit Cap, limiting the VAT subsidy for Motability - which allows claimants to lease vehicles - and changing obligations for job-seekers. It says it would stop claims for people suffering from ""low-level health"" mental health problems arguing that ""what is really needed is treatment and support, not cash"". It also says it would keep in place the two-child benefit cap, which prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The Labour government has been under pressure to remove the cap, with many of its backbenchers arguing the limit has increased the number of children in poverty. The Resolution Foundation says axing the cap would lift 470,000 children out of poverty and would cost around £3.5bn. Badenoch has previously defended the cap saying it was a matter of ""fairness"" and Conservatives believed people on benefits ""should have to make the same choices on having children as everyone else"". Earlier this year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to pay for an increase in defence spending. The Conservatives say further reducing spending to 0.1% would save nearly £7bn. Currently, a portion of the existing aid budget is used to pay for hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) think tank welcomed some of the proposals but warned the Conservatives not to ignore ""elephant in the room"" of age-related spending such as pensions. Tom Clougherty, IEA executive director, said: ""Ultimately, no political party is going to be able to balance the books only by cutting things their supporters don't like. ""Without that, other cuts are likely to amount to running to stand still."" The Conservatives have not committed to changing the triple lock, which guarantees that the state pension will go up each year in line with either inflation, wage increases or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. Romilly Greenhill, chief executive of Bond, the network of international development organisations, said the proposed aid budget cuts were ""reckless, short-sighted, and morally indefensible"". The Conservative conference comes six weeks before Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers her Budget on 26 November. During the election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. However, there has been speculation that Reeves will need to raise taxes in order to meet her self-imposed rules for public spending and debt. In a report in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the chancellor only had a ""very small margin"" - £10bn buffer - in which to operate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bbaf/live/ea22b440-a27d-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T01:11:05.703000+00:00,842e3b5a9021f161c1454bdc4feb512a9f2f113c
e7680f31c0bd,Scientists grow mini human brains to power computers,,"Scientists grow mini human brains to power computers Zoe Kleinman Technology editor BBC The building blocks for a biocomputer growing in a lab It may have its roots in science fiction, but a small number of researchers are making real progress trying to create computers out of living cells. Welcome to the weird world of biocomputing. Among those leading the way are a group of scientists in Switzerland, who I went to meet. One day, they hope we could see data centres full of ""living"" servers which replicate aspects of how artificial intelligence (AI) learns - and could use a fraction of the energy of current methods. That is the vision of Dr Fred Jordan, co-founder of the FinalSpark lab I visited. We are all used to the ideas of hardware and software in the computers we currently use. The somewhat eyebrow-raising term Dr Jordan and others in the field use to refer to what they are creating is ""wetware"". In simple terms, it involves creating neurons which are developed into clusters called organoids, which in turn can be attached to electrodes - at which point the process of trying to use them like mini-computers can begin. Dr Jordan acknowledges that, for many people, the very concept of biocomputing is probably a bit weird. ""In science fiction, people have been living with these ideas for quite a long time,"" he said. ""When you start to say, 'I'm going to use a neuron like a little machine', it's a different view of our own brain and it makes you question what we are."" For FinalSpark, the process begins with stem cells derived from human skin cells, which they buy from a clinic in Japan. The actual donors are anonymous. But, perhaps surprisingly, they're not short of offers. ""We have many people who approach us,"" he said. ""But we select only stem cells coming from official suppliers, because the quality of the cells are essential."" Scientists in Vevey, Switzerland are creating biocomputers derived from human skin cells In the lab, FinalSpark's cellular biologist Dr Flora Brozzi handed me a dish containing several small white orbs. Each little sphere is essentially a tiny, lab-grown mini-brain, made out of living stem cells which have been cultured to become clusters of neurons and supporting cells - these are the “organoids”. They are nowhere near the complexity of a human brain, but they have the same building blocks. After undergoing a process which can last several months, the organoids are ready to be attached to an electrode and then prompted to respond to simple keyboard commands. This is a means for electrical signals to be sent and received, with the results recorded on a normal computer hooked up to the system. It's a simple test: you press a key which sends an electric signal through the electrodes, and if it works (it doesn't always) you can just about see a little jump of activity on a screen in response. What's on display is a moving graph which looks a bit like an EEG. I press the key a few times in quick succession, and the responses suddenly stop. Then there's a short, distinctive burst of energy on the chart. When I asked what happened, Dr Jordan said there was a lot they still don't understand about what the organoids do and why. Perhaps I annoyed them. Electrical stimulations are important first steps towards the team's bigger goal of triggering learning in the biocomputer's neurons so they can eventually adapt to perform tasks. ""For AI, it's always the same thing,"" he said. ""You give some input, you want some output that is used. “For instance, you give a picture of a cat, you want the output to say if it's a cat"", he explained. Keeping biocomputers alive Keeping an ordinary computer going is straightforward - it just needs a power supply - but what happens with biocomputers? It's a question scientists don't have an answer for yet. ""Organoids don't have blood vessels,"" said Simon Schultz, professor of Neurotechnology and Director of the Center for Neurotechnology at Imperial College London. ""The human brain has blood vessels that permeate throughout it at multiple scales and provide nutrients to keep it working well. ""We don't yet know how to make them properly. So this is the biggest ongoing challenge."" One thing is for sure though. When we talk about a computer dying, with ""wetware"" that is literally the case. FinalSpark has made some progress in the last four years: its organoids can now survive for up to four months. But there are some eerie findings associated with their eventual demise. Sometimes they observe a flurry of activity from the organoids before they die – similar to the increased heart rate and brain activity which has been observed in some humans at end-of-life. ""There have been a few events when we had a very fast increase in activity just the last minutes or 10s of seconds [of life],"" Dr Jordan said. ""I think we have recorded about 1,000 or 2,000 of these individual deaths across the past five years."" ""It's sad because we have to stop the experiment, understand the reason why it died, and then we do it again,"" he said. Prof Schultz agrees with that unsentimental approach ""We shouldn't be scared of them, they're just computers made out of a different substrate of a different material,"" he said. Real-world applications FinalSpark are not the only scientists working in the biocomputing space. Australian firm Cortical Labs announced in 2022 that it had managed to get artificial neurons to play the early computer game Pong. In the US, researchers at Johns Hopkins University are also building ""mini-brains"" to study how they process information – but in the context of drug development for neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and autism. The hope is that AI will soon be able to supercharge this kind of work. But, for now, Dr Lena Smirnova, who leads the research at Johns Hopkins University, believes wetware is scientifically exciting - but early stage. And she said there is little prospect of it taking the place of the main material currently used for computer chips. ""Biocomputing should complement – not replace – silicon AI, while also advancing disease modelling and reducing animal use,"" she said. Prof Schultz agrees: ""I think they won't be able to out-compete silicon on many things, but we'll find a niche,"" he suggested. Even as the tech comes ever closer to real world applications, however, Dr Jordan is still captivated by its sci-fi origins. ""I've always been fan of science fiction,"" he said. ""When you have a movie of science fiction, or a book, I always felt a bit sad because my life was not like in the book. Now I feel like I'm in the book, writing the book.""

Several major shops in Japan including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart had warned last week that they were running low on stocks of the beer after the hack affected Asahi Group's ordering and delivery systems in the country. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. The partially restarted breweries produce best-seller Asahi Super Dry, but the firm is also restarting plants that produce food and soft drinks. The cyber-attack is the latest to have affected operations at major firms, with carmaker Jaguar Land Rover still struggling to recover from an attack that shut down production. Asahi Group also owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, only Asahi's operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. Asahi said the re-opened beer plants in Japan were ""not yet fully operational"", and that two of its soft drinks factories that have partially re-opened were also not running at full capacity. It added there were a further five soft drinks factories that ""will resume gradually in accordance with shipments."" All seven of its food plants have resumed operations, though they are also not yet fully operational. Asahi said the production systems at the factories themselves had not been affected by the cyber-attack, but it had been forced to halt production because it could not process orders and shipments. On Friday, Asahi said said it was ""unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery"" but that it was working with external cyber-security experts to restore its systems as soon as possible.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yje27je5jo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4091/live/96d37ba0-a29e-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg,2025-10-06T10:06:27.146000+00:00,a6664436206ad028ff74599b9033d9e3564cb039

Do you agree with either of these statements? 

Illegal migrants come here and are a burden on services and the taxpayer. 
OR 
The only way to reduce inequality is to tax billionaires and giant companies who avoid tax.   

They may seem on opposite poles of the political spectrum, but both anti-migrant campaigners and anti-capitalists share an identical mindset. Both are demonstrating zero-sum thinking; the belief that if one group wins, another has to lose. 

In itself, zero-sum thinking isn't moral or immoral, right or wrong. But Economists claim it leads to poor economic policy, and they say evidence shows it is possible to create win-win situations for everyone. 

But many of the main parties at Westminster also use zero-sum thinking in their political rhetoric - from Reform and the Greens, to the Conservatives and Labour. Also, the first past the post electoral system is literally a zero-sum process. So is this kind of thinking baked-into UK politics? 

So are there particular groups of people that are more prone to zero-sum beliefs? Where did this mindset come from? What economic conditions encourage zero-sum thinking, and how deeply are these beliefs held?

4e96194cadfe,Aston Martin warns of losses amid US tariffs,,"Aston Martin warns of losses amid US tariffs Getty Images The firm released a statement on Monday saying it had launched an immediate review into costs Aston Martin Lagonda has warned of further losses as it faces US tariffs, and also raised fears over supply chain pressures from Jaguar Land Rover's cyber-attack fallout. The Warwickshire luxury carmaker said it was now braced for underlying losses greater than £110m, which was the bottom of the previous expected range. The announcement marks the second downgrade to its outlook since early July. Aston Martin bosses said they had launched an ""immediate"" review of costs and spending in light of tougher trading. It sent shares tumbling by as much as 11% at one point during trading on Monday. The firm said wholesale volumes were set to drop by a mid-high single-digit percentage due to ""heightened challenges in the global macroeconomic environment, including the ongoing impact of tariffs"" - with a weaker performance being seen across North America and Asia. Getty Images Aston Martin hopes its Valhalla model will revive its fortunes In a statement on Monday, the firm said: ""The global macroeconomic environment facing the industry remains challenging. ""This includes uncertainties over the economic impact from US tariffs and the implementation of the quota mechanism, changes to China's ultra-luxury car taxes and the increased potential for supply chain pressures, particularly following the recent cyber incident at a major UK automotive manufacturer."" Tariff quotas The group has seen shares come under pressure this year over concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's tariff war. The firm limited shipments to the US in the second quarter after the president imposed a 25% tariff on car imports in April. It then resumed shipments in June as the UK reached an agreement with the US for a lower 10% tariff on UK-made cars for the first 100,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Anything above that threshold will be hit with a 27.5% duty. But Aston Martin said the tariffs were still having an impact on performance. It said: ""For UK automotive manufacturers, the introduction of a US tariff quota mechanism adds a further degree of complexity and limits the group's ability to accurately forecast for this financial year end and, potentially, quarterly from 2026 onwards. ""The group continues to engage with both the US and UK governments to secure greater clarity and certainty."" Aston Martin said while ""positive dialogue"" had been achieved with the US government directly, the firm was still seeking proactive support from the UK.

a750a8860445,Ex-New York Times writer to lead CBS after Paramount deal,,"Ex-New York Times writer to lead CBS after Paramount deal Getty Images Paramount has named former New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, in the latest move by new owners to reshape operations of one of America's leading news organisations. Paramount is also buying The Free Press, the digital outlet Weiss started after her acrimonious departure from the New York Times, in a deal reported to be worth $150m (£112m). Ms Weiss, who has criticised broadcast media for becoming too partisan, said she was excited to put her stamp on CBS, which was taken over by David Ellison earlier this year as part of a wider merger with Paramount. The deal has drawn scrutiny on the left because Mr Ellison is the son of tech billionaire and Trump ally Larry Ellison. Ms Weiss, who started her career working at Jewish news outlets, is known for her support of Israel and her criticism of ""cancel culture"". Since its start as a newsletter in 2021, The Free Press has attracted 1.5 million subscribers, including more than 170,000 paid subscribers. It has drawn attention for reports such as a piece critical of NPR by one of its former business editors, Uri Berliner, as well as an investigation of some photos used by mainstream news outlets to illustrate famine in Gaza, which said many of those featured suffered other health conditions. Big name contributors include historian Niall Ferguson and economist Tyler Cowen. Mr Ellison said the appointment was part of a bigger effort to modernise content at Paramount and make CBS the ""most-trusted name in news"". ""We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home,""  he said. More change at CBS Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Paramount declined to comment on the reports that the firm had paid $150m in stock and cash. Mr Ellison made his name as a Hollywood film producer of blockbusters such as Top Gun Maverick, True Grit and World War Z. He has said his aim is to produce coverage that is less politically skewed, and therefore has the ability to reach all audiences. His takeover of Paramount was approved by the Trump administration this summer, after the company agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 presidential rival Kamala Harris he said was deceptively edited to benefit Democrats. To win approval of the deal, Mr Ellison agreed to install an independent ombudsman at CBS to review complaints of bias and committed to regulators that programming would reflect a diversity of view points. He also said CBS's long-running political show ""Face the Nation"" would no longer air edited interviews. CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS. In a note announcing the deal, Ms Weiss said she believed in the Paramount boss and his leadership team. ""They are doubling down because they believe in news. Because they have courage. Because they love this country. And because they understand, as we do, that America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality,"" she wrote.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwd87ww1vo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/152e/live/6aaf9dc0-a2c0-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg,2025-10-06T15:02:11.153000+00:00,51b629f9d92925df7bfbfd07050aac4620e6a363
11ccfdfa76b7,Food firms scramble to meet the high-protein craze,,"Food firms scramble to meet the high-protein craze Christine Ro Technology Reporter Christine Ro Several months ago Andie started playing around with a fitness app. It recommended that she substantially increase her protein intake. The hard part for her was doing so without also increasing calories. ""So I started trying to find high-protein alternatives to things I was already consuming,"" she explains. This included yogurt, milk, coffee, cereal and pasta. ""I realized that everything tasted pretty much the same to me, and I started then actively seeking these products."" So she was excited when a Canadian restaurant chain introduced high-protein lattes earlier this year. Andie, who did not want to give her surname, drinks them without sweetener, and describes it as a ""decent"" product. Is it a more expensive diet? Living in Vancouver, Andie says prices are already quite high. ""High protein is usually a couple of dollars extra, so it's not a big difference."" Like Andie, you may have noticed on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus a high-protein craze sweeping the food sector. Surveys show consumers increasingly care about the protein content of their food. In the US between March 2024 and March 2025, there was 4.8% volume growth in sales of products labelling themselves as protein-rich, compared to the previous year, according to research group NielsenIQ. Milk has been one beneficiary of the protein craze. Last year saw the first increase in milk consumption since 2009, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture . That's partly being attributed to the enthusiasm for protein. The so-called back-to-cow movement includes products like bovine colostrum, the protein-rich milk cows produce soon after giving birth. The protein trend has been especially driven by the expanded availability of protein from whey, typically a by-product of cheese production. Whey protein is a billion-dollar sector that continues to grow. Getty Images Milk sales have bounced back in the US after years of decline While dairy is doing well, plant-based alternatives to dairy products are going through some lean times. The sales volume of milk alternatives has started to decline, mainly driven by lower consumption in the Americas. Almond milk especially is losing market share. Slowing sales are reflected in slowing chatter online. While US searches for ""oat milk"" outnumbered Google searches for ""whole milk"" in 2020, in 2025, that has reversed. People are searching more for various types of cow milk now than ever before. One reason is the perceived naturalness of foods from cows, including collagen and beef tallow. According to NielsenIQ, milk's global market value is almost eight times larger than that of milk alternatives ($69.3bn; £50.8bn, compared with $8.4bn; £6.2bn). Milk's market value is also growing much faster. Plant-based manufacturers are responding to the demand for high-protein drinks by mentioning protein more on their packaging, and reformulating their products to include more protein. Serena Bolton Federica Amati says the popularity of high-protein foods is down to marketing Nutritionists are often frustrated by the fervour over protein. They point out again and again that most residents of rich countries already consume more protein than they need. The exceptions may be for certain groups, including the severely malnourished, the elderly, women going through menopause, and people with chronic inflammatory conditions. Federica Amati is a research fellow at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is also the head nutritionist for the nutrition company Zoe. Dr Amati worries that ""people are being hoodwinked into thinking 'high protein' on a label necessarily means that it is healthy. Honestly, it's another health halo."" While excess consumption of protein is not likely to harm most people's health, ""consuming more protein than your body can use during midlife is linked to an increased risk of multiple diseases, including cancer,"" Dr Amati warns. ""An important point on this, though, is that plant-based sources of protein don't seem to increase cancer risk."" And because most people don't have unlimited money to spend on food, high-protein products could be an unhelpful distraction. ""The price of fresh whole foods is going up so shoppers are best off buying more whole foods, and the standard already high-whey natural Greek yogurt without the markup,"" Dr Amati comments. ""And remember, most of us can get plenty of the protein we need if we're eating enough whole foods."" If anything should be seen as a hero nutrient, according to many nutritionists, it should be fibre rather than protein. Dr Amati believes: ""The popularity of high-protein products in general is entirely due to marketing. Manufacturers can easily [and cheaply] add extra protein to their products and whack the price up."" Verley Stéphane Mac Millan wants the dairy industry to ""move into the 21st century"" Businesses are responding to that demand. At French start-up Verley a gleaming row of stainless steel tanks, called fermentors, hold special microorganisms being fed on sugars. Eventually they'll produce beta-lactoglobulin, a protein found in whey. The team at Verley, a French startup, will then purify the protein, including extracting the lactose. The end result is a high-protein powder that is essentially dairy, but which Verley says is suitable for vegans as no cows are involved. The process is both traditional and cutting-edge, believes Stéphane Mac Millan, Verley's CEO. On the one hand, fermentation has a long history in French food culture, including in cheesemaking. On the other hand, Verley wants to modernise dairy by honing the nutritional benefits while reducing the environmental impacts. Dairy production requires large amounts of water and land, while generating large amounts of greenhouse gases. ""A goal really is to help the dairy industry move into the 21st century,"" Mr Mac Millan says. Mr Mac Millan is betting that nutrition-conscious consumers will care increasingly not only about getting enough whey protein, but about getting specific forms of it. He says that some US consumers are now seeking out beta-lactoglobulin, which is high in the amino acid leucine, rather than non-specific whey protein. The increasing number of people using weight-loss injections could also help drive the company's growth, Mr Mac Millan believes. People concerned about rapidly losing muscle might reach for high-protein products. He acknowledges that Verley's protein will be more expensive than whey protein initially. ""But considering that we are bringing more to the table and we are sustainable, it's normal that there is a premium."" The company is also hoping to bring costs down with greater scale. It is currently seeking regulatory approval in various countries. Overall, when it comes to nutrition, the general public is more likely to listen to friends, families and influencers than to experts like him, acknowledges Jack Bobo, executive director of the Rothman Family Institute for Food Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This is partly related to the aspirational nature of much fitness content on social media, particularly targeting young men. Most viewers and listeners are not elite athletes, but many are seeking to eat and drink as if they were. One difficulty is that consumers are somewhat fickle. Soymilk is among the cheapest and highest-protein alternative milks, yet it has lost ground to the newcomers even as the protein craze has intensified. And social media moves faster than the people making or regulating food. For the time being, it seems to be smart business to focus on protein - whether it's truly beneficial or not.

One-star reviews and a sense of injustice have dominated online discussion since the popular messaging app Snapchat became the latest tech firm to put a price tag on a service people previously enjoyed using for free . The app's parent company Snap announced in September it would start charging people if they have more than five gigabytes worth of previously shared images and videos saved as Memories. For many, these retro posts act as a window to the past - leading some to accuse the firm of ""corporate greed"" in posts on social media and negative reviews on Google and Apple's app stores. Snap has compared its paid storage plans to those provided by Apple and Google for smartphones. And as an alternative for those who don't want to pay, users can download their Memories , which for some span tens of gigabytes of data, to their device. The firm told the BBC only a small number of users would be affected by the changes. It also acknowledged it was ""never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it"" - but suggested it would be ""worth the cost"" for users. Many criticising the move online seem to disagree. An online petition dubbed the fee a ""memory tax"", with commenters calling it ""dystopian"" and ""ridiculous"" - while one person threatened never to use the app again. Meanwhile, in a one-star review on the Google Play store, a person calling themselves Natacha Jonsson said it felt ""very unethical"". ""If I know millennials right, most of us have years worth of memories on Snapchat,"" they said. ""And most of us only kept the app mainly for that reason. ""5GB is absolutely nothing when you have years worth of memories... Bye Snap."" And Guste Ven, a 20-year-old journalism student in London, shared on TikTok her plans to delete the app. Allow TikTok content? This article contains content provided by TikTok.

Snapchat has not yet said how much storage plans would cost in the UK - only that they are part of a ""gradual global rollout"". But 23-year-old Amber Daley, who also lives in London, said in a post on TikTok she would be ""distraught"" by such charges. Allow TikTok content? This article contains content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’ . Accept and continue Amber told the BBC the app had become ""a part of everyday life"" since she started using it in 2014. While she said she understood the platform needed to make money, Amber suggested the Memories feature means more to users than the company may have realised. ""I think it's quite an unfair move to charge your customers who have been loyal and devoted,"" she said. ""These aren't just called Memories, these are our actual memories."" 'Emotional artefacts' Companies deciding to charge users for a service that was previously free is nothing new, and millions pay for services like iCloud and Google Drive to backup their photos and videos from their smartphone. The reality of storing data in the cloud - which some in the tech industry like to refer to as simply ""somebody else's computer"" - is it costs money. ""Hosting trillions of Memories on Snapchat isn't a trivial amount,"" social media consultant Matt Navarra told the BBC. ""Snapchat has to try to find a way to cover the cost of storage, bandwidth, back-ups, content delivery, encryption - all that stuff."" Bloomberg via Getty Images Evan Spiegel, Snap's boss, said in September that the company was poised to reach one billion Snapchat users and generate ""record revenues"" But Mr Navarra said introducing fees for a service that had previously been free, and users had been encouraged to use as such, may feel like a ""bait and switch"" for some. ""Moving the goalposts after people have built this huge digital archive doesn't really sit right,"" he said. And for many, he added, ""Memories aren't just data dumps, they're emotional artefacts"". The feeling was shared by those leaving critical reviews, with one person calling their Snapchat photos and videos ""the most precious thing to me"". ""[Memories] have every aspect of my life within them from celebrations of new family members' births, mourning of passed loved ones, memories with friends/family, [and] my whole teenage years,"" they wrote. Dr Taylor Annabell, a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said Snapchat's move shows the implications of commercial platforms being used to store sentimental personal content. ""They benefit from this trust, interdependence, and presumption of never-ending access, which even incentivises some users to remain with the platform or continue to use it in order to scroll back through their archive,"" she told the BBC. ""But these are not benevolent guardians of personal memory.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5ypl6nkzo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d504/live/11b47050-a06e-11f0-8687-4726d7177866.jpg,2025-10-06T23:40:34.755000+00:00,eb3f99300c5a332345e406addc1413ae015f415e
104cfabedac2,Shutdown to continue after funding measures fail again in Senate,,"The Senate on Monday failed for a fifth time to pass spending measures reopening the government. Competing proposals by Democrats and Republicans were both shot down, failing to meet the 60-vote threshold required. President Donald Trump said earlier in the day that another failed vote would trigger mass layoffs. Thousands of federal employees were furloughed or ordered to work without pay when funding for their agencies ended five days ago. But he hinted that he was open to trying to end the impasse and possibly strike a deal with Democrats who are sticking to demands that the legislation address healthcare. Republicans are pressing for a ""clean"" funding bill. The Democratic-led bill to extend the government's funding failed first on Monday with a 45-50 vote. Its Republican counterpart then fell short at 52-42. Soon after the vote, Trump took to social media to blame Democrats for shutting down the government. ""I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform. Democrats have held out on supporting the Republican-led proposal because they say it undercuts medical access for lower-income Americans. They want any funding bill to ensure health insurance subsidies for lower-income Americans do not expire and reverse the Trump administration's cuts to the Medicaid health programme. Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants - something that Democratic leaders deny. They have also said that they will work on the healthcare issue in separate legislation, after the government reopens. Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said he is currently negotiating with Democratic leadership on possible healthcare provisions. ""We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things. And I'm talking about good things with regard to healthcare,"" he said. But Chuck Schumer, Democrats' leader in the Senate, then posted a clip of Trump's remarks to X with the statement ""THIS ISN'T TRUE"". The White House has warned since the shutdown started last Wednesday that permanent firings of federal employees are ""imminent"". Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that on Monday, saying the Office of Management and Budget is already working with agencies who will have to lay people off. ""We don't want to see people laid off. But unfortunately, if this shutdown continues, layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,"" she said. Leavitt on Monday called on Democratic lawmakers to relent. ""There's nothing to negotiate. Just reopen the government,"" she said. In separate interviews with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, and top Republican, Speaker Mike Johnson, each blamed the other's party for the continued stand-off. Jeffries accused Republicans of ""lying"" about Democrats' intentions in the negotiations ""because they're losing the court of public opinion"". But Johnson said Democrats were ""not serious"" and negotiating in bad faith. ""They're doing this to get political cover,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5q0zzdepeo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b3ac/live/eee977c0-a304-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T23:07:18.389000+00:00,447f4be939c017b760be102719968a0635c32483
12b992efd714,Chinese EV giant BYD sees UK sales soar by 880%,,"Chinese car making giant BYD says the UK has become its biggest market outside China, after its sales there surged by 880% in September compared to a year earlier. The company says it sold 11,271 cars in the UK last month, with the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV) accounting for the majority of those sales. It comes after figures from the car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed that sales of electric vehicles (EVs) jumped to a record high in September. The UK is particularly attractive to firms like BYD as the country has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike other major markets such as the European Union and the US. BYD, which offers cheaper models than many of its Western rivals, said its share of the UK market jumped to 3.6% in September. The company will launch more new hybrid and electric cars in the months ahead, said the BYD's UK manager Bono Ge. He added that the brand's future in Britain looks ""hugely exciting"", having just opened its 100th retail outlet. UK EV sales hit a record high last month, with sales of pure battery electric vehicles rising to almost 73,000, according to the SMMT. Sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster, it said. The Kia Sportage, Ford Puma and Nissan Qashqai were the best-selling cars in September. Chinese models - the Jaecoo 7 and BYD Seal U - were also in the top 10. But despite the surge in overall EV sales in the UK, petrol and diesel vehicles still made up more than half of new car sales last month, according to the SMMT. In October last year, the EU announced it would hit imports of Chinese EVs with levies of up to 45%. The measure is aimed to protect European car makers from being undermined by what the EU believes are unfair Chinese-state subsidies. Chinese car makers like BYD have been effectively shut out of the US by high tariffs, which were backed by both President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5jl2jgqwo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d7ed/live/2ae1d7d0-a315-11f0-9a7f-5f5a0ca3c32d.jpg,2025-10-07T02:39:38.853000+00:00,b9192a889b415318caafa0e5ddaea86bd77a4ab9
6b017dab113e,Guernsey States budget for 2026 'not exciting',,"Guernsey States budget for 2026 'not exciting' John Fernandez Guernsey political reporter BBC Deputy Lindsay de Sausmarez said a £600 increase in personal income tax allowances would help people with the cost of living Further tax breaks for landlords, new taxes on vaping and higher personal income tax allowances could all be agreed next month as part of Policy and Resources' (P&R) budget for 2026. In setting out the budget, P&R stated the States faced a deficit of £48m and that ""long-term structural balance must remain the primary focus of this assembly"". Despite this, only £1.2m in revenue-raising measures have been proposed, including above-inflation increases to taxes on cigarettes, petrol, and property. P&R President Lindsay de Sausmarez described the 2025 budget as ""not exciting"". A decision on broader tax reform - including whether GST [goods and sales tax] should apply to food, and whether companies should pay more tax on their income - is expected before June next year. Why is there a deficit? De Sausmarez blamed a shrinking working population, increased demand on health services and the fact people were living longer locally for the island's financial challenges. He said: ""To balance the books, we're proposing some modest increases in some taxes and duties, combined with some savings through reductions in expenditure."" Last month, the BBC reported that committees had asked for about £30m above their budgets and had been rebuffed, with P&R Vice-president Gavin St Pier having labelled the requests ""completely unaffordable"" . Upon publishing the budget, De Sausmarez said: ""Committees have not been given all that they have asked for, but we hope our colleagues appreciate the need for fiscal restraint in the current circumstances."" Budget 2026 in under 60 seconds P&R has recommended increases for committees of £12m above the initial cash limits. The States' chief executive has been tasked with finding £4m of savings next year. Tax breaks for landlords If the budget is approved at the States meeting starting on 4 November, the increased rate of document duty for property transactions that are not people's principal residence will be removed. The move is to try and stimulate the island's rental sector where, according to De Sausmarez, a lack of rental stock had been causing rents to rocket. Recent figures showed the average local market rent was £2,068 a month in the first quarter of 2025 - 1.5% higher than the previous quarter, 8.2% higher than the first quarter of 2024 and 51.7% higher than five years ago. As part of the 2026 budget, in an effort to improve the quality of rental properties, the tax relief which can be claimed for property maintenance by landlords could also increase. What's going up? The amount of money people take home in their pay packet is set to go up by £600, as personal income tax allowances could increase to £15,200. De Sauamarez said this was the primary measure in the budget to support people with the cost of living. Tax on tobacco will increase by 13.7%, which equates to an extra £1.12 on a pack of cigarettes; while fuel duty is increasing at a rate higher than the cost of living is increasing, meaning a litre of petrol on average will cost 3.7p more. Domestic property tax is also set for an above-inflation increase to 8.7%, with commercial rates set to increase by 5.4%. As previously reported by the BBC, a new tax of £2.20 per 10ml of vape liquid is set to be introduced, with retailers saying they were ""concerned"" about the impact on the local industry. Registering a new car could cost more next year as well, with the first registration duty going up by 8.7%. What does it mean for GST? The big levers of taxation are not being touched in this budget, as a review of the island's corporate tax system and the planned introduction of a GST are currently under way. Decisions on major infrastructure projects including whether the States will build a new dairy will be made next year. One project which has secured funding in the budget is the island's only sexual assault referral centre, which had originally been funded until the end of 2025.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98d044r4m1o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1eb4/live/a6b505e0-a2bf-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg,2025-10-07T05:21:45.950000+00:00,21df3532841b912c1cf97e0be005c038df79a326

Campaigners in Highfield, Gateshead, say they are charged higher prices at the Tesco Express in Rowlands Gill compared with larger Tesco and rival brand stores in the town centre. Marie Sidgwick, 65, who lives in Rowlands Gill, said: ""Desperate people are having to pay the price because they cannot afford to make the £5 bus trip to Gateshead and it's all wrong."" A Tesco spokesperson said the company offers a range of everyday products in its Express stores at the same price charged in larger stores, but shoppers say many cheaper items are not stocked in the smaller outlets. Ms Sidgwick said: ""There are a lot of people who are having a real hard time paying their bills and affording food and Tesco should really help. ""We haven't got a bigger or cheaper store."" Crisps, lentils, pasta, milk and meat are among some of the products villagers say are being stocked at a higher price rather than within the value range of products. Prices in the Rowlands Gill shop can be 15% more expensive than in the large Tesco, where chilli con carne is £1.81 and stewed steak is £3 Diane Kindred, who works at Gateshead Food Bank, said she understands Tesco needs to make a profit, but cheaper value brands are not being stocked. ""Penne pasta for example,"" she said. ""The Tesco brand is 69p but their value range is only 41p. ""That's a big difference, and the Express store is choosing the 69p bag. ""Tesco Express are deemed as convenience stores so generally the prices are higher, but for the Highfield residents this isn't a convenience store, it is an essential supermarket. ""You can't do a weekly shop on the bus, some of the residents are vulnerable and elderly and are not digitally savvy to do an online shop either."" Diane Kindred Diane Kindred from Gateshead Food Bank has joined the villagers' campaign According to a 2023 Competition & Markets Authority report it costs more to run a convenience store due to them requiring more deliveries of lower volumes while having relatively greater staffing levels and higher rents. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said big brand smaller shops faced the same issues as independent retailers in terms of costs. ""These costs often to lead to slightly higher prices than the larger superstores which benefit from economies of scale,"" he said. ""Overall, these stores are intended as a way of supporting customers for smaller shops rather than replacing the need for large-format stores."" The report said prices in convenience store outlets of major supermarkets tend to be about 10% higher than a large store of the same brand.

27b8a4721173,Urgent winter clothing appeal for baby banks,,"Urgent winter clothing appeal for baby banks Getty Images Baby banks in London say they need more donations to help families through the winter A network of baby banks in London is urgently appealing for donations to help support families with young children this winter with clothes, blankets and other supplies. The charity Little Village, which represents a number of baby banks in the capital, told the BBC that supplies at their hubs were running low due to more families facing increased financial pressures. A survey by the charity found 81% of parents it currently helps felt they could not afford warm coats, boots or jumpers for their children. CEO Sophie Livingstone said increasing winter costs were ""robbing parents of sleep and peace of mind,"" and she urged people to donate ""before the cold sets in."" Parents feeling anxious Little Village, which has hubs in Camden, Wandsworth, Brent, Hackney and Hounslow, receives referrals to its services from local community professionals, such as midwives, who come across families in need. The charity has previously told the BBC how it struggles to keep up with demand. Its recent survey of families it helps found nearly two-thirds worry about food, nappies, wipes, and heating costs. Little Village said the research also revealed that parents were feeling stressed, anxious or could not sleep. During 2024 it distributed 6,752 coats, 14,163 pairs of shoes, 2,857 blankets, 1,472 items of bedding and 45,220 pairs of socks to families in need. Parents are referred to the charity and are helped with clothes and other supplies, depending on their need One mother supported by Little Village explained: ""During the winter months, my family and I experience significant financial pressures. ""Heating and electricity bills increase and keeping the home warm becomes a major expense. ""At the same time, we often need to buy warmer clothing and additional household items to cope with the cold, which adds to our financial strain. ""We have to make difficult choices, such as cutting back on other essentials, just to get through the season."" Little Village TV presenter Christine Lampard and Renata Acioli, a baby bank manager at Little Village The charity's appeal is supported by TV presenter Christine Lampard who said: ""The fact that some little ones out there are facing the winter without something warm to wear is heart-breaking - as a mum, it just hits different. ""You know how quickly kids grow out of things, and those coats and boots still have so much life in them. ""If you've got bits your kids have grown out of, please pass them on.

76b5f34fc514,Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity,,"Renewables overtake coal as world's biggest source of electricity Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor AFP via Getty Images Renewable energy overtook coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year - a historic first, according to new data from the global energy think tank Ember. Electricity demand is growing around the world but the growth in solar and wind was so strong it met 100% of the extra electricity demand, even helping drive a slight decline in coal and gas use. However, Ember says the headlines mask a mixed global picture. Developing countries, especially China, led the clean energy charge but richer nations including the US and EU relied more than before on planet-warming fossil fuels for electricity generation. Coal, a major contributor to global warming, was still the world's largest individual source of energy generation in 2024, a position it has held for more than 50 years, according to the International Energy Agency. China remains way ahead in clean energy growth, adding more solar and wind capacity than the rest of the world combined. This enabled the growth in renewable generation in China to outpace rising electricity demand and helped reduce its fossil fuel generation by 2%. India experienced slower electricity demand growth and also added significant new solar and wind capacity, meaning it too cut back on coal and gas. In contrast, developed nations like the US, and also the EU, saw the opposite trend. In the US, electricity demand grew faster than clean energy output, increasing reliance on fossil fuels, while in the EU, months of weak wind and hydropower performance led to a rise in coal and gas generation. Getty Images 'Crucial' turning point Despite these regional differences, Ember calls this moment a ""crucial turning point"". Ember senior analyst Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka said it ""marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth"". Solar power delivered the lion's share of growth, meeting 83% of the increase in electricity demand. It has now been the largest source of new electricity globally for three years in a row. Most solar generation (58%) is now in lower-income countries, many of which have seen explosive growth in recent years. That's thanks to spectacular reductions in cost. Solar has seen prices fall a staggering 99.9% since 1975 and is now so cheap that large markets for solar can emerge in a country in the space of a single year, especially where grid electricity is expensive and unreliable, says Ember. Pakistan, for example, imported solar panels capable of generating 17 gigawatts (GW) of solar power in 2024, double the previous year and the equivalent of roughly a third of the country's current electricity generation capacity. Africa is also experiencing a solar boom with panel imports up 60% year on year, in the year to June. Coal-heavy South Africa led the way, while Nigeria overtook Egypt into second place with 1.7GW of solar generating capacity - that's enough to meet the electricity demand of roughly 1.8m homes in Europe. Some smaller African nations have seen even more rapid growth with Algeria increasing imports 33-fold, Zambia eightfold and Botswana sevenfold. In some countries the growth of solar has been so rapid it is creating unexpected challenges. In Afghanistan, widespread use of solar-powered water pumps is lowering the water table, threatening long-term access to groundwater. A study by Dr David Mansfield and satellite data firm Alcis warns that some regions could run dry within five to ten years, endangering millions of livelihoods. Adair Turner, chair of the UK's Energy Transitions Commission, says countries in the global ""sun belt"" and ""wind belt"" face very different energy challenges. Sun belt nations - including much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America - need large amounts of electricity for daytime air conditioning. These countries can significantly reduce energy costs almost immediately by adopting solar-based systems, supported by increasingly affordable batteries that store energy from day to night. Wind belt countries like the UK face tougher obstacles, however. Wind turbine costs have not come down by anything like as much as solar panels - down just a third or so in the last decade. Higher interest rates have also added to borrowing costs and raised the overall price of installing wind farms significantly in the last few years. Balancing supply is harder too: winter wind lulls can last for weeks, requiring backup power sources that batteries alone can't provide - making the system more expensive to build and run. But wherever you are in the world, China's overwhelming dominance in clean tech industries remains unchallenged, other new data from Ember shows. In August 2025, its clean tech exports hit a record $20bn, driven by surging sales of electric vehicles (up 26%) and batteries (up 23%). Together, China's electric vehicles and batteries are now worth more than twice the value of its solar panel exports.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/43c1/live/9d78fac0-a2e4-11f0-ba2e-7d74c4f6f1cb.jpg,2025-10-07T00:02:03.184000+00:00,e83edb56c3d8e51a6026457ab0113b7f52ebe8d9
578c0a7f067b,JLR to restart production on Wednesday after cyber-attack,,"Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed that output at some of its manufacturing sites will resume on Wednesday, as it continues to recover from a serious cyber-attack. Its production lines have been at a standstill since the start of September, following the attack. The phased return of staff will begin at some sites in the West Midlands and Merseyside. JLR has also announced a programme to fast-track payments to its direct suppliers, some of which had laid off workers after their revenues dried up following the hack. Initially the scheme will be confined to the most critical suppliers needed for restarting production, but it will be expanded at a later date. JLR says the phased restart will begin at its Wolverhampton engine plant in Wolverhampton and its battery assembly centre in Hams Hall. Employees who work in facilities which prepare pressed metal bodywork at the company's sites in Castle Bromwich, Halewood and Solihull will also be brought back in – as will those who work in the Solihull car plant's body shop and paint shop. JLR says this move will be ""closely followed"" by the resumption of vehicle manufacturing in Nitra, Slovakia. The Range Rover and Range Rover Sport production lines in Solihull are expected to restart later in the week. It is not yet clear when output will resume at JLR's Halewood plant on Merseyside. Experts have warned that it is still likely to be several weeks before the production lines are running as normal. JLR has also outlined an accelerated-payment scheme to help its suppliers, many of whom have been struggling financially. So-called Tier 1 suppliers, with which the company has a direct relationship, will be able to get paid for new orders shortly after they have been placed, rather than up to two months after delivery. JLR says this will enable them to get funding up to 120 days earlier than normal. There is an expectation that these companies will then offer similar terms to their own suppliers, allowing funding to flow rapidly down the supply chain. The scheme is being funded by JLR itself, using credit provided by a commercial bank. It is not linked to the £1.5bn loan guarantee recently offered to the carmaker by the government. Industry insiders have warned that the resumption of production, while welcome, does not end the crisis being experienced by many smaller suppliers. Some are heavily reliant on JLR and have had little or no income for the past month and a half, while bills have still had to be paid. Last week, one leading contractor told the BBC that the help offered by the government so far was inadequate. David Roberts of Evtec Group said: ""We asked the government directly, at ministerial level, to directly support the sector. They listened, but they did nothing. It's almost like they've turned a deaf ear to the needs of advanced manufacturing.""

Bosses said they have ""explored every possible alternative"" and have not ruled out further job losses across the industry without government intervention. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise this will be difficult for affected workers and their families, and we continue to engage with Ineos and the wider sector to explore potential solutions that will ensure a viable chemicals industry in the UK."" David Brooks, chief executive of Ineos Acetyls, said it was a ""very difficult time"" for the ""highly skilled"" team at the Hull facility and the decision to cut jobs was ""was not taken lightly"". He said: ""We have explored every possible alternative but in the face of sustained pressure from energy costs, combined with unfairly low-cost imports into the UK and Europe, we've been left with no other choice.""

Mr Brooks said: ""Our priority now is to support those affected and protect the long-term future of the site."" ""This is not an isolated issue. It is part of the same structural crisis that is hitting chemicals companies across the UK and EU,"" he added.

2a84789161d3,MrBeast: AI means it's 'scary times' for YouTube creators,,"The world's biggest YouTuber, MrBeast, says the rapid advance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is ""scary"" for the ""millions of creators currently making content for a living"". AI tools that can create fully-formed videos from simple text prompts by users have made rapid advances in recent years. The most recent of these, OpenAI's Sora - which was released last week - has attracted scrutiny for the ease with which people can reproduce copyrighted characters and material. On social media, MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, asked what would happen to people like him ""when AI videos are just as good as normal videos"". Fears about the impact AI will have on the jobs market are widespread - but particularly acute in the creative industries. In the film and video game industries, there has been extensive industrial action over the use of AI. Those concerns were recently reignited over a headline-making AI actor. However, AI is also being widely used in the same sectors. For example, YouTube offers the use of generative AI for content creators, including generating videos through Google's Veo tool. AI can also be used to auto-generate subtitles or to hone ideas and scripts. Some YouTube videos are fully AI-generated - for example long videos which people might put on to help them go to sleep, says Lars Erik Holmquist, professor of design and innovation at Nottingham Trent University. However, ""the general trend of what we're looking at AI as a tool [is] it makes creativity so much cheaper,"" he says. ""I think the people that win in the short term will be just those who use it to create really good content,"" he adds. For creators like MrBeast, it is unlikely that he will be replaced by AI-generated videos. ""His whole idea is to make people do uncomfortable or dangerous things for money - and if it wasn't real, nobody would watch it,"" says Prof Holmquist. But, given his huge profile, interrupting his usual feed on X - usually promoting his videos - to speak about this is significant. Where AI could be useful to creators like MrBeast is behind the scenes, such as in production or graphics. In fact, he tried that earlier this year - but faced a backlash from other creators when he released an AI tool which generated thumbnails for videos. But other prominent YouTubers pointed out the controversy around what generative AI is trained on - with some arguing it steals copyrighted material without paying the creators. MrBeast removed the tools from his analytics platform and instead provided links to human designers. Veo, Google's AI video generator, is trained on a subset of YouTube videos - though it is not known how many, and whether MrBeast's videos are included in the training data.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zmm0ry67o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d2e/live/52bcf7c0-a35c-11f0-9ba1-d9aaa400322a.jpg,2025-10-07T11:15:05.601000+00:00,8c10047aa8a3d7b24b69fa2e63e217fc3b3a120f
40323cb80acd,"North Korean hackers stealing record sums, researchers say",,"Hackers linked to the North Korean regime have so far stolen more than $2bn (£1.49bn) according to researchers who say 2025 is a record-breaking year for the country's cyber criminals. The thefts now account for around 13% of the secretive country's gross domestic product (GDP), according to United Nations' estimates. Western security agencies say these funds are used to finance North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development programs. For the last few years operatives from hacking teams like Lazarus Group have focussed on attacking cryptocurrency companies for large thefts of digital tokens. The worst of these attacks came in February this year when hackers swiped $1.4bn from crypto exchange ByBit . But the new research from investigators at research firm Elliptic warns the cyber-criminals are also increasingly targeting individuals who hold large amounts of crypto. High net worth individuals have become increasingly attractive targets as they often lack the security measures employed by businesses, researchers warn. Dr Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic, says the targeting of individuals - which is less likely to be disclosed - means the true figure for hacks carried out by North Korea could be even higher. ""Other thefts are likely unreported and remain unknown as attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science."" ""We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed,"" he says. North Korea's UK embassy was approached for comment but did not immediately respond. Previously the regime has denied any involvement in hacks. Elliptic and other companies like Chainalysis are able to track the movement of stolen funds like Bitcoin and Ethereum by following the public list of transactions on the blockchain. Over the years researchers have noticed patterns in methods and tools favoured by North Korean hackers. Elliptic estimates that 2025's bumper year so far takes the cumulative known value of cryptoassets stolen by the regime to more than $6 billion. As well as the ByBit hack in February, Elliptic analysts have attributed more than 30 other attacks to North Korea so far this year. An attack on WOO X in July that saw $14 million stolen from 9 users. Another case led to $1.2m of digital coins stolen from Seedify. This year's activity dwarfs the regime's previous record set in 2022 when it is accused of stealing $1.35 billion in total. As well as a prolific cyber crime team, the regime is increasingly being accused of operating an elaborate fake IT workers programme to bring in additional money and skirt international sanctions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8z7wxe03o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9e82/live/6ccdd9e0-a370-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png,2025-10-07T12:07:08.459000+00:00,0b91812d1d3ab8376261cf984f68c73c0d4ccbf3

The row could see up to 1,300 drivers refuse to work for three days after DPD said it was cutting the amount it pays for deliveries of small parcels by 65p. One driver told the BBC this could cost him about £6,500 a year. The lower rate applies to those who are self-employed or franchised, which is the majority of DPD drivers. DPD said it did not expect the the action by the drivers to have a ""significant impact"" on its services, and added that it had increased pay rates for the delivery of larger parcels. Several drivers told the BBC they were given only a few hours notice before the cut came into effect in late September. DPD said it had ""adjusted some of our rates to reflect changes in our parcel traffic profile"". It said driver stops which include only smaller parcels would see a reduction of 65p. Stops which include larger parcels, or high-value or pharmaceutical parcels would see no change, DPD said, while heavier deliveries would get an extra 65p. The company also said it had introduced new incentive payments, ""designed to increase earnings all year round"". ""As a result, we believe our driver remuneration package remains among the best in our industry,"" it said. But one driver said the changes would cut his income by about £25 a day, or around £6,500 a year, which would make it ""difficult"" for him to manage his household costs. Another driver said that even with the increased rate for larger parcels, there is ""no way"" he could make up the losses resulting from the 65p cut. ""We just don't get that many larger parcels to make up for the loss resulting from the rate cut in smaller parcels,"" he told the BBC. ""And even if we did take on more larger parcels, we would have to work longer and do more stops just to earn the same amount as before the cut."" The drivers taking part in the action will refuse to deliver parcels on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week. DPD said: ""We acknowledge that some drivers have raised concerns regarding the new arrangements, and these are being addressed. ""However, a small number of drivers at various depots have chosen not to operate today.

d9d9733f5806,More holidaymakers using AI to plan trips,,"More holidaymakers using AI to plan trips Michael Sheils McNamee Business reporter Getty Images More holidaymakers are turning to AI when planning or booking their trips, according to travel association ABTA. The body found that 8% of travellers were using AI - up from 4% last year - with younger holidaymakers more likely to use the technology when planning their trips. However, AI still lagged a long way behind more established methods - such as general internet searches and asking family and friends. Overall, the number of people taking a holiday continued a recent trend of climbing back towards pre-pandemic levels, ABTA said. The travel body described the increase in customers using AI as ""both a challenge and an opportunity"". ABTA chief executive Mark Tanzer said AI was ""something travel businesses have been using behind the scenes for the last few years"" and was growing in popularity for travellers. There has been speculation about the size of the threat AI poses to high street and online travel agents - with AI booking agents now capable of taking actions on behalf of customers. OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, recently partnered with online platforms Booking.com and Expedia to allow travel planners to do more through the popular AI chatbot. ABTA's survey covered 2,000 people. While AI is growing in popularity, 48% of those surveyed used general internet searching when planning their trips, 41% asked friends and family,  while 36% looked at travel websites and guidebooks. At the moment, less than a fifth of respondents said they would be happy to hand over the planning or booking of their holiday to AI - something which ABTA said may reflect the relative infancy of the tech and the ""quality and reliability"" of information . Holly Hyde, from London, and who has travelled to 78 countries, increasingly uses AI to help her plan her holidays. ""I started using it in the last year or so, purely because I always liked using a travel agent. ""But my friends who used to work in [the industry], no longer do. Rather than developing a relationship with a new agent, I started using ChatGPT."" Having previously worked in luxury and corporate travel, she said using AI was an ""easy start point"", and recently used it to give recommendations to a relative who was going on holiday with their boyfriend for the first time, and wanted to fly directly to somewhere with temperatures in the low-20s in early January. Holly Hyde Holly, who has travelled to 78 countries, said she would continue to use AI to plan her holidays - but that it had its limitations While ChatGPT quickly produced a list of suitable destinations in Spain and North Africa - Ms Hyde said she would still use a travel agent for bigger trips. ""If I was going to Costa Rica, or central America, for security reasons - you need the destination knowledge from someone who knows somewhere inside out."" More holidays taken Overall, ABTA report suggested an increase in the percentage of people who have taken a holiday over the previous year - up to 87%, the highest total since the pandemic. This accounted for holidays in the UK and abroad, which both saw an increase. Spain remained the most popular travel destination abroad, being selected by just under a third of travellers, with France, Italy, the USA, and Greece rounding out the top five. And despite concerns over global news events, ABTA found travel demand remained resilient. More than nine out of 10 respondents said conflicts such as those in the Middle East and Ukraine, or the political turmoil in the United States, did not put them off travelling in general.

5f406371dcf9,Trump's farmer bailout raises concern about trade war 'winners and losers',,"Trump's farmer bailout raises concern about trade war 'winners and losers' Natalie Sherman Business reporter and Danielle Kaye Business reporter Brad Smith Brad Smith, a farmer who grows soybeans and corn in Illinois, says government aid could help him stay in business Businesses across the US have been crying out for months about the damage inflicted by sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump imposed earlier this year. Now one group is poised to get relief: farmers. President Trump has said his administration is developing plans to send billions of dollars in support to farmers, especially growers of soybeans, who have been hurt as purchases from China - the world's biggest buyer of the legume - have dried up this year. The plan is a reprise of the bailout Trump extended to farmers hit by the trade wars of his first term and reflects pressure he is facing from a key part of his voter base over the consequences of his tariff policies. But the plans have frustrated many other kinds of businesses that have also been hurt, as the new taxes on imports raise costs for firms based in the US and alienate long-time customers overseas. ""It just seems like a blatant political move,"" said Justin Turbeest, a craft brewer in Hudson, Wisconsin, who shut his tap room and laid off 20 staff this summer. He said tariffs were the final blow for his business, prompting costs to jump roughly 40%, as suppliers of everything from aluminium cans and barley to brand merchandise raised prices. Mr Turbeest acknowledged that offering wider relief would be impractical, given the vast number of businesses affected. But the 42-year-old said the discrepancy still stung. ""On a personal level, of course it feels unfair,"" he said. ""The position we're in now is due not to normal economic factors. It's political costs."" Justin Turbeest Justin Turbeest (R) had to lay off staff this summer, though he is hoping his Hop & Barrel brand lives on with a recent franchising deal 'Picking winners and losers' Alexis D'Amato, from the Small Business Majority, said her advocacy group was not opposed to relief, especially for small farms, but felt that small businesses should be included. ""We don't agree with picking winners and losers in this tariff fight,"" she said. The Trump administration has said it is responding to retaliation from China, after Beijing halted purchases of American soybeans earlier this year. But other industries, like wine and distilled spirits, have seen sharp drops in exports too. Wine exports are down 30% this year, according to the California Wine Institute, while exports of distilled spirits to Canada have dropped 85% this year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Canada recently lifted most of the tariffs it had placed on US goods, but American alcohol remains banned from the shelves in several Canadian provinces. Distilled Spirits Council president Chris Swonger said he understood the need to provide farmers with relief. But he added: ""Our industry should be included in those considerations."" Scott Breen, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, said his organisation was pushing the administration to include an exemption from tariffs for tin plate steel - the metal used for food cans - as part of a farmer relief package, warning that otherwise costs of cans will jump, with ripple effects for farmers. ""One of the best, most direct ways to help them is to give this targeted relief,"" he said. But outside of promising a relief package for farmers, and agreeing to exempt big companies promising investments in the US from tariffs, the Trump administration has shown little concern about the risks of its approach to trade. Asked by NBC News in May about the possibility of relief for small businesses Trump said: ""They're not going to need it."" And in recent weeks, he has continued to expand the measures, despite polls indicating relatively limited public support. During Trump's first term, China and other trade partners explicitly targeted exports from farmers in an effort to raise political pressure on the president. But subsequent academic analyses found mixed evidence for the strategy. While some researchers linked China's moves to losses by Republicans in the 2018 midterms, others found that bailout payments appeared to help shore up support in farming areas. Brad Smith, a crop farmer in northwest Illinois, said he welcomed the prospect of relief, after China stopped buying US soybeans in May. That demand drop led to the price of soybeans sinking to around $10 per bushel, not enough for farmers to break even. Instead of selling at a loss, Mr Smith is filling his grain storage bins, in the hopes of better prices come spring. ""If you're swimming in red ink, an infusion of cash helps stem the tide,"" he said of the bailout. How much will the farmer bailout help? Chris Barrett, an economics professor at Cornell University, said farmers had been ""clobbered"" by the shifts in trade this year. But he said he still expected the decision to grant farmers relief to stoke debate, given the agricultural community's overwhelming political support for Trump and other demands on government funds. He also noted that US farmers, overall, are no longer poorer than the non-farm population. And during Trump's first term, research showed that the $28bn bailout in payments for farmers flowed disproportionately to the biggest farms. ""Should we be bailing out those who voted for this, especially if they're already better off than the average American, and if the bailout funds will be concentrated among the wealthiest of this group?"" Prof Barrett asked. Mark Legan Mark Legan, a livestock, corn and soybean farmer in Indiana, says a government bailout to farmers would be a ""band-aid"" solution Megan Wyatt is the owner of a toy shop in Granite Bay, California, which gets roughly 80% of its products from China. The tariffs mean her costs are 10-15% higher on average this year. She has not raised prices to fully offset the new expenses, making her concerned about her ability to retain her six employees. ""I'm not upset that other people are getting bailed out,"" she said. ""I just wish that none of us were in this situation, and I think that we could very easily not be."" Even in farm country, the bailout is seen as a mixed bag. Mark Legan, a livestock corn and soybean farmer in Putnam County, Indiana, called the expected government money a ""band-aid"" that would not address falling crop prices and rising costs for equipment, land and labour. ""I'm not going to fall on the sword and not take the government money,"" he said. ""But it's not going to solve the problem.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rvy3z3rllo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9199/live/ba9de8c0-a089-11f0-b184-97e3939592ff.jpg,2025-10-07T15:08:00.853000+00:00,bde50ddecc41d4aad93325021121bfaaeecefdbf
97bddd0ae5ae,Payouts of £700 per driver after car finance scandal,,"Payouts of £700 per driver after car finance scandal Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images Millions of victims of car finance mis-selling could receive less compensation than previously estimated, under plans from the regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said payouts could result from 14 million motor finance agreements between April 2007 and November 2024. The regulator previously suggested motorists could receive less than £950 per deal, but it now says the average will be about £700. Lenders could pay out £8.2bn in compensation. The payouts are over commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information given to car buyers. ""It's time their customers get fair compensation,"" Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said. ""We recognise that there will be a wide range of views on the scheme, its scope, timeframe and how compensation is calculated. On such a complex issue, not everyone will get everything they would like."" The scheme would be free to access for consumers. A ruling at the Supreme Court in August limited the breadth of these cases. Unfair deals The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements. About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle. In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) and meant drivers were at risk of overpaying for the loan. Other car buyers had an unfair contract because the commission paid to the dealer was so high, and some were not given accurate information about getting the best finance deal. The regulator has now proposed a scheme to compensate drivers who were subject to these arrangements. If it gets the go-ahead, once the scheme starts: lenders will contact those who have already complained. If they don't hear back after one month, lenders will assume they should look at the case and pay compensation if appropriate those who have already complained before the scheme gets up and running are likely to receive compensation faster those who have not complained will be contacted by their lender within six months of the scheme starting. People will be asked if they want to opt in to the scheme to have their case reviewed. They will have six months to decide those motor finance borrowers who do not receive a letter, for example because lenders no longer have their details and cannot trace them, will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim The regulator admitted that consumers can choose not to take part in the FCA's compensation scheme and instead go to court, where they may get more or less compensation, based on the facts of their case.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlzwqv7xz1o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c2d3/live/809ee9a0-a398-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-07T16:24:30.723000+00:00,ad72cad95d834d0a09a38f67db94fae76cc88f62
db6367578e5f,EU steel tariff hike threatens 'biggest ever crisis' for UK industry,,"The EU has announced plans to hike tariffs on imported steel in a move the UK's steel industry has said could be ""perhaps the biggest crisis"" it has ever faced. The commission has set out plans to cut the amount of steel that can be imported into the bloc by half - beyond which the new 50% tariffs will apply. The EU is the UK's most important export destination for steel, worth nearly £3bn and representing 78% of steel products made in the UK for overseas markets. The commission has come under pressure from some member states and their steel industries, which have been struggling to compete with cheap imports from countries like China and Turkey. The EU is proposing to reduce tariff-free quotas for imports to 18.3 million tonnes a year – a 47% reduction from 2024 levels. The new measures will come into force early next year, but will first need to be approved by the majority of EU member states and the European Parliament. ""We have global over capacity, unfair competition, state aid, and undercutting in prices and we are reacting to that"", Stéphane Séjourné, the European Commission's executive vice president for prosperity and industrial strategy. ""Eighteen thousand jobs were lost in the steel sector in 2024. That's too many, and we had to put a stop to that"", he told a news conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The announcement is another blow to the UK steel industry, after a proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US was put on hold indefinitely in September . Several firms were already in dire financial straits. The government took control of Chinese-owned plants in Scunthorpe earlier this year, while Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge collapsed into government control last month. Speaking on his way to India on Tuesday, the prime minister said there would be ""strong support""  from the government for the British steel industry, which could be severely impacted by EU tariffs. ""I'll be able to tell you more in due course, but we are in discussions as you'd expect"", Sir Keir Starmer said, refusing to go into the details of any discussion, including whether the UK was seeking exemptions from the rules. Responding to the announcement, the director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the government ""must go all out to leverage our trading relationship with the European Union to secure UK country quotas or potentially face disaster"". The move by the European Union is partly a response to US President Donald Trump, who sharply raised tariffs on foreign steel earlier this year, citing concern about China and has pushed other countries to take similar steps. Canada, Mexico and Brazil have also moved to increase protections for domestic steelmakers, responding to concerns about those firms losing business in the US while facing increased competition at home from shipments shifting from America. Mr Stace cautioned now against the EU's measures ""redirecting millions of tonnes of steel towards the UK"", something which could be ""terminal for many of our remaining steel companies"". The Community Union, representing UK steelworkers, called the measures an ""existential threat"" to the industry. Asked about UK concerns, European trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a press conference that he expected to ""fully engage"" with the UK on this issue, suggesting that a specific UK quota might be negotiated in the future. In a statement, the Department for Business said it was ""pushing the European Commission for urgent clarification of the impact of this move on the UK"". ""It's vital we protect trade flows between the UK and EU and we will work with our closest allies to address global challenges rather than adding to our industries' woes"", Industry Minister Chris McDonald said. ""This government has shown its commitment to our steel industry by securing preferential access to the US market for our exporters, and we continue to explore stronger trade measures to protect UK steel producers from unfair behaviours."" The government said the industry minister will meet steel representatives on Thursday to discuss their concerns.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy875px79po,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6663/live/eca51250-a38e-11f0-96cf-a52f331e209a.jpg,2025-10-07T17:09:40.230000+00:00,31a2f11cc83b13336fd17d480c15797c71e38718
e3c0484602c6,Car loan scandal payouts row - what's it about?,,"Car loan scandal payouts row - what's it about? Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images A compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling has been proposed by the financial regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says payouts could result from 14 million motor finance agreements between April 2007 and November 2024, an estimated 44% of the total during that period. While huge, an earlier Supreme Court ruling reduced the scope of those entitled to compensation when it sided with finance companies in two out of three crucial test cases focusing on commission payments made by banks and other credit providers to car dealers. What's the scandal about? The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements. About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle. In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) and were often undisclosed to consumers. The FCA said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much. Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals since 2007. Other car buyers had an unfair contract because the commission paid to the dealer was so high, accounting for at least 35% of the total cost of credit and 10% of the loan, and some were not given accurate information about getting the best finance deal because of an exclusive rights given to certain lenders. How much could victims receive, and when? Under the proposals, the FCA expects average payouts of £700 per mis-sold agreement. This is lower than the previous estimate from the regulator, when it said less than £950 per deal would be paid. It also means the total estimated cost of the redress will be at the lowest end of its estimate, at about £8.2bn. It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the degree of harm suffered by the consumer. Complaints have already been made in relation to four million agreements and those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company. Under its plans: lenders will contact those who have already complained. If they don't hear back after one month, lenders will assume they should look at the case and pay compensation if appropriate those who have already complained before the scheme gets up and running are likely to receive compensation faster those who have not complained will be contacted by their lender within six months of the scheme starting. People will be asked if they want to opt in to the scheme to have their case reviewed. They will have six months to decide those motor finance borrowers who do not receive a letter, for example because lenders no longer have their details and cannot trace them, will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim The FCA wants the new scheme to be up and running by early next year, with quick payouts made after that. However, for some - especially if contact details have changed - it could be many months for compensation to be paid. Who would foot the bill? The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs. Lenders - including some of the UK's biggest banks and specialist motor finance firms - have set aside more than £2bn for potential payouts already. Lloyds Bank has put aside £1.15bn, and Santander has allocated £295m. Financing companies have also set aside millions, including Close Brothers (£165m), Northridge Finance (£143m) and MotoNovo (through the bank FirstRand, £140m). Some of that money has been earmarked to cover legal and administrative costs. They can still have their say on the FCA's planned redress scheme. What did the Supreme Court decide? The Supreme Court considered three test cases. The cases focused on whether commission payments made by finance companies to dealers, of which the car buyers were unaware, amounted to bribery - and whether the car dealers themselves had a duty to act on behalf of their customers, rather than in their own interests. If it had been upheld, this could have paved the way for millions to claim compensation, but the court ruled against two of the test cases, siding with finance companies. This has narrowed the scope of people who will be able to claim compensation. What was the case that succeeded in the Supreme Court? Marcus Johnson The test case involved Marcus Johnson, 34, who bought a Suzuki Swift The Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings in three test cases which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful. The one test case which was upheld was that of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017. He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back. ""I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,"" he told the BBC . He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" to find out so much extra money had been taken. Mr Johnson said he was ""pleased for myself"" that his case was won, ""but not for the hundreds of others"" who will miss out. ""It's a win, but it's a really big bag of salt to go with it."" In his case, the Supreme Court said the terms of his finance deal were unfair due of the size of the commission payment, and the fact he was appeared to have been misled over the relationship between the finance firm and the dealer.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l9vvj097lo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12e5/live/a619af80-a1d2-11ef-bb35-5d21e680a10f.jpg,2025-10-07T19:11:36.524000+00:00,586203073d1402d2496e7dba878f205ec5800673

de2dd971efca,Tesla shares fall as new lower-cost cars disappoint,,"Tesla has unveiled cheaper models of two of its most popular cars in the US as it tries to boost sales on the heels of the expiration of a key US tax credit. But the carmaker's shares tumbled about 4% as investors were underwhelmed by the announcement. In the US, the new versions of its Model Y mid-sized sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan are priced only $5,000 less than previous versions. Tesla, which faces growing competition, has lost ground as it has been slow to offer new, more affordable vehicles, despite its release of a new Model Y version this year. Boss Elon Musk had previously promised a cheaper car but abandoned those plans last year to focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Despite his emphasis on artificial intelligence ventures, Tesla still relies heavily on its core car business, which has been under pressure on multiple fronts. It faces cuts to US government support for electric cars, competition from Chinese carmakers and consumer backlash earlier this year against Musk's involvement in the Trump administration. In July, the carmaker reported that its sales fell by 12% in the second quarter to $22.4bn - the biggest drop in at least a decade - after deliveries plunged 14%. Last week, Tesla was among the car companies to report record sales of electric cars over the past three months. But analysts said the boom was caused by a dash to buy before the end of a government subsidy. Tesla vehicle prices for US consumers increased by as much as $7,500 (£5,588) this month after a US tax credit for electric vehicles expired at the end of September. Tesla executives have acknowledged that the end of the tax credit for buyers of electric cars in the US is likely to hurt the business. The newly released lower-cost models, aimed in part at offsetting the loss of the EV credit, will lack certain features found in other Tesla vehicles. In the US, the lower-cost, stripped-down versions of its Model Y and Model 3 will be priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively, according to Tesla's website. They did not immediately appear on the UK version of Tesla's website.

745183efac6e,Vape boss says allowing 'strict' ads would help smokers quit,,"Vape boss says allowing 'strict' ads would help smokers quit Will Bain Business presenter and Pritti Mistry Business reporter BAT Allowing more vape adverts could encourage smokers to switch, says the boss of one of the world's largest tobacco and vaping manufacturers. Asli Ertonguc is managing director of the UK and Irish operations of British American Tobacco (BAT), a 123-year-old company that counts Rothmans, Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes among its notable brands. Traditional cigarette sales are shrinking as smokers increasingly switch to vapes and nicotine pouches which are perceived as less harmful, but the UK has tough restrictions on advertising these because the government considers all tobacco products to be harmful to health. Ertonguc believes allowing a ""very strict marketing framework"" targeted only to adults could make smokers aware of alternatives and encourage them to switch. We addressed her comments to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). But the government department is yet to respond, while ASA declined to comment. Dressed in a caramel-coloured suit, Ertonguc is composed as she settles in to the studio for the Big Boss Interview, a new business podcast from the BBC. The 51-year-old single mother who has more than 20 years at BAT has seen the industry and the business transform. Vaping and nicotine pouches have surged to make up nearly 70% of the company's UK revenue in the last five years. ""Smokers are changing fast, and so are we,"" she says. ""Vapers deserve to know what is in their vapes so that they can use them safely, they can trust what they're using, and also helps smokers to quit."" While cigarettes contain a range of toxic cancer-causing chemicals, vaping may itself cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. Therefore, it is only recommended for adult smokers trying to quit as part of the NHS ""swap to stop"" programme. According to the NHS, vaping is less harmful than smoking and could help people to quit. However, the long-term effects are not yet known, and children have been warned against using vapes. Challenged over vaping being bad for people's health, Ertonguc cites studies from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European organisations. ""Nicotine is not the cause of cancer, but it is addictive. It's not risk free,"" she says. About 20% of 11 to 17-year-olds in the UK have tried vaping, according to a 2025 survey by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), and 7% of that age group said they currently vaped. And globally the figures are even more stark with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning at least 15 million children are using e-cigarettes , which is fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction. Ertonguc admits that seeing children vaping makes her uneasy. ""Smoking is not a thing for youth,"" she says. ""Any nicotine product shouldn't be used by anyone under legal age."" BBC/BAT In 2019, BAT came under fire for using social media influencers to promote nicotine products to youngsters. The ASA banned BAT, along with three other vaping companies, from promoting its products on Instagram. At the time BAT said its ads aimed to give factual information but ""stopped short of direct or indirect promotion"". Ertonguc says BAT no longer uses influencers to market its products. ""And where we have existence in social media, we have also clear guidance that the audience has to be more than 80% adults,"" she says. Ertonguc says BAT has deliberately focused on closed, rechargeable vaping systems rather than disposable vapes, which flooded the market before being banned in June for environmental and safety reasons. ""These disposable products also changed the entire vaping industry in the UK,"" says Ertonguc. ""One, it opened up more smokers to switch. That was the positive part. But equally, we can say the existence of disposable made the [vaping] category lose some credibility."" Ertonguc is advocating for retail licensing, mandatory age checks, pre-market product testing and clearer health warnings to reflect the risk profile of vaping compared to smoking, and tougher penalties for those who break the rules. Smoke free ambition The goal is to prevent illegal products from undermining public health efforts and to support and educate smokers in making informed choices, she says. Ertonguc expects this approach to have a far bigger impact on reducing smoking than the government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill , currently weaving its way through parliament with the aim of creating a smoke-free generation. Its ultimate aim is to make it impossible for today's 15-year-olds and younger to ever legally buy tobacco products. There would also be a ban on vapes and nicotine products from being deliberately branded, promoted and advertised to children. ""Implementation will be the biggest challenge,"" she says. ""Today, when we look at the fines, they are not very discouraging."" Vapes will help the UK's ambition to reach smoke-free status by 2030, she says. ""I don't believe it is not achievable,"" she says.

e29a283ea83a,"Gold tops record $4,000 an ounce as uncertainty fuels rally",,"The price of gold has hit a record high of more than $4,000 (£2,985) an ounce as investors look for safe places to put their money over concerns about economic and political uncertainty around the world. Gold has seen its biggest rally since the 1970s, rising by more than 25% since April when US President Donald Trump announced tariffs which have upset global trade. Analysts say another issue worrying investors is delays to the release of important economic data due to the US government shutdown , as it is set to enter its second week. Gold is seen as a so-called safe haven investment, which is expected to retain or increase its value in times of market turbulence or economic downturns. The price of spot gold - the amount you receive if you sell the precious metal over the counter - rose above $4,011 an ounce on Wednesday morning in Asia. Gold futures - which serve as a gauge of market sentiment - reached the same level on 7 October. Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future. The US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a ""tailwind for gold prices"", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist. Investors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns. It rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House. But gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong. Gold's ""unprecedented rally"" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How. He added that the rise is also tied to the weakening US dollar and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold. Gregor Gregerson, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year. Retail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said. ""Most of our clients are long-term holders,"" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years. ""Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for a least five years,"" he said. As Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices fall as well as rise. Its price may dip if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong. In April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said. ""Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound."" And in 2022, gold's value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation which was triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr Heng. A key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added. The recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong. Meanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The president's targeting of the Fed can ""undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,"" said Mr Wong. In such an environment, gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty ""gains renewed importance,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ex3wgjlexo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bf57/live/95f02230-a3eb-11f0-90de-cfdf69951f7c.jpg,2025-10-08T02:59:25.907000+00:00,74db611bedf079d73132dc55566982707d8e03f8
9d571e4f8147,World's first resort hospital opens in gambling hub Macau,,"Macau, which overtook Las Vegas almost 20 years ago as the world's biggest gambling hub, is now trying to become a major centre for healthcare tourism. On Monday, the special administrative region of China saw the opening of the first ever resort hospital to provide health screening, advanced scans and cosmetic procedures, as part of its luxury medical services. The facility is located in Macau's Studio City, a Hollywood-themed casino and entertainment resort owned by Hong Kong-based Melco Resorts and Entertainment. The project aims to promote medical tourism in Macau, create jobs and bring healthcare and leisure under one roof, said the resort chain's chief executive Lawrence Ho. The facility was opened in partnership with iRad Hospital, a private healthcare group in Hong Kong that specialises in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. The ""revolutionary"" concept aims to attract regional and foreign visitors, encouraging longer stays and higher spending in the resort and the city, said Melco Resorts in a statement. Macau, which attracts almost 40 million visitors a year, offers an ""unparalleled opportunity"" to become a leading destination for medical tourism, said iRad's honorary chairman, Dennis Tam. The hospital project fits with Macau's diversification plan, said Mr Ho.

50773a45722c,America's top banker sounds warning on US stock market fall,,"America's top banker sounds warning on US stock market fall Simon Jack Business editor and Michael Sheils McNamee Watch: 'I'm more worried than others about stock market fall', says JP Morgan boss There is a higher risk of a serious fall in US stocks than is currently being reflected in the market, the head of JP Morgan has told the BBC. Jamie Dimon, who leads America's largest bank, said he was ""far more worried than others"" about a serious market correction, which he said could come in the next six months to two years. In a rare and wide-ranging interview, the bank boss also said that the US had become a ""less reliable"" partner on the world stage. He cautioned he was still ""a little worried"" about inflation in the US, but insisted he thought the Federal Reserve would remain independent, despite repeated attacks by the Trump administration on its chair Jerome Powell. Jamie Dimon was in Bournemouth, where he was announcing an investment of about £350m in JP Morgan's campus there, as well as a £3.5m philanthropic investment in local non-profits. Commenting on the investment, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""As one of Dorset's biggest private sector employers, JP Morgan Chase expanding their Bournemouth campus is fantastic news for the local economy and people who live here."" Ahead of the interview, Dimon appeared before a town hall on the campus - cutting a figure more akin to an off-duty rock star than bank CEO - wearing an open-collar shirt and jeans, and high-fiving staff on his way to the stage. Opening with his take on the UK's economy, Dimon said he felt Rachel Reeves was doing a ""terrific job"", and he felt optimistic about some of the government's attempts to boost innovation and cut regulation. However, in the broader economic picture, he felt there were increased risks US stock markets were overheated. ""I am far more worried about that than others,"" he said. There were a ""lot of things out there"" creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, he added, pointing to risk factors like the geopolitical environment, fiscal spending and the remilitarisation of the world. ""All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,"" he said. ""So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal."" Much of the rapid growth in the stock market in recent years has been driven by investment in AI. On Wednesday, the Bank of England drew a comparison with the dot com boom (and subsequent bust) of the late 1990s - and warned that the value of AI tech companies ""appear stretched"" with a rising risk of a ""sharp correction"". ""The way I look at it is AI is real, AI in total will pay off,"" he said. ""Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off, but most people involved in them didn't do well."" He added some of the money being invested in AI would ""probably be lost"". Bullets, guns and bombs Global security has been a recent focus for the JP Morgan boss, with his letter to shareholders earlier this year warning the US would run out of missiles in seven days of a South China Sea war. Reflecting on how the world could combat risk factors, he pointed to greater military investment. ""People talk about stockpiling things like crypto, I always say we should be stockpiling bullets, guns and bombs. ""The world's a much more dangerous place, and I'd rather have safety than not."" Another risk factor which many in the global economy believe the US could be facing is pressure placed on the independence of the Federal Reserve, America's central bank. On this, he said he thought central bank independence was important - but was willing to take Trump ""at his word"" that he would not interfere in Fed independence, despite the president describing current Fed chair Jerome Powell as a ""moron"" and a ""numbskull"" for failing to lower interest rates more quickly. Dimon acknowledged the US had become a ""little less reliable"" but said that some of the Trump administration's action had pushed Europe to act over underinvestment in Nato and its lack of economic competitiveness. Dimon also shared insights into a potential breakthrough in trade negotiations between India and the US. He said he wanted to ""bring India closer"" and he believed a deal was close to reduce additional tariffs on India, which were imposed as a penalty for its continued trade with Russia, particularly its oil purchases. ""In fact, I've spoken to several of the Trump officials who say they want to do that, and I've been told that they are going to do that."" Jamie Dimon's name has been frequently mentioned among the big financial players capable of making a transition into politics. Ahead of Trump's re-election last year, influential investor Bill Ackman said he would be an ""incredible choice"" as treasury secretary, and he has also been the subject of speculation about a potential presidential run. Asked about his political ambitions, Dimon said it ""wasn't on the cards"", and his focus was on keeping JP Morgan as a ""healthy and vibrant company"". ""If you gave me the presidency, I'd take it,"" he joked. ""I think I'd do a good job.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7591/live/afd84100-a48b-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-08T23:02:24.018000+00:00,0a7ed739acff84ca5bdfbacfc8023a879eabdba4

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo Elon Musk has agreed to settle a $128m (£100m) lawsuit brought by four former top executives at Twitter, now X, over unpaid severance when he took over the company. The executives, who include former chief Parag Agrawal, argued that Mr Musk fired them ""without reason"" after he bought Twitter in 2022 and denied them severance payments. ""The parties have reached a settlement and the settlement requires certain conditions to be met in the near term,"" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing last week. They did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The suit, filed last year, is one of several legal challenges over unpaid severance for workers who were laid off after Musk took over. Lawyers for the former Twitter executives, and for Mr Musk and X, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the settlement. The former top brass - Mr Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, former chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde and former general counsel Sean Edgett - contended in their lawsuit that they are owed one year's salary and stock awards, under a years-old severance plan. They also said Musk's move was part of a pattern of refusing to pay former staff what they were due. In August, Mr Musk and X agreed to settle a separate lawsuit filed by roughly 6,000 former rank-and-file Twitter employees who argued they were owed  $500m in severance pay. Mr Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44bn, after initially trying to back out of his offer. After the acquisition closed, he immediately moved to fire top leaders at the company, including the four executives. Mr Musk slashed Twitter's workforce by more than half. In their lawsuit, the former top officials contend that Mr Musk was frustrated about being forced to complete the purchase and that the billionaire falsely accused them of misconduct to push them out.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce326pyzlr4o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8bfd/live/a2102540-a488-11f0-961e-13040d1e97f4.jpg,2025-10-08T21:02:04.604000+00:00,b14c34cf0faf456c813c0d0bf5d665d80d012f33
907b0180cfb4,ChatGPT image snares suspect in deadly Pacific Palisades fire,,"ChatGPT image snares suspect in deadly Pacific Palisades fire Ana Faguy and Nardine Saad BBC News, Los Angeles Watch: Palisades Fire spews 'fire devil' A 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of starting the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles that killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,000 homes in January. Evidence collected from Jonathan Rinderknecht's digital devices included an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city, justice department officials said. One of the most destructive blazes in LA history, the fire erupted on 7 January near a hiking trail that overlooked the wealthy coastal neighbourhood. The Eaton Fire, ignited the same day in the LA area, killed another 19 people and razed 9,400 structures. The cause of that fire remains unclear. The Palisades fire scorched more than 23,000 acres (9,308 hectares) and caused about $150bn (£112bn) in damage. Wiping out whole neighbourhoods, the conflagration raged for more than three weeks, also ravaging parts of Topanga and Malibu. Among the thousands of structures destroyed in the fires were the homes of a number of celebrities, including Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton and Jeff Bridges. Watch: Palisades fire suspect created ChatGPT image of a city burning Mr Rinderknecht was arrested in Florida on Tuesday and has been charged with destruction of property by means of fire, Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli told a news conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles. ""The arrest, we hope, will offer a measure of justice to all those impacted,"" Mr Essayli said. Officials said further charges - including murder - could follow. Mr Rinderknecht appeared in court in Florida on Wednesday. He did not enter a plea. He is scheduled to return to the US District Court in Orlando on Thursday for a bond hearing. He is not expected to enter an official plea until his arraignment hearing in Los Angeles in the coming weeks. Mr Rinderknecht had been living and working in California, and moved to Florida shortly after the fire, according to authorities. Justice department The initial blaze Mr Rinderknecht allegedly started on New Year's Day was called the Lachman fire. Although it was quickly suppressed by firefighters, it continued to smoulder underground in the root structure of dense vegetation, according to investigators, before it flared up again above ground in a windstorm. The suspect was familiar with the area because he was a former resident of Pacific Palisades, officials said. He had lived one block away from the Skull Rock Trailhead,  where he allegedly started the fire. He lit it with an open flame after he completed a ride as an Uber driver on New Year's Eve, according to the indictment. Two passengers rode with Mr Rinderknecht earlier on New Year's Eve. One passenger told investigators he remembered the driver had appeared agitated and angry. Officials said they had used his phone data to pinpoint his location when the fire initially started on 1 January, but when they pressed him on details he allegedly lied to investigators, claiming he was near the bottom of the trail. Uber said Mr Rinderknecht wasn't on the popular ride-sharing app at the time of the fire, but the company worked closely with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help determine his whereabouts using GPS data and other relevant information. The company also said it removed Mr Rinderknecht's access to its platform as soon as it learned of his suspected involvement in the fire, but it noted he passed his initial background check in 2023 and annual check-ins thereafter. Justice Department Authorities said they also found other links between Mr Rinderknecht and the fire on his phone, including videos that Mr Rinderknecht had taken of firefighters trying to put out the flames. The phone also showed that he repeatedly called 911 just after midnight on New Year's day, but could not get through because of patchy mobile reception on the trailhead. There was a screen recording of him trying to call emergency services and at one point being connected with a dispatcher. Mr Rinderknecht also asked ChatGPT: ""Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?"" Investigators said the suspect wanted to ""preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire"". ""He wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire,"" the indictment said. Investigators noted that Mr Rinderknecht appeared nervous during their interview with him on 24 January this year, and his carotid artery would pulsate whenever he was asked who had started the fire. In July 2024, five months before he allegedly set the fire, Mr Rinderknecht asked ChatGPT to create an image of a ""dystopian painting"" that included a burning forest and a crowd of people running away from a fire, according to investigators. His prompt to the AI tool included the text: ""In the middle [of the painting], hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it. ""On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people. ""They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle. They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing."" A month before allegedly setting the fire, Mr Rinderknecht allegedly inputted a prompt to ChatGPT that included the text: ""I literally burnt the Bible that I had. It felt amazing. I felt so liberated."" An outside review into the fire that was commissioned by Los Angeles County supervisors found that ""outdated policies"" for sending emergency alerts had delayed evacuation warnings, among other official failings. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the arrest an important step toward ""bringing closure to the thousands of Californians whose lives were upended"". He added that the state was supporting the federal investigation into the fire. Hours after Mr Rinderknecht's arrest, the Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) released its long-awaited After-Action Review Report (AARR) on the Palisades Fire, which detailed the first 36 hours of the department's response. The report - meant to identify lessons learned from the response and to enhance preparedness and response for future wildfires - found firefighters did not have enough resources for the red flag weather conditions and hurricane-force winds that fuelled the fire. LAFD listed nearly 100 challenges that firefighters faced during the Palisades fire,  which burned for 25 days and forced many fire responders to work for 36 to 48 hours straight. ""Responders were faced with the inevitable consequences of a perfect storm: dry vegetation, unrelenting and unusual wind activity, significant ember cast, a landscape packed with combustible vegetation, large vulnerable structures, a diminishing water supply, and a loss of aerial suppression support,"" the report said. Additionally, firefighters were unable to secure the origin of the fire, faced issues recalling off-duty firefighters to respond and blamed fire chiefs with little  experience for handling a blaze of that magnitude. Delays in communicating evacuation orders and issues with arranging effective evacuations and traffic also created problems. LAFD Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva, who replaced sacked fire chief Kristin Crowley , said that he hoped the report ""strengthens public confidence in the Los Angeles Fire Department's readiness to respond to any future wildfires"". The department, he said, has since implemented several new processes to protect the city, including upgrading communications technology. Newsom's office has also requested a review by the nation's leading fire safety researchers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8exz5yg14ko,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d6e/live/0e430540-a469-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-09T02:57:16.921000+00:00,ecbebd667a63183c981e47651f4f28753e5eadd4
f8e15c5754e7,China tightens export rules for crucial rare earths,,"China tightens export rules for crucial rare earths Peter Hoskins Business reporter Bloomberg via Getty Images Neodymium is used to make the strong magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, electric car motors and jet engines China has tightened its rules on the export of rare earths -  the elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products. New regulations announced by the country's Ministry of Commerce ""to safeguard national security"" formalise existing rules on processing technology and unauthorised overseas cooperation. China is also likely to block exports to foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms. Rare earth exports are a key sticking point in the months-long negotiations between Beijing and Washington over trade and tariffs. The announcement comes as China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump are expected to meet later this month. Technology used to mine and process rare earths, or to make magnets from rare earths, can only be exported with permission from the government, the Ministry of Commerce said. Many of these technologies are already restricted. China had added several rare earths and related material to its export control list in April, which caused a major shortage back then. But the new announcement makes clear that licenses are unlikely to be issued to arms manufacturers and certain companies in the chip industry. Chinese firms are also banned from working with foreign companies on rare earths without government permission. China has been accused by the US and other Western countries of aiding Russia's war on Ukraine by allowing dual technology exports - materials that can be used for either civilian or military purposes - to be sent to Moscow. Beijing has repeatedly denied this. The latest announcement also clarifies the specific technologies and processes that are restricted. These include mining, smelting and separation, magnetic material manufacturing, and recycling rare earths from other resources. The assembly, debugging, maintenance, repair, and upgrading of production equipment are also prohibited from export without permission, the announcement added. This could have an impact on the US, which has a significant rare earths mining industry but lacks processing facilities. What are rare earths? Rare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products. Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as ""rare"" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract. Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in. For instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, electric car motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient. China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.

People can provide ID photos to verify their age on Discord - a networking hub for players to chat and share files with others in the gaming community. The leaked data may involve personal information, partial credit card details and messages that were exchanged with Discord's customer service agents, the San-Francisco-based company says . No full credit card details, passwords, or messages and activity beyond conversations with Discord's customer support agents were leaked, the firm said. All impacted users have been contacted and Discord is working with law enforcement to investigate the matter, it added. The platform said it has revoked the customer support provider's access to the system that was targeted in the breach. Discord did not name the third-party company involved. A representative from Zendesk, a customer service software provider for Discord, told the BBC that its systems had not been compromised and that the breach did was not caused by a vulnerability within its platform. Some online commentators have claimed that the data breach was bigger than Discord has revealed. A spokesperson for Discord told the BBC that those claims are inaccurate and ""part of an attempt to extort payment"". ""We will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions,"" the spokesperson added.

The plans could make it easier for venues to serve food outside and host more live music, in a bid to ""remove unnecessary barriers"". Pub landlords and local communities will be able to have their say in a four-week call for evidence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the review was about ""cutting red tape"" and ""boosting footfall"" to support the UK's economic growth. But critics have warned relaxing rules around alcohol would lead to more antisocial behaviour. Sir Keir said ""pubs and bars are the beating heart of our communities"", and added that the government was ""backing them to thrive"". ""When our locals do well, our economy does too,"" he said. The call for evidence will focus on nine key recommendations from the Government's Licensing Taskforce, with particular emphasis on streamlining on-trade alcohol licensing for hospitality venues. It said it plans to cut the cost of licensing , extend business rates relief and cut alcohol duty on draught pints. Nick Mackenzie, co-chair of the Licensing Taskforce and chief executive at pub giant Greene King, said updating the licensing system was a ""vital step"" towards reducing the challenges of running a hospitality business. ""Pubs are faced with continued rising costs, placing them under enormous pressures which is why the Government must continue to back the sector, including critical reforms on business rates which would unlock opportunities for pubs to invest and help drive economic growth,"" he said. Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK told the Guardian the proposed reforms would be a ""charter for chaos"" without support from local authorities and health experts. He said permitting vendors to sell alcohol later into the evening would ""inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l830m55dno,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff79/live/414ddfd0-a4d4-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-09T06:53:42.016000+00:00,ed146e217e05fb7832685f975f104537028476d8

9d94af385a6e,All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time,,"All Post Office Horizon victims entitled to free legal advice for first time Emma Simpson Business correspondent and Emer Moreau Business reporter PA Media All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal seeking compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice, the government has announced. The change could potentially have a major effect on the size of the payouts some victims are able to achieve. It is one of a number of improvements to the compensation schemes available to victims, made in response to the first report from the public inquiry into the scandal, widely described as one of the UK's worst ever miscarriages of justice. In July, the chair of the inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, delivered his findings into the human impact of the scandal and called for urgent action . The government said it has accepted all but one of the recommendations relating specifically to Horizon. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon computer system made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts. Hundreds of others poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution. Making the announcement, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said there was ""clearly more to do to bring justice to those affected"" and accepting the recommendations was a ""crucial step"" towards doing this. There are four compensation schemes for victims in various circumstances, but they have been criticised for being too slow and complicated and for only paying out fractions of the claims made. Changes announced by the government on Thursday mean that victims who have sought compensation through the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) - which accounts for more than half of the compensation claims paid out so far - are now eligible for government-funded legal advice. This brings it in line with the three other schemes. The government has also committed to setting up a new appeals process for postmasters who accepted a fixed payout under the HSS scheme. Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal advice. Action taken in response to other recommendations included: the government extending the date for the closure of the HSS scheme giving greater clarity on the definition of ""full and fair redress"" starting work on a restorative justice project for postmasters So far, more than £1.2bn has been paid out to more than 9,000 claimants across all of the compensation schemes. Reacting, a spokesperson for Fujitsu - who provided the Horizon IT system - said the company had ""apologised for, and deeply regret, our role in sub-postmasters' suffering"". 'Battling all the time' Tony Downey Tony Downey and his wife Caroline were victims of the Post Office scandal Tony Downey bought the Hawkshead Post Office in the Lake District in 2001. He and his wife Caroline were forced to put in £35,000 of their own savings to make up for ""losses"" created by the faulty software. He lost his home, his livelihood and went bankrupt as a result. His health has also suffered. Mr Downey is still waiting for full compensation nearly three years after submitting his claim.

3dc82d219481,Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market,,"Five ways abolishing stamp duty could change the housing market Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images The debate around stamp duty is intensifying. When Kemi Badenoch said a future Conservative government would abolish it on the purchase of main homes, it went down well at the Tory Party conference . There has also been speculation that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering replacing it. Scrapping stamp duty would be popular among some home buyers, including first-time buyers. But, analysts say there would be some significant consequences of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences, affecting buyers, sellers and the wider UK economy. 1. House prices might rise Whenever there has been a temporary easing of stamp duty, such as in the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, house prices have then risen. It is more difficult to judge whether a permanent abolition would have the same long-term impact on prices as the short-term sweetener of a stamp duty holiday. However, greater demand is likely to feed through to asking prices. ""If, and this is a big if, it is a simple tax giveaway, the likelihood is that the current stamp duty bill simply passes through into prices,"" says Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. In turn, that could mean first-time buyers paying less in stamp duty, but having to find a bigger deposit. ""Given the way stamp duty works, this would be unevenly distributed across the country,"" Mr Cook added. The most obvious point here is that the government in Westminster can only control stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales have their own land and transaction taxes overseen by the devolved administrations. 2. Tax cut for the wealthy A swathe of first-time buyers do not pay stamp duty. That's because, in England and Northern Ireland, they are exempt when buying properties of up to £300,000 . ""For them, the enormous challenge is raising a deposit,"" says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. Data from property portal Rightmove suggests that 40% of homes for sale in England are stamp duty free for first-time buyers. While the vast majority of movers pay stamp duty, the rate increases at certain price thresholds . So, the bigger the home, the bigger the benefit, if stamp duty was scrapped. This will also mean a big regional difference in the impact of such a policy. At the moment, 76% of properties on sale in the North East of England are free of stamp duty for first-time buyers, according to Rightmove's figures. In London, it is only 11%. Richard Donnell, from Zoopla, points out that 60% of all stamp duty is paid in southern England - so the majority of the benefit of abolition would be felt in the south. 3. Easier to find somewhere to move to One of the great selling points of stamp duty abolition is the extra mobility it should provide for workers, buyers, sellers and downsizers, according to experts. ""Homeownership is the foundation of a fairer and more secure society - but stamp duty has denied that opportunity to too many for too long,"" says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance. ""Our research shows over 800,000 homeowners have shelved moving plans in the past two years, and stamp duty is a major barrier."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economic think tank, says the winners will be those who want to move frequently, to more or less expensive homes. It should, for example, clear an obstacle for older homeowners, who want to sell a family home but are discouraged by stamp duty. If they are more likely to move, then their homes become available to younger families and the whole market becomes more fluid. However, others suggest the influence of stamp duty could be overblown. ""Take someone downsizing, from a £750,000 property to a £300,000 one. In England and Northern Ireland, they'd pay £5,000 in stamp duty. It's a fraction of what they're likely to pay in estate agency fees, and sits along a huge range of costs from conveyancing to removals,"" Ms Coles from Hargreaves Lansdown says. ""It begs the question of whether removing the cost of the tax is a gamechanger."" 4. Potential tax rises elsewhere Stamp duty raises a lot of money for the Treasury, so scrapping it would leave a gap in the public finances. The IFS said that the direct cost of the Conservative policy might be around £10.5bn to £11bn in 2029-30, although the Tories' own estimate is about £9bn. The question for any administration tempted to scrap or reduce stamp duty is how else it finds the money. The Conservatives say they will make savings elsewhere. The other option is to raise other taxes. As some analysts have said, the main consideration is not what is scrapped, but what replaces it. 5. Bad news for renters The idea of scrapping stamp duty for primary residences could end up meaning less choice for renters. The IFS suggests it could discourage the purchase of rental properties by landlords, as they would still have to pay stamp duty. The think tank says it would increase the more favourable tax treatment of owner-occupation relative to renting.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9v7wppzm2ro,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e48c/live/cdb688c0-a4f5-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T14:36:03.640000+00:00,628426e97ee7ef7b1b86526c83fc901fe2890fe7
3ba32798032a,Tesla investigated over self-driving cars on wrong side of road,,"Tesla is being investigated by the US government after reports the firm's self-driving cars had broken traffic laws, including driving on the wrong side of the road and not stopping for red lights. It said it was aware of 58 reports where the electric cars had committed such violations, according to a filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). An estimated 2.9 million cars equipped with full self-driving tech will fall under the investigation. Tesla, whose boss Elon Musk recently became the world's first half-trillionaire , has been approached for comment. The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation will ""assess the scope, frequency, and potential safety consequences"" of the ""Full Self-Driving (Supervised)"" mode. In this mode - which costs extra for Tesla owners - the cars can make lane changes and turns, but drivers must always be alert to take over at any time. According to the NHTSA report, there were six crashes caused by cars stopping at a traffic light before setting off while the light was still red. Four of the crashes resulted in injuries. The traffic authority said Tesla had taken action ""to address the issue"" of cars going through red lights at a particular intersection in Maryland, where the problem repeatedly occurred. The agency will also investigate reports of vehicles going into the opposite lane when making a turn. It said some of the reported incidents gave ""little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene"". Tesla is already facing an investigation from the NHTSA over the cars' door locking mechanisms, after cases where children were reportedly trapped inside Model Y cars. In some instances, car owners chose to smash the windows to let them out. Tesla recently unveiled cheaper models of two of its most popular cars, as it tries to compete with cheaper electric vehicles often made by Chinese companies. Its boss Elon Musk was formerly a close ally of President Donald Trump before a public falling-out earlier in the year. In July, he announced the formation of a new political party, the America Party, in an attempt to rival the Republicans and Democrats.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg02rdxxz7o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba22/live/3faac210-a51f-11f0-9cda-fff576c5be6d.jpg,2025-10-09T15:41:56.857000+00:00,868ef1fac62a719825dbdf988b09865ef566e90f
8e9836f01eab,How will the EU's new border system work?,,"How will the EU's new border system work? Katy Austin Transport correspondent BBC People wait to go through departures at Eurostar's London St Pancras terminus The next time you travel from the UK to Europe, you might notice some changes. The EU's much-delayed new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System or EES, will be gradually introduced this autumn. The system is meant to strengthen security and ultimately make travel smoother, but there have been concerns there will be queues when people first register. What is EES and where is it being introduced? EES is a digital system designed to keep track of when non-EU citizens enter and leave the Schengen Area. This covers 29 European countries - mainly in the EU - which people can travel across without border controls. It includes many popular destinations for UK travellers, such as France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. Under the new system, fingerprints and a photo have to be registered. EES will eventually replace the current system of passports being stamped by a border officer. When will EES start? After being postponed several times, the European Commission confirmed in July that EES will begin on 12 October. It will be gradually phased in over six months. That means when you first encounter EES will depend where you're travelling to, and when. At Dover, ferry passengers in coaches will start using the new system on 12 October, followed by other tourist traffic on 1 November. At Eurostar terminals, only a small number of business travellers will be invited to use it from 12 October. More passengers will be directed to it over the coming months. Eurotunnel, which runs vehicle shuttles through the Channel Tunnel, will also introduce EES in stages from 12 October. Only Eurotunnel's coach passengers and freight will do the new checks to start with. They will be done by a border officer, so not much will change. Tourists in cars will start using automated kiosks by the end of the year. The company hasn't given an exact date. Different airports are likely to bring in EES at different times - it's a very mixed picture. But after a slow start, the number using it should gradually increase over the coming months. EES should be active at every Schengen border crossing point in all 29 participating countries by 10 April 2026. What will passengers have to do under EES? The first time they use the new system, people from most non-EU countries -  including the UK - will have to register biometric information while having their passport scanned. This may be done with a border officer, or at an automated machine, depending on where people travel to. Flight passengers will register when they arrive at their destination airport. But registration will be done as you leave the UK if you are crossing the English Channel by ferry from the port of Dover, taking the Eurotunnel shuttle to France, or getting the Eurostar train. At these places, most passengers will have to follow the instructions at special kiosks. The machines will scan each passport, then take fingerprints and a photo. Children under 12 won't have to provide fingerprints. Staff should be on hand to help. The screen will also present travellers with four questions about their trip, such as confirming where they will be staying and that they have enough money. However, at Eurotunnel, those questions will be asked by border officers, on a discretionary basis. The port of Dover has had to make big changes. It has reclaimed some land from the sea to create an additional processing area. People will head to this new area, a mile from the ferry terminal, to do their EES checks. Because the French border has in effect been moved to a coach processing building in this new area, coaches will be sealed after passengers have completed their checks. They will then drive over to catch their ferry. The port's boss says groups of schoolchildren will be able to do some of their registration in advance, so they will only need to present their passports at the border. Eurostar has already installed 49 EES processing machines at London St Pancras Eurostar has installed 49 EES kiosks in three areas around its London St Pancras terminal. Passengers will use them before presenting their ticket at the departures area. But it says all passports will continue to be stamped manually until EES is fully rolled out in 2026. Eurotunnel has installed more than a hundred kiosks at each side of the Channel. Customers who are travelling in cars will be directed to drive up to a kiosk bearing their registration number, and provide their biometric information there. Coach passengers will go through the process with a border officer. Eurotunnel has installed more than a hundred EES kiosks at each side of the English Channel A mobile phone app has been developed to enable passengers to do part of the process before reaching the border. However, this won't be widely used when EES is first introduced. The EES registration will be valid for three years, with the details verified on each trip during that period. What are the concerns about the introduction of EES? Concerns have repeatedly been raised that the extra couple of minutes it takes for each traveller to complete the registration process could lead to big queues, particularly at space-constrained Dover. However, bosses at cross-Channel travel hubs hope that the decision to introduce EES gradually, instead of with a ""big bang"" start, will reduce the risk of disruption. Eurotunnel chief executive Yann Leriche says there will be no ""chaos"" or queues at the Channel tunnel, insisting his company has done extensive modelling and is fully prepared. Similarly, Eurostar hopes its decision to limit EES initially to some business travellers before expanding its use will help prevent queues. What is ETIAS and when is that coming? The EU is also introducing a new visa waiver system linked to passports called the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which will build on the EES. Citizens of non-EU countries who don't need a visa to enter the EU - including people from the UK - will be able to apply online for authorisation before they travel. ETIAS isn't due to start until the end of 2026, but the final date has not yet been confirmed. It will cost €20 (£17.47) per application, and will be valid for three years.

3b93fe02d029,Sunak joins Microsoft and AI firm as paid adviser,,"Rishi Sunak has taken up paid adviser roles at tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. The former prime minister has been told he must not lobby ministers on behalf of the companies by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), an independent watchdog which oversees the activities of former government figures. Sunak - who remains the MP for Richmond and Northallerton - said he was ""delighted"" to be working ""with two of the world's leading tech firms"" and planned to donate his earnings to a charity he founded. During his premiership, Sunak made tech regulation a significant priority, setting up an AI safety summit in 2023 . In letters of advice sent to Sunak by Acoba and published on Thursday, his part-time role at Microsoft was described as providing ""high- level strategic perspectives"" on geopolitical trends. The watchdog said it had been informed by Sunak that his part-time advisory role at Anthropic - an AI firm seeking to compete with companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta - would be ""akin to operating as an internal think tank"". Acoba said Anthropic ""has a significant interest in UK government policy"", meaning that Sunak's appointment could potentially be seen to offer ""unfair access and influence"" within government. The appointment with Microsoft, a ""major investor"" in the UK, also presented similar issues, it wrote. However, it also said that his time spent out of government would have reduced the value of any information Sunak may still possess, while reiterating the standing rules ex-ministers have to abide when seeking employment after leaving government. Sunak was told not to advise on bidding for UK contracts, or to lobby the government for two years from his last day in ministerial office. In addition to the two tech roles, it was previously confirmed Sunak will act as a paid advisor to the bank Goldman Sachs , where he previously worked between 2001 and 2004. There had been speculation that Sunak, who was in No 10 between October 2022 and July 2024, would leave the Commons to take up a Silicon Valley role shortly after the election. He previously lived in California, where he still has a home, and held a US visa until 2021. But in his final prime minister's questions, Sunak vowed to spend more time in his constituency, which he called ""the greatest place on Earth"". ""If anyone needs me, I will be in Yorkshire,"" he said. All proceeds from the new roles will be donated to The Richmond Project, a charity Sunak founded with his wife to tackle numeracy problems in the UK, another area he was vocal about while in Downing Street. Posting on social media, Sunak said he would use his roles to ""ensure"" that coming technological change ""delivers the improvements in all of our lives"". Sunak said: ""I have long believed that technology will transform our world and play a key part in determining our future.

6d99f1028105,US kicks off controversial financial rescue plan for Argentina,,"US kicks off controversial financial rescue plan for Argentina Natalie Sherman business reporter and Ione Wells foreign correspondent, Chile Bloomberg via Getty Images Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made the announcement on social media The US has purchased Argentine pesos, taking the next step in a controversial effort to calm a currency crisis hitting the South American country and its president, Trump ally Javier Milei. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the purchase on social media, while saying the US had finalised terms of a planned $20bn (£15bn) financial rescue for the country. ""The US Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted,"" he said. The announcement helped boost the peso and Argentine debt on financial markets but renewed debate in the US, where the decision to extend financial support to Argentina at a time of spending cuts at home has drawn scrutiny. ""Instead of using our dollars to buy Argentine pesos, Donald Trump should help Americans afford health care,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote on social media in response to the announcement, referring to a key issue driving a stand-off over the government shutdown in the US . Argentina has been facing increasing financial turmoil ahead of national midterm elections set for 26 October, as questions rise about whether voters will continue to back Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda after recent losses in a provincial election. The value of the peso has declined sharply in recent months, while investors have been dumping Argentine stocks and bonds. Milei's government has tried to stabilise the situation, but the moves have drained the country's reserves a few months before billions in debt payments will come due. Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader involved in the ""Black Wednesday"" episode in 1992 that forced the UK to devalue the pound, said in a statement that the success of Argentina's ""reform agenda"" was of ""systemic importance"". ""A strong, stable Argentina which helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in the strategic interest of the United States,"" he added. ""Their success should be a bipartisan priority."" The Treasury Department did not respond to questions seeking more detail about the US support, including how much of embattled peso the administration had purchased or the terms of the $20bn currency swap line, which will allow Argentina to exchange pesos for dollars. In a social media post, Milei thanked Trump and Bessent for support. ""Together, as the closest of allies, we will make a hemisphere of economic freedom and prosperity,"" he said. Argentina has defaulted on its debt three times since 2001, including most recently in 2020. But investors, including some with ties to Bessent such as Robert Citrone, had taken renewed interest in the country in recent years in a bet on Milei's libertarian financial reforms. Since he took office in 2023, he has introduced deregulation and sweeping cuts to public spending to curb inflation and achieve a fiscal surplus – where the state spends less than it takes in revenue. Domestically, the austerity measures have been met with growing backlash, as people's purchasing power declines and the country faces a likely economic recession. But those measures have helped to rein in inflation and have been largely welcomed by international investors and the International Monetary Fund, a key lender to Argentina. With Milei styling himself as a Trump-like figure, complete with ""Make Argentina Great Again"" rhetoric, they have also won admiration from many conservatives in the US. He has met repeatedly with Trump, with another visit expected next week. Nonetheless, the decision to extend financial support to Argentina has sparked backlash among American farmers, a key part of Trump's voter base, who have been concerned as China shifts purchases of soybeans to countries including Argentina. ""Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers' biggest market???"" Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who represents Iowa, a key soybean producer, wrote on social media last month, when the US first pledged its support. Bessent's announcement followed four days of meetings with Argentina's economy minister Luis Caputo. In his announcement, Bessent said the international community was ""unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly.  And act we will."" He has previously pushed back at suggestions that the support amounted to a bailout for what Warren, in a statement on Thursday, dubbed the administration's ""billionaire buddies"". ""This trope that we're helping out wealthy Americans with interests down there couldn't be more false,"" Bessent told CNBC earlier this month.

de7c86102369,Tech billionaires seem to be doom prepping. Should we all be worried?,,"Tech billionaires seem to be doom prepping. Should we all be worried? Zoe Kleinman Technology editor BBC Mark Zuckerberg is said to have started work on Koolau Ranch, his sprawling 1,400-acre compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, as far back as 2014. It is set to include a shelter, complete with its own energy and food supplies, though the carpenters and electricians working on the site were banned from talking about it by non-disclosure agreements, according to a report by Wired magazine. A six-foot wall blocked the project from view of a nearby road. Asked last year if he was creating a doomsday bunker, the Facebook founder gave a flat ""no"". The underground space spanning some 5,000 square feet is, he explained, is ""just like a little shelter, it's like a basement"". That hasn't stopped the speculation - likewise about his decision to buy 11 properties in the Crescent Park neighbourhood of Palo Alto in California, apparently adding a 7,000 square feet underground space beneath. Though his building permits refer to basements, according to the New York Times, some of his neighbours call it a bunker. Or a billionaire's bat cave. Bloomberg via Getty Images Zuckerberg spent a reported $110m on adding nearly a dozen properties in a neighbourhood in Palo Alto to his portfolio Then there is the speculation around other Silicon Valley billionaires, some of whom appear to have been busy buying up chunks of land with underground spaces, ripe for conversion into multi-million pound luxury bunkers. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, has talked about ""apocalypse insurance"". This is something about half of the super-wealthy have, he has previously claimed, with New Zealand a popular destination for homes. So, could they really be preparing for war, the effects of climate change, or some other catastrophic event the rest of us have yet to know about? Getty Images Mr Zuckerberg, pictured with his wife Priscilla, has said that the underground space at his Hawaii compound ""just like a little shelter"" In the last few years, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has only added to that list of potential existential woes. Many are deeply worried at the sheer speed of the progression. Ilya Sutskever, chief scientists and a co-founder of the technology company Open AI, is reported to be one them. By mid-2023, the San Francisco-based firm had released ChatGPT - the chatbot now used by hundreds of millions of people across the world - and they were working fast on updates. But by that summer, Mr Sutskever was becoming increasingly convinced that computer scientists were on the brink of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) - the point at which machines match human intelligence - according to a book by journalist Karen Hao. In a meeting, Mr Sutskever suggested to colleagues that they should dig an underground shelter for the company's top scientists before such a powerful technology was released on the world, Ms Hao reports. ""We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,"" he's widely reported to have said, though it's unclear who he meant by ""we"". AFP via Getty Images ""We're definitely going to build a bunker before we release AGI,"" Ilya Sutskever, Open AI co-founder, is reported to have said It sheds light on a strange fact: many leading computer scientists who are working hard to develop a hugely intelligent form of AI, also seem deeply afraid of what it could one day do. So when exactly - if ever - will AGI arrive? And could it really prove transformational enough to make ordinary people afraid? An arrival 'sooner than we think' Tech billionaires have claimed that AGI is imminent. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said in December 2024 that it will come ""sooner than most people in the world think"". Sir Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, has predicted in the next five to ten years, while Anthropic founder Dario Amodei wrote last year that his preferred term - ""powerful AI"" - could be with us as early as 2026. Others are dubious. ""They move the goalposts all the time,"" says Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at Southampton University. ""It depends who you talk to."" We are on the phone but I can almost hear the eye-roll. ""The scientific community says AI technology is amazing,"" she adds, ""but it's nowhere near human intelligence."" There would need to be a number of ""fundamental breakthroughs"" first, agrees Babak Hodjat, chief technology officer of the tech firm Cognizant. What's more, it's unlikely to arrive as a single moment. Rather, AI is a rapidly advancing technology, it's on a journey and there are many companies around the world racing to develop their own versions of it. But one reason the idea excites some in Silicon Valley is that it's thought to be a pre-cursor to something even more advanced: ASI, or artificial super intelligence - tech that surpasses human intelligence. It was back in 1958 that the concept of ""the singularity"" was attributed posthumously to Hungarian-born mathematician John von Neumann. It refers to the moment when computer intelligence advances beyond human understanding. Getty Images John von Neumann is credited with one of the earliest mentions of the singularity concept, long before it had a name - he was a physicist, mathematician, economist and computer scientist More recently, the 2024 book Genesis, written by Eric Schmidt, Craig Mundy and the late Henry Kissinger, explores the idea of a super-powerful technology that becomes so efficient at decision-making and leadership we end up handing control to it completely. It's a matter of when, not if, they argue. Money for all, without needing a job? Those in favour of AGI and ASI are almost evangelical about its benefits. It will find new cures for deadly diseases, solve climate change and invent an inexhaustible supply of clean energy, they argue. Elon Musk has even claimed that super-intelligent AI could usher in an era of ""universal high income"". He recently endorsed the idea that AI will become so cheap and widespread that virtually anyone will want their ""own personal R2-D2 and C-3PO"" (referencing the droids from Star Wars). ""Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,"" he enthused. AFP via Getty Images Elon Musk has endorsed the idea everyone will want their own R2-D2 and C-3PO There is a scary side, of course. Could the tech be hijacked by terrorists and used as an enormous weapon, or what if it decides for itself that humanity is the cause of the world's problems and destroys us? ""If it's smarter than you, then we have to keep it contained,"" warned Tim Berners Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, talking to the BBC earlier this month. ""We have to be able to switch it off."" Getty Images ""Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance,"" billionaire Musk once enthused Governments are taking some protective steps. In the US, where many leading AI companies are based, President Biden passed an executive order in 2023 that required some firms to share safety test results with the federal government - though President Trump has since revoked some of the order, calling it a ""barrier"" to innovation. Meanwhile in the UK, the AI Safety Institute - a government-funded research body - was set up two years ago to better understand the risks posed by advanced AI. And then there are those super-rich with their own apocalypse insurance plans. ""Saying you're 'buying a house in New Zealand' is kind of a wink, wink, say no more,"" Reid Hoffman previously said. The same presumably goes for bunkers. But there's a distinctly human flaw. I once met a former bodyguard of one billionaire with his own ""bunker"", who told me his security team's first priority, if this really did happen, would be to eliminate said boss and get in the bunker themselves. And he didn't seem to be joking. Is it all alarmist nonsense? Neil Lawrence is a professor of machine learning at Cambridge University. To him, this whole debate in itself is nonsense. ""The notion of Artificial General Intelligence is as absurd as the notion of an 'Artificial General Vehicle',"" he argues. ""The right vehicle is dependent on the context. I used an Airbus A350 to fly to Kenya, I use a car to get to the university each day, I walk to the cafeteria… There's no vehicle that could ever do all of this."" For him, talk about AGI is a distraction. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Tech leaders in Silicon Valley - where the world's important AI firms are based - are talking up the prospect of artificial general intelligence ""The technology we have [already] built allows, for the first time, normal people to directly talk to a machine and potentially have it do what they intend. That is absolutely extraordinary… and utterly transformational. ""The big worry is that we're so drawn in to big tech's narratives about AGI that we're missing the ways in which we need to make things better for people."" Current AI tools are trained on mountains of data and are good at spotting patterns: whether tumour signs in scans or the word most likely to come after another in a particular sequence. But they do not ""feel"", however convincing their responses may appear. ""There are some 'cheaty' ways to make a Large Language Model (the foundation of AI chatbots) act as if it has memory and learns, but these are unsatisfying and quite inferior to humans,"" says Mr Hodjat. Vince Lynch, CEO of the California-based IV.AI, is also wary of overblown declarations about AGI. ""It's great marketing,"" he says ""If you are the company that's building the smartest thing that's ever existed, people are going to want to give you money."" He adds, ""It's not a two-years-away thing. It requires so much compute, so much human creativity, so much trial and error."" Asked whether he believes AGI will ever materialise, there's a long pause. ""I really don't know."" Intelligence without consciousness In some ways, AI has already taken the edge over human brains. A generative AI tool can be an expert in medieval history one minute and solve complex mathematical equations the next. Some tech companies say they don't always know why their products respond the way they do. Meta says there are some signs of its AI systems improving themselves. Getty Images News Sam Altman once speculated about joining Peter Thiel at a remote property in New Zealand in the event of global disaster Ultimately, though, no matter how intelligent machines become, biologically the human brain still wins. It has about 86 billion neurons and 600 trillion synapses, many more than the artificial equivalents. The brain doesn't need to pause between interactions, and it is constantly adapting to new information. ""If you tell a human that life has been found on an exoplanet, they will immediately learn that, and it will affect their world view going forward. For an LLM [Large Language Model], they will only know that as long as you keep repeating this to them as a fact,"" says Mr Hodjat. ""LLMs also do not have meta-cognition, which means they don't quite know what they know. Humans seem to have an introspective capacity, sometimes referred to as consciousness, that allows them to know what they know."" It is a fundamental part of human intelligence - and one that is yet to be replicated in a lab. Top picture credits: The Washington Post via Getty Images/ Getty Images MASTER.

a2130678eb41,"Don't force drivers to use parking apps, RAC says",,"Drivers should not be forced to use mobile apps to pay for parking, the RAC has said, after three quarters of drivers it surveyed had issues with them. The most common problem was poor phone signal in the car park, followed by the app not recognising the car park the driver was in. The findings come as the government prepares to expand its National Parking Platform (NPP), which integrates multiple parking platforms into a single app. The RAC welcomed the NPP but said more local authorities and parking companies needed to sign up. RAC senior policy officer Rod Dennis said parking operators ""should offer drivers at least two different ways to pay"". ""Parking should, in theory at least, be one of the simplest tasks any driver completes but having to navigate a variety of differently designed apps – and register an account, vehicle details and bank cards with each one – can be a pain,"" he said. ""No-one should be forced to use to a mobile app when parking if they don't want to, especially those who struggle with technology or just don't have a smartphone."" The RAC survey of 1,700 people found that 13% of respondents didn't know to pay for parking via app. Of the respondents over 75, this figure was 26%. Nearly half of those surveyed said they preferred to pay by card or contactless payment on their phones. BBC News visited Deansgate North Q-Park in Manchester to find out what drivers thought of the findings. One young man said using the apps was ""easy"" but his preferred method to pay for parking was Apple Pay on his phone. Another said he got a ticket after having trouble connecting to a parking app. ""I had to send receipts to basically prove I had a parking permit."" Another man said he was now used to downloading parkinh apps now but added: ""I think it'd be miles easier if it was one app."" Following a trial in 10 local authorities in England, the government announced in May that the National Parking Platform (NPP) would be expanded across the country — but car park and app providers have to opt in. The app is run on a not-for-profit basis by the British Parking Association (BPA), which represents parking operators. Mr Dennis said the RAC welcomed the launch of the NPP, which ""should spell the end of drivers needing to download lots of separate apps just to park and simplify things enormously"". He added: ""This does depend on enough local authorities and parking companies up and down the country signing up, though."" The RAC said that if drivers run into signal issues while trying to pay for parking, they should collect evidence of their attempts to pay, including screenshots of any app error messages. The BPA said it welcomed the increase in use of parking apps, but added it was ""vital that technology works for everyone."" In a statement, the association said: ""Our members are committed to making parking as simple and accessible as possible, and we actively encourage operators to offer a range of payment options, including cashless and traditional methods to meet the needs of all drivers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce847ngn7n8o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7ee5/live/e6efa9b0-a523-11f0-adbe-83a1eb509ffb.jpg,2025-10-09T23:05:56.132000+00:00,cfa4b3c650977255d741e54361b8118446a65620
c224b2263bb7,Has the clock stopped on Swiss US trade?,,"Has the clock stopped on Swiss US trade? Imogen Foulkes Bern, Switzerland AFP via Getty Images So far President Karin Keller-Sutter has failed to reduce US tariffs on Swiss goods President Trump's tariffs have caused shock worldwide, with governments scrambling to find a deal to placate him. Some have managed: the UK got in first, with a sweet deal of just 10%, the European Union crept in behind with 15%. Still more than they were paying before Mr Trump's ""liberation day"", but less than they had feared. Spare a thought then for Switzerland, which has been hit with punitive tariffs of 39%, and has so far been unable to persuade the US president to relent. Switzerland is not in the EU, so it can't benefit from the deal struck by Brussels. But Switzerland is regularly ranked as the world's most competitive and innovative economy. It is also one of the biggest investors in the US, creating, Swiss business leaders say, 400,000 jobs. That's why they find the US strategy not only outrageous, but inexplicable. ""Thirty nine percent tariffs: I was just shocked,"" says Jan Atteslander, director of international relations for the Swiss business federation Economiesuisse. ""This is unjustified, you can't explain why they are so high."" Getty Images Around 17% of Swiss exports go to the US Since the tariffs (the highest in Europe and the fourth-highest worldwide) were announced on 1 August, the Swiss government has been desperately trying to renegotiate with Washington, to no avail. The US president, it seems, has moved on to other matters. Around 17% of all Swiss exports go to the US, a market Switzerland cannot afford to lose overnight. Now that the tariffs have come into effect, the once muscular Swiss economy is suffering. Economic growth is shrinking, and job losses in key industries appear inevitable. Switzerland's most lucrative exports to the US are pharmaceuticals. Ironically, they are not affected by the 39% tariffs, but might be subject to the 100% tariff on imported medicines that Trump recently threatened. That would be another huge blow. Another big Swiss exporter to the US is Switzerland's world-leading medical technology industry. ""It's precision mechanics, it has its roots in the watchmaking industry,"" explains Adrian Hunn, who is managing director of Swiss Medtech, the trade body representing the industry. MPS The US is an important market for precision instrument firms like MPS The town of Biel, the historic home of Swiss watchmaking, and now the site of medical technology companies, demonstrates why there may be no winners, but only losers, from Washington's tariff policy. The company MPS (short for micro precision systems), produces medical instruments from aortic valve replacements to the tiniest of surgical drills, used in hip or knee replacements. Just the kind of things a wealthy country with an ageing, and increasingly overweight population – like the US – needs. So precise is the production process, that even the machines used to produce the devices are made and specially calibrated locally. ""It's a very integrated way of working,"" explains MPS's CEO Gilles Robert. ""Measuring equipment, milling tools, cutting liquids. That's why we call it an ecosystem that we have here in Switzerland."" Mr Robert's proudest product is the engine for the world's only medically-registered artificial heart. Just 120 of them have been transplanted worldwide. ""It's a pump that will pulse in both sides, to create beating in both chambers, and allow people currently waiting for a transplant, people with terminal heart deficiencies, to keep on living."" Technology like this is very different from the car industry, where, often, the brakes are made in one country, the windscreen wipers or door handles in another, and everything is assembled in a third. That's why Mr Robert is not convinced that Trump's stated strategy of moving production to the US could work. ""It would be extremely challenging if not impossible to separate the components from the actual product assembly,"" he says. ""And I think those types of skills would be extremely hard to find in the US."" MPS It would be ""extremely challenging"" to move production to the US, says Gilles Robert Trump has said the countries hit with tariffs will ""eat them"". So can MPS absorb the 39%? ""They had the best price before the new tariffs came into effect,"" says Mr Robert. ""We don't have the leeway to give a discount to our customers, because the margins are already as low as they can be."" Instead, says Adrian Hunn of SwissMedTech, ""Medical devices will get more expensive for US patients."" And he adds, probably for US taxpayers as well. ""Costs for hospitals and healthcare systems in the US in many cases are funded by public reimbursement programmes, and this means taxpayers bear the burden."" Perhaps even more worrying for patients, since some high precision medical devices are made only in Switzerland, is the possibility that Swiss companies will stop exporting to the US altogether. ""These are companies that have very good products,"" says Jan Atteslander of Economiesuisse. ""And they have told us, we just stopped delivering, sorry guys."" Mr Atteslander and Mr Hunn agree with the Swiss government's strategy of not retaliating to the US tariffs. Switzerland's David, the thinking goes, cannot realistically take on America's Goliath. But the Swiss are actively chasing other markets. A trade deal with India –  ""the fastest growing economy on the planet, 1.4 billion potential consumers,"" Mr Atteslander points out – came into force on 1 October. An agreement with South American trade block Mercosur has also just been concluded, Switzerland's longstanding trade deal with China is being upgraded, and free trade with the EU, the market for 50% of all Swiss export, remains intact. So although the US tariffs are already damaging the Swiss economy, and some still cling to hope that Trump may change his mind, there is also a quiet confidence that Switzerland will, if it has to, weather this storm. ""To be a successful export nation, you have to have resilience in your DNA,"" says Mr Atteslander. The more long-term damage may be to the traditionally good business relations between the two countries. In Switzerland, there is a real feeling of hurt. The US wasn't just an important market: the Swiss loved doing business there. Many thought they had found entrepreneurial soulmates, more oriented to the free market than their more regulated partners in the EU. Now, both Adrian Hunn of SwissMedTech and Gilles Robert of MPS have abandoned that notion – for now at least. ""I lived six years in the US, so I was very close,"" says Mr Hunn. ""I have a lot of friends there. So, this, it didn't change my view of America, but it did change my view, you know, of how the current administration in the US is acting globally, and treating allies."" ""I studied a year in the US,"" says Mr Robert. ""It had an impact on me, on my way of looking at the world. How you can take risks, be an entrepreneur, and be positive about the future."" But, he adds hopefully: ""Even though I'm sad about this situation, we will overcome, we'll find solutions, and I'm sure in the end reason will prevail.""

642ecef9b0ef,Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty,,"Huge buzz but a big gamble: Battlefield 6 takes aim at Call of Duty Georgia Levy-Collins BBC Newsbeat EA Battlefield 6 has its sights on success - but can it hit its target? ""A new challenger has appeared."" In the fiercely competitive world of video games, it's common for new contenders to fade away as quickly as they burst on to the scene. But Battlefield 6 is hoping to change that. It's the latest entry in a long-running military shooter series often framed as a grittier, more realistic answer to Call of Duty. The title's never quite managed to match its most famous rival in terms of sales or players, but there are signs the new installment could close the gap. A preview weekend giving players a chance to try out the game earlier this year broke records, and the buzz heading into its launch has been huge. But the project is still a big gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA), which has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars making it. BBC Newsbeat's spoken to some of the makers to find out how they hope it will pay off. Four EA-owned studios have been working on the game under the Battlefield Studios banner. They include original series developer Dice, based in Sweden, LA's Motive Studios and Ripple Effect Studios in Canada. The fourth, Criterion, is based in Guildford, UK. Rebecka Coutaz is the general manager of the two European studios, and tells Newsbeat that, in terms of what it's offering players, ""Battlefield 6 is probably unbeatable"". EA Rebecka Coutaz is in charge of Battlefield's European studios The game comes off the back of the futuristic Battlefield 2042, released four years ago to a negative reception it struggled to recover from. ""We probably couldn't make and develop Battlefield 6 without the learnings we had in Battlefield 2042,"" Rebekah tells Newsbeat. One of those lessons was to get fans involved early, and the team launched invite-only community playtests earlier this year. The ""feedback was explosively positive,"" says Rebecka. Another missing ingredient from Battlefield 2042 was a single-player campaign, which has been restored this time around. Criterion design director Fasahat ""Fas"" Salim is the one in charge of ""making sure those missions are as fun and interesting as possible for the players"". Despite claims that the scale of the project had put a strain on the different studios collaborating across continents to build the game, Fas is positive about the process. ""Collaborating with different cultures, different backgrounds, it's a really interesting environment to be involved in every day,"" he says. ""This whole approach has been something new but something really exciting because we are working with people from all over the world."" As for the expectation on the team, Fas says: ""There is pressure but also it's exciting. ""It's a big project. It's probably the biggest that most of us have ever worked on."" Vlad is completing his BA in Visual Effects at Bournemouth University alongside his role at Criterion That's definitely true of at least one team member, lighting artist Vlad Kokhan. The 21-year-old makes the atmospheric effects that shape the mood, tone, and direction of the single-player campaign. He completed an internship at Criterion before getting a job there, and currently works part-time while finishing his visual effects degree at Bournemouth University. Vlad says he's a long-time fan of the Battlefield series, and remembers playing the fourth instalment of the series at a friend's house when he was younger. To be working on it now, as his first industry job, ""doesn't feel real"". ""It's really crazy seeing the marketing everywhere"", he says. ""To know that I've put my own thing into the game is really surreal."" A hand-painted mural of the game at EA's Guildford office Battlefield 6's launch is expected to be a big one, with analysts predicting it could sell up to five millions copies in its first week . But its real success in a volatile and unpredictable industry won't be clear for months, if not years. To maintain the momentum, it will need to draw - and keep - players away from rivals including CoD, Fortnite and Roblox. But while the signs are promising, Rebecka is cautious when asked if she is feeling confident. ""I would say yes and no, you never know,"" she says. ""The only thing that matters to me now - and I've been saying it for four years - is that we don't disappoint our community, our players."" Concerns for Battlefield's future were also sparked by recent news that EA had agreed to sell the company to a Saudi Arabia-led group for $55bn (£41bn) . EA has taken on $20bn (£14bn) of debt as part of the deal - known as a leveraged buyout - prompting fans to fear of cutbacks. The company has told staff to expect ""no immediate changes"" to their jobs. For Battlefield 6, Rebecka tells Newsbeat the team will continue as planned, and has already shared details for monthly updates and content additions. ""I am here to help our team members make their best work in their careers so the way hasn't changed for me, the way is still the same,"" she insists. Fas is responsible for the single-player missions in the new game EA has been vocal about its plans to use generative AI in game development, and its prospective new owners are betting on the technology to boost profits, according to The Financial Times . The tools are controversial, prompting concerns from developers and backlash from some fans. Rebecka tells Newsbeat players won't see anything made by GenAI within Battlefield 6, but it is used in preparatory stages to ""to allow more time and more space to be creative."" Rebecka says GenAI ""is very seducing"", but there isn't currently a way to incorporate it into developer's daily work. Yet she shares EA's optimism for its potential. ""If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,"" she says. In Fas's opinion, GenAI is ""not anything to be scared of in our industry"". ""Especially as we work in an environment at the bleeding edge of technology - we're kind of used to things changing,"" he says. ""It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows, how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level."" For now, though, the team's focus is on nailing Battlefield 6's release. ""We spend a lot of time behind closed doors making these things,"" says Fas. ""But when it goes into the players' hands and you see them having a great time, people shouting, people excited, that's something that we worked years for. ""This is what most of us game developers look forward to. We just want to see people play the thing and then get excited about it.""

f79688287f62,Thousands more university jobs cut as financial crisis deepens,,"Thousands more university jobs cut as financial crisis deepens Hayley Clarke Education reporter and Emily Doughty PA Media University and College Union (UCU) members at Edinburgh University took industrial action in September Universities have collectively announced more than 12,000 job cuts in the last year, new analysis from the University and College Union (UCU) suggests. Additional cost savings announced in the same period are equivalent to a further 3,000 jobs, the union says, but universities have not confirmed whether these savings will be made by cutting staff. UCU members will vote on potential UK-wide strike action later this month over a 1.4% pay offer made over the summer. Employers say that offer ""clearly does not reflect the true value employers place on staff"", but that it is the ""only prudent option"" given the scale of the financial challenge facing the higher education sector. Four in 10 English universities are now believed to be in financial deficit, according to the Office for Students. Raj Jethwa, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), says difficult decisions like redundancies and restructures are having to be ""carefully considered"" by all institutions, but that they were striving to do so in an ""open and fair way"". But Jo Grady, UCU general secretary, described the cuts as ""brutal"", adding that staff had become ""demoralised, exhausted and furious"" and that ""undervalued and poorly served"" students were feeling the impact too. The government said it had taken the ""tough but necessary decision"" to increase tuition fees last year to boost income for universities, and would soon set out further plans for reforms in new legislation. 'I will have to live with my mum in my forties' Zak Hughes Dr Zak Hughes had to submit his expression of interest in keeping his role alongside submitting exams for his modules over the summer Dr Zak Hughes, a chemistry lecturer at the University of Bradford, is at risk of redundancy. ""There are a lot of stressed and upset people who are struggling to deal with it, both within the school but also more widely within the institution,"" he says. Zak, who has worked at the university since 2018, says he now faces the prospect of having to move back home to live with his mum if he loses his job. ""I won't be able to pay my rent, I will be in my forties and living back at home,"" he says. Even if the 44-year-old retains his job, the chemistry course at the university is being phased out, with similar closures happening across the country. Zak says this limits the opportunities for him and his colleagues. ""People could, even if they lost their job, get a job at another institution. That's not happening now,"" he says. ""They're probably looking not only at the end of the a job, but really the end of their career in academia."" Sanskrity Baraili, sabbatical officer at the students' union in Bradford, says she has already seen the impact of cuts on students, especially in support services such as cleaning teams and disability services. While she believes the cuts come from a wider issue within higher education, she says ""students are worried about what's going to happen next"". Sanskrity Baraili Sanskrity believes she had an easier time as a student than those currently studying at the university A spokesperson for the university said: ""Like many other universities, we are having to make cost-savings to protect the student experience and ensure we deliver meaningful outcomes for graduates. ""Our priority remains putting students first and widening access to higher education."" They added that the university had a responsibility to ensure it remained financially stable, including regularly reviewing courses with ""persistently low intake such as chemistry"". They called on the government to take ""swift and decisive action"" to tackle the challenges faced by the sector. 'I'd have had second thoughts about uni if I knew' The University of Edinburgh has announced it plans to make £140m in cuts , equivalent to about 1,800 jobs, according to the UCU. Caspar Cubitt, who is studying theology, says the uncertainty has ""put all of us on edge"". ""There's a lot of gossip which swirls around you,"" he says. ""It's when you write back to your mum and dad and they ask how uni is going, you say, 'Well, my degree is in trouble.'"" While the 22-year-old says he is still receiving the same level of support from his department, he has found that access to study spaces and module choices has been affected. With two years left at university, he is now worried what further cuts may mean. ""I would have had second thoughts [about going to Edinburgh] if I knew that this is how they handle budget crisis and this is how they run finances,"" he says. Professor Sir Peter Mathieson, principal and vice chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said the university had been ""fully transparent about the necessary steps we need to take to safeguard the future of our university"". ""We remain firmly committed to ongoing dialogue as we take the necessary steps to enable us to deliver excellence and continue to be a bold, imaginative and world-leading university.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3ve5jegkvo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6afc/live/e9db0200-a5a0-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T01:05:07.038000+00:00,551bdc6031acb4377c6654dc584b8d1ea9a88b78

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has designated Google with ""strategic market status"" under a law which came into force in January. The decision does not mean the regulator has found wrongdoing at this stage. Instead, it opens the door to what it called ""proportionate, targeted interventions"" to ensure the market is competitive. Google has warned against any measures which its says might ""inhibit UK innovation and growth."" The CMA said it expected to begin a consultation on what changes might be introduced later in 2025. In response to the announcement, Google has attempted to emphasise what it sees as the advantages of the regulatory status quo. ""UK businesses and consumers have been amongst the first to benefit from Google's innovations, often months before their European counterparts,"" Google's competition boss Oliver Bethell wrote in a blog post. ""As a result, they see significant value: Google Search contributes billions of pounds a year to the UK economy — £118 billion in 2023 alone. ""Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation."" Roadmap of measures The CMA said Google's market dominance was unquestionable. ""We have found that Google maintains a strategic position in the search and search advertising sector – with more than 90% of searches in the UK taking place on its platform,"" CMA digital markets boss Will Hayter said. ""Having taken into account the feedback received following our proposed decision, we have today designated Google's search services with strategic market status."" The CMA previously unveiled what it called a ""roadmap"" of potential measures it could take if Google was found to have significant market status. It said it could potentially force the tech giant to include ""choice screens"" which would let users see alternative search providers, as well as giving publishers more control over how their content was used. It also included what it called ""fair principles"" for how websites are ranked in search results, and an ""effective complaints process"" for businesses unhappy about their listing. The move has been well-received by consumer groups, with Which? policy boss Rocio Concha calling it ""an important step"". ""The CMA's careful evidence gathering makes a compelling argument,"" she said.

d3bc42e292f4,What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget?,,"What are National Insurance and income tax and what could change in the Budget? Getty Images There has been speculation that November's Budget could see Chancellor Rachel Reeves break Labour's pre-election pledge not to increase income tax, National Insurance (NI) or VAT for working people. It's suggested that she could announce changes to NI and income tax, including extending a freeze to the income thresholds at which people start paying the taxes, or have to pay more. What is National Insurance and what does it pay for? The government uses National Insurance to pay benefits and help fund the NHS. It is paid by employees, employers and the self-employed across the UK. Those over the state pension age do not pay it, even if they are working. Eligibility for some benefits, including the state pension, depends on the National Insurance contributions (NICs) you make across your working life. It may be possible to make voluntary payments to fill gaps in your contribution history. How much do employees pay in National Insurance? The type and amount of NI you pay depends on your age, employment status and income. Workers start paying NI when they turn 16 and earn more than £242 a week, or have self-employed profits of more than £12,570 a year. The amount owed is usually deducted automatically from employees' wages along with income tax. The starting rate for NI for employees fell twice in 2024: from 12% to 10%, and then again to 8%. The previous Conservative government said these cuts were worth about £900 a year for a worker earning £35,000. For the self-employed , the rate of NI paid on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 fell from 9% to 6%. This was said to be worth £350 to a self-employed person earning £28,200. Most self-employed people pay their NICs through their self assessment tax return . The NI rate on income and profits above £50,270 is 2% for all workers. How much do employers pay in National Insurance? Since April 2025, employers pay NI at 15% on most employees' wages above £5,000. They previously paid 13.8% on salaries above £9,100. Businesses also pay 15% NI on expenses and benefits they give to their staff - such as company cars or health insurance. The employment allowance - the amount employers can claim back from their NI bill - rose from £5,000 to £10,500. What are the current income tax rates? You have to pay income tax on your earnings from employment, or profits from self-employment, above the tax-free personal allowance of £12,570. Income tax is also paid on some benefits and pensions , income from renting out property, and returns from savings and investments above certain limits. The basic rate of 20% is paid on annual earnings between £12,571 and £50,270. The higher rate of 40% is paid on earnings between £50,271 and £125,140. Once you earn more than £100,000, you also start losing the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance . You lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 that your income goes above £100,000. Anyone earning more than £125,140 a year no longer has any tax-free personal allowance. They also pay an additional rate of income tax of 45% on all earnings above that amount. These rates apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some income tax rates are different in Scotland , where a new 45% band took effect in April 2024. At the same time the top rate also rose from 47% to 48%. What are NI and income tax thresholds and why do they matter? Changes to the income thresholds mean that millions are paying more tax overall, despite the 2024 NI cuts. The thresholds are the income levels at which people start paying NI or income tax, or have to pay higher rates. These used to rise every year in line with inflation. However, the previous Conservative government froze the NI threshold and tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 until 2028.  It also kept the higher-rate tax threshold at £50,270. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the chancellor have both refused to rule out extending the current freeze. Freezing the thresholds means that more people start paying tax and NI as their wages increase, and more people pay higher rates. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think thank, the freeze cancelled out the benefits of the 2024 NI cuts for some workers. In the 2024-25 tax year, it said an average earner would have a tax cut of about £340 - from the combined tax changes - and people earning between £26,000 and £60,000 would be better off. But by 2027, it said the average earner would be only £140 better off - and only people earning between £32,000 and £55,000 a year would still benefit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q51vl18yo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d97b/live/fd25fee0-9f93-11f0-b9ae-cbef91e6ae73.jpg,2025-10-10T11:20:32.625000+00:00,e0250bfd11f85c59b712bb203cceeda62f321188
8c70756fdf33,OpenAI video app Sora hits 1 million downloads faster than ChatGPT,,"OpenAI says the latest version of its text-to-video artificial intelligence (AI) tool Sora was downloaded over a million times in less than five days - hitting the milestone faster than ChatGPT did at launch. The app, which has topped the Apple App Store charts in the US, generates ten second long realistic-looking videos from simple text prompts. The figures were announced in an X post from Sora boss Bill Peebles , who said the  ""surging growth"" came even though the app was only available to people in North America who had received an invite. But its handling of copyright material - and the images of dead public figures - has attracted significant criticism online despite the growth. The Sora app - which makes it easy for users to post videos they have created to social media - has resulted in a deluge of videos on social feeds. Some have included depictions of deceased celebrities such as musicians Michael Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Three days ago, Zelda Williams, the daughter of Robin Williams, asked people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father, the celebrated US actor and comic who died in 2014. A plea that press reports have linked to the popularity of Sora. An OpenAI spokesperson told US news site Axios in an email there were ""strong free speech interests"" in allowing the depiction of historical figures. But the spokesperson said, for public figures who were ""recently deceased"", authorized persons could request their likenesses aren't used - though it did not specify what counted as ""recent"". Videos also frequently feature depictions of characters from films, TV and games. In one Sora deepfake of Sam Altman, the OpenAI boss is shown with several Pokémon characters saying ""I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us"", CNBC reported . In another viral deepfake video he grills and eats the game's infamous Pikachu mascot. Nintendo has not revealed any plans to take legal action, but several companies behind popular generative AI systems, including OpenAI, are currently locked in legal battles with the creators and rights holders of creative works. The potential cost of these battles is high. AI firm Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5bn (£1.11bn) to settle a class action lawsuit filed by authors who said the company stole their work to train its AI models. OpenAI says it is adapting its approach to these issues. On 4 October, Mr Altman blogged that the firm had been ""learning quickly from how people are using Sora and taking feedback from users, rights holders, and other interested groups"". He said the firm would ""give rights holders more granular control over generation of characters"". And he said there were plans for some form of revenue-sharing in the future. But it remains to be seen if rights holders will agree Sora videos are a new kind of ""interactive fan fiction"" as Mr Altman suggested - or whether it will force the firm to face a grilling in the civil courts.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjgrvg6z4o,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d25b/live/a79c0710-a5cb-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T12:30:07.819000+00:00,c8f5b69806669f40e22a9bf21bab8fedd391e5d4
9ba907854b4c,Lib Dems back Bank of England after Farage criticism,,"The Liberal Democrats have promised to back the Bank of England's (BoE) independence ""against Farage's threats"" after the Reform leader urged it to end its bond-selling programme. On Friday, party leader Sir Ed Davey and his deputy Daisy Cooper met the bank's governor Andrew Bailey to ""reaffirm support"" for the Bank's autonomy. It comes two weeks after Nigel Farage met Mr Bailey to argue for the end of BoE bond sales, known as quantitative tightening, claiming it is costing taxpayers billions and driving up debt. Sir Ed accused Farage of ""putting his obsession with mimicking Donald Trump ahead of what is in the best interests of the British people"" by pressuring the central bank. Reform UK has been approached for comment. Sir Ed has pledged to lead the fight against Reform UK - using his Lib Dem conference speech to argue his party had a ""moral responsibility"" to challenge Farage. Speaking after his meeting at the Bank's Threadneedle Street HQ, Sir Ed said: ""Liberal Democrats will stand firmly behind Bank of England independence, just as we have stood against recent attacks on the independence of our judiciary. ""Trump's threats to sack governors of the Fed if they don't do what he wants are causing economic panic in the United States,"" Sir Ed said. ""That is the last thing we need here at home - we cannot let Trump's America become Farage's Britain."" Speaking to reporters later, Sir Ed argued the BoE needed ""modernisation"" but argued keeping it independent from government was ""the best way"" to lower food bills and mortgage rates. The Bank began its quantitative tightening programme in 2022 , unwinding the emergency support it brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. That earlier process, known as quantitative easing, saw the Bank electronically create billions of pounds to buy UK government bonds, a form of debt, in a bid to prop up the UK economy by keeping market interest rates low. The Bank subsequently launched new rounds of QE after the eurozone debt crisis, the Brexit referendum and the coronavirus pandemic. The Bank is now in the process of selling these bonds for less than it paid for them, with losses being picked up by the Treasury under a deal agreed in 2009. Reform has criticised the process, with deputy leader Richard Tice branding it a ""systemic misuse of taxpayers' money"" in a letter to Bailey in June. He also blamed it for increasing the costs of long-term government debt, which recently rose to a 27-year high. Farage and Tice visited the Bank for talks with Bailey on 25 September, after the Bank chief agreed to a meeting. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Tice called for MPs to take a more active role in debating the policy, arguing they were reluctant to do so for fear of encroaching on the bank's independence. But he added that the ""huge multibillion cost"" meant it had an impact on taxation, traditionally a matter for Parliament, and could ""change the decisions the chancellor makes"" at November's Budget. They also pressed the Bank to relax its stance on cryptocurrencies, accusing it of holding back innovation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr70g372m91o,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f8b/live/711129e0-a5d6-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-10T12:42:29.008000+00:00,3541b736e9fabbb59610cfe31eab6e6dcb8a8f9e

In a post on social media, Trump said he now saw ""no reason"" to meet with President Xi later this month, accusing China of ""becoming very hostile"" and trying to hold the world ""captive"". He also threatened a ""massive"" increase in tariffs on Chinese goods, indicating a return of renewed trade tensions between the two economic giants. Financial markets dropped in the wake of the remarks, with the S&P 500 down roughly 1.4% in late morning trade in New York. As well as tightening rules for exports of rare earths, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker.

Available for over a year

Donald Trump once dismissed cryptocurrencies as a scam. But since returning to office, his view of them has shifted dramatically. 

In July, President Trump signed new legislation aimed at integrating crypto into the financial mainstream. Members of the Trump family have launched their own ventures, generating significant profits and boosting the visibility of digital currencies in American politics. 

Supporters say this could reassert the dominance of the US dollar in a changing global economy, while critics warn of economic volatility and regulatory gaps. How did crypto go from fringe to front-and-centre in Trump’s economic vision?

This week on The Inquiry, we’re asking: Is Trump building a crypto economy?

5534a4ad4056,How hackers forced brewing giant Asahi back to pen and paper,,"How hackers forced brewing giant Asahi back to pen and paper Suranjana Tewari Asia business correspondent, Tokyo and Peter Hoskins Business reporter Reuters Asahi Super Dry is Japan's most popular beer Only four bottles of Asahi Super Dry beer are left on the shelves of Ben Thai, a cosy restaurant in the Tokyo suburb of Sengawacho. Its owner, Sakaolath Sugizaki, expects to get a few more soon, but she says her supplier is keeping the bulk of its stock for bigger customers. That's because Asahi, the maker of Japan's best-selling beer, was forced to halt production at most of its 30 factories in the country at the end of last month after being hit by a cyber-attack. While all of its facilities in Japan - including six breweries - have now partially reopened, its computer systems are still down. That means it has to process orders and shipments manually - using pen, paper and fax machines - resulting in much fewer shipments than before the attack. Asahi accounts for about 40% of Japan's beer market, so its problems are having a major impact on bars, restaurants and retailers. The company has apologised ""for any difficulties caused by the recent attack"" but has not yet said when it expects its operations to be fully up and running again. The BBC visited convenience stores and supermarkets in Tokyo and Hokkaido - where workers said they were selling their current stock and hadn't been able to place new orders for Asahi products, which also include water and food items. Hisako Arisawa, who runs a liquor store in Tokyo, says she is worried about her customers as she can only get a few bottles of Super Dry at a time and expects the disruption to go on for at least a month. The problem isn't just affecting beer, she adds, there are also shortages of Asahi's soft drinks, such as ginger beer and soda water. Getty Images Convenience stores in Japan have warned of shortages of Asahi products Last week, some of the country's biggest convenience store chains warned their customers to expect shortages . FamilyMart said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock. 7-Eleven halted shipments in Japan of Asahi products, while Lawsons also said it expected shortages. Mr Nakano, who didn't want to share his first name, works for an alcohol wholesaler. While some shipments from Asahi have resumed, he says he is only getting about 10-20% of the normal amount. His orders are now handwritten and taken by fax. Asahi notifies him by fax when lorries are ready to leave its factory. Asahi also owns big brands in Europe - such as Peroni, Grolsch, and the British brewer Fuller's - but the firm has said those operations have not been affected by the cyber-attack. Ransomware group Qilin - which has previously hacked other major organisations - has claimed responsibility for the attack on Asahi. It operates a platform that allows users to carry out cyber-attacks in exchange for a percentage of extortion proceeds. Asahi has not confirmed the nature of the attack on its operations but has said data suspected to have been leaked in the hack had been found on the internet. It is the latest in a series of cyber-attacks by other hacking groups that have hit major firms around the world, including carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and retail giant Marks and Spencer . Travellers were delayed at a number of European airports in September after a ransomware attack disrupted check-in and boarding software. Back in Japan, a cyber-attack paralysed operations at a container terminal in the city of Nagoya for three days in 2024. Japan Airlines was also hacked last Christmas, causing delays and cancellations to domestic flights. AFP via Getty Images A cyber-attack on Japan Airlines caused flight delays and cancellations While Japan's image around the world may be of a technologically advanced nation, some experts have warned it does not have enough cybersecurity professionals and has low rates of digital literacy when it comes to business software. This issue was highlighted last year when officials finally stopped asking people to submit documents to the government using floppy disks , even though they fell out of fashion in much of the rest of the world in the 1990s. Japan is vulnerable to cyber-attacks ""given a reliance on legacy systems and a society with a high level of trust,"" Cartan McLaughlin from Nihon Cyber Defence Group told the BBC. Many organisations in the country are not prepared for attacks and are willing to pay ransoms, which makes them attractive to hackers, he added. Speaking at a news conference this week, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the Asahi cyber-attack was being investigated. ""We will continue to improve our cyber capabilities,"" he added. Earlier this year, the Japanese government passed a landmark law giving it more powers in the event of cyber-attacks. Experts have praised the Active Cyber Defense Law (ACD), because it allows the government to share more information with companies, and also empowers the police and Japan's Self-Defense Forces to mount their own attacks to neutralise attackers' servers. But that is little consolation to small businesses like Ben Thai restaurant and its customers. Owner Sakaolath says she's not sure what will happen the next time she puts in an order for Super Dry, and nor do many others across Japan.

1c0bd0683913,Windows 10 users urged to prepare for Microsoft pulling support,,"Windows 10 users urged to prepare for Microsoft pulling support Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter and Liv McMahon Technology reporter Getty Images Microsoft is encouraging users to update to Windows 11 There is a big change coming for many people who use Windows computers. Microsoft is ending support for its Windows 10 operating system, which means that after Tuesday 14 October, these computers may be at risk. This is because security updates will stop, making devices more vulnerable to attack. Microsoft is encouraging people to upgrade for free to Windows 11 - but not all computers will be able to do that. ""The end of support for Windows 10 is shaping up to be a disaster for both consumers and the environment,"" said Nathan Proctor, senior director at US consumer group PIRG. So, what does it mean for you? Who is affected? Windows is the world's most popular computer operating system, with Microsoft saying it is used on over 1.4 billion devices around the globe. Around 43% of these were using Windows 10 in July 2025, according to Statcounter . In the UK, consumer guide Which? estimates there could be 21 million people still using Windows 10. In September, it ran a survey which found about a quarter of those users were planning to continue to use it even after Microsoft's official support ends. About one in seven said they planned to buy a new computer. Other consumer groups have criticised the end of Windows 10 support, saying it will lead to unnecessary spending and environmental waste. ""People are tired of living in a world filled with short-lived devices we can't fix, or lose software support or are otherwise forced into the waste stream,"" said Mr Proctor, who campaigns for the right to repair in the US. He added: ""We deserve tech that lasts."" What do I need to do? Microsoft is essentially giving personal users two options: Update to Windows 11, or sign up to receive extended security updates for 12 months. These can be done in the ""Privacy and Security"" section of your settings. People who own PCs eligible for Windows 11 can upgrade for free. However, many people ""will have to purchase new devices - despite the fact that their current computers work just fine,"" said Mr Proctor. If you don't want to upgrade straight away, or your device is too old for Windows 11, you can sign up to a scheme which will continue the most important security updates until October 2026. This is called Extended Security Updates (ESU) - but it does not offer any technical support or other software updates. People living in the European Economic Area will get it for free by registering. For other users to get it for free, they need to have updated to the latest version of Windows 10,  have a Microsoft account and backed up their PC settings. Otherwise, you have to pay a $30 (£22) fee or use 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points to access ESU. For commercial organisations using Windows 10, it will cost $61 per device. The exact amount you pay depends on where in the world you live. Getty Images What's changing? Since its release in 2015, Microsoft has kept Windows 10 going with frequent software updates. These have been used to tweak or add new features, as well as patch security issues and bugs. The company recommends users upgrade to Windows 11 for free - but some older devices won't be able to run the new operating system. It is also making it harder to use Windows 11 without a Microsoft account - and one way to extend the life of your Windows 10 machine also requires a Microsoft account. Some users prefer not to log in with a Microsoft account for privacy reasons. What's the risk? Microsoft will stop sending critical security updates and fixes to Windows 10 PCs. That can make your device more vulnerable to threats such as viruses or malicious software - as you won't get the latest defences against attacks. We have seen a number of high-profile cyber-attacks in recent months, to businesses ranging from retailers to car manufacturers and even a nursery chain. Companies may also ""find it challenging to maintain regulatory compliance with unsupported software"", Microsoft Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi wrote in a blog post .

0f41a9ccbed6,'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley,,"'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley Lily Jamali Technology correspondent, San Francisco Getty Images Silicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquarters At OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters. ""I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,"" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. ""In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now."" In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call ""financial engineering"". In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued. Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money. But with OpenAI, he told me, ""there's something real happening here"". Not everyone is convinced. In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC ""the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds"". And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing. At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles. Getty Images Jerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computers He's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose. ""When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,"" he said. ""It's going to drag down the rest of the economy."" However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise. ""It is very hard to time a bubble,"" Prof Admati told me. ""And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst."" But the data is concerning to many. AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out. Tangled web of deals OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny. For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips. Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders. Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars . Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too. OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs. Getty Images OpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand. Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals ""circular financing"" or even ""vendor financing"" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases. ""Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,"" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, ""it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast."" OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit. And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests. ""They can use it to do anything they like,"" Huang said. ""There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem."" Telltale signs Mr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble. In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for. Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action. The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built. ""We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,"" Mr Kaplan said. Getty Images OpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year. But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessarily go to waste. ""The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,"" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face. ""If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,"" he said. ""But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today."" There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society. The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up. ""Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,"" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter. ""Who else has the capacity right now to invest $100 billion in another company?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69qy760weo,technology,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bf9b/live/ff11e480-a5e2-11f0-920e-cb66ee1d5eb0.jpg,2025-10-10T23:55:36.318000+00:00,1c46e767dc854e866704c109817240cacdae5b67

a6009578fcaf,China accuses US of 'double standards' over tariff threat,,"Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is ""a typical example of US double standards"", China's government has said. A Commerce Ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified ""countermeasures"" if the US President carries out his threat, adding it was ""not afraid"" of a possible trade war. On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of ""becoming very hostile"" and trying to hold the world ""captive"". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping scheduled for later this month. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April. The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China. In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries. This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff. China's latest remarks – released by the Commerce Ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions – echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict. They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as ""normal actions"" to safeguard national security and that of all nations. The spokesperson said that for ""a long time"", the US had ""overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures"" and ""adopted discriminatory practices against China"". ""Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,"" the spokesperson said. ""China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one."" Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing. This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones. The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks. It is unclear whether a meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn828kg8rmzo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ee2/live/d603cc70-a754-11f0-86ee-bde5491c9148.jpg,2025-10-12T10:25:31.645000+00:00,92a8170aaaccd1f595b095822f642b841f101953
c001de244842,Greater Anglia transfers to public ownership,,"Greater Anglia transfers to public ownership Greater Anglia Greater Anglia runs the key commuter service between Norwich and London Liverpool Street Greater Anglia has become the latest rail operator to enter into public ownership as part of the government's renationalisation of the network. The company runs trains from Cambridge, Ipswich, Norwich and Colchester to London, as well as Stansted Airport, Peterborough, Hertford and smaller lines. Its transfer on Sunday means half of all rail operators are publicly owned, which Greater Anglia described as another step towards a ""more unified"" network of Great British Railways. ""Passengers commuting into Norwich or heading for a day out in Cambridge will be travelling on services that are owned by the public, and run with their interests front of mind,"" said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. ""We're reforming a fragmented system and laying the foundations for a more reliable, efficient and accountable railway - one that puts passengers first and delivers the high standards they rightly expect."" Martin Giles/BBC Heidi Alexander visited Norwich railway station last week, ahead of the transfer Last week Greater Anglia, which handled 81.8 million passenger journeys in 2024-25, was named Rail Operator of the Year at the National Transport Awards. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the company, with government support, would continue to deliver regional growth. Two new stations are opening — Beaulieu Park in north Chelmsford this month and Cambridge South early next year — and the operator has a new fleet of bi-mode trains. Martin Giles/BBC Greater Anglia will eventually become part of Great British Railways Greater Anglia's managing director Martin Beable said the move was an ""exciting opportunity"" to build on its success. ""By working more closely with the wider family of publicly owned operators, we can share expertise, drive innovation, and deliver even better journeys for our passengers across the Anglia region,"" he added. ""This transition also brings us one step closer to Great British Railways - a simpler, more unified network that puts passengers at its heart. ""Together, we can create a railway that drives growth, sustainability, and pride for the communities we serve and right across the UK."" Greater Anglia joins c2c, Northern, TransPennine Express, Southeastern, LNER and South Western Railway, which are currently operated by DfT Operator Limited (DFTO) on behalf of the government. West Midlands Trains services will transfer back to the state on 1 February, followed by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on 31 May, with Chiltern Railways and Great Western Railways services expected to follow, the DfT said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36kg2lzjgno,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5d69/live/d6890e90-a73f-11f0-bcd6-45a56ab59606.jpg,2025-10-12T03:46:40.189000+00:00,f1e509a0c70edc6cab1ab92f1c844ea230379b72
1b27a2a115cd,I asked AI to plan my dream summer holiday. Here's how it turned out,,"I asked AI to plan my dream summer holiday. Here's how it turned out Alan Smith Alan Smith with his wife and their daughter's boyfriend on the pier at Castro Urdiales The gothic arches of Santa María de la Asunción crown the hill above the stone harbour where fishermen land their catches of sardines and anchovies. The church in Castro Urdiales, a small seaside town of about 30,000 people in northern Spain, is more than 700 years old. It was the perfect holiday destination for Alan Smith and his family, though he had never heard of it - until he asked ChatGPT. This week a report from the travel association ABTA found an increasing number of people were turning to AI to help with their holidays , from suggesting destinations to planning itineraries once there. Alan and his wife drove from their home in Kent to northern Spain with their caravan last month, where they met their daughter and her boyfriend. Alan had asked ChatGPT to recommend places in the area they could visit and requested the drives between them should not be too long. Castro Urdiales was one of the places suggested by the AI chatbot. ""It was the highlight of the holiday,"" Alan says, ""it was buzzing, like a smaller version of San Sebastián. Tim Graham/Getty Images The church of Santa María de la Asunción overlooks the fishing harbour of Castro Urdiales ""It had all the pintxos you could want, but it's smaller and has far fewer foreign tourists."" Alan is 62. According to the ABTA report, 3% of tourists his age use AI in some way to help with their holiday. The average for the whole population is 8% and use is highest among those aged 25-34, at 18%. After the AI chatbot made suggestions to Alan about places to visit and routes to take, he checked them on Google to make sure they were legitimate. He made all the bookings himself though, as he was not sure sure about ChatGPT's ability to do this - particularly given the sums of money involved. Alan began using the AI-powered tool shortly after it was released in November 2022 and uses it frequently for all sorts of things, from finding information about places he's visiting to recipes he wants to cook. He often turns to it instead of search engines to save time, rather than reading through several web pages such as travel blogs about good places to visit in northern Spain. ""I've been stunned at the results,"" Alan says. ""It's not always right though, and can - occasionally - be spectacularly wrong."" Alan Smith Alan says AI really helped when planning his family's caravan trip to Spain Hannah Read, 37, tried to use an AI chatbot to plan a trip to Norway with her partner and three children. She wanted to drive from her home in Flintshire, north Wales and cross the North Sea by ferry. ""I thought it might make for a nice drive,"" Hannah says. ""I asked ChatGPT if there was a ferry from the UK to Norway and it said there was one from Newcastle to Bergen."" She later checked a ferry travel website but found no such route exists. A travel blog detailing how Brits can reach Norway says the last time the route operated was in 2008. ""I did feel a bit disappointed when I found out the information on ChatGPT was incorrect, as I'd got quite excited and had started planning the trip in my head,"" Hannah adds. ""My advice is don't rely on AI 100%, it's better to still do proper research."" On ChatGPT's search section it reminds users to check important information as ChatGPT can make mistakes. David Harris David Harris and his family on Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center in New York David Harris, 46, used AI to help plan the itinerary for his family's first holiday in New York, but was more trusting about its recommendations. Unlike Alan, David knew where he wanted to go - and exactly how he was going to get there, unlike Hannah. But he wasn't sure how much he could fit into a trip of just four-and-a-half days, so he turned to an AI-powered tool for help. David asked it to suggest attractions to see and activities to do in the time they had - and asked for them to be grouped together by location so that he and his young family could walk between each. ""With four of us going we kind of wanted to see everything,"" David says, ""from Taylor Swift's house to the Ghostbusters museum."" Having used ChatGPT extensively for work and knowing attractions in New York tend to stay open quite late, he didn't feel the need to check the opening times and walking directions suggested by the AI chatbot. ""It took a couple of prompts to refine the itinerary - as it gave me a lot of information I didn't need to begin with - but it ended up producing a really good list of things to do."" David admits it hadn't even occurred to him to ask it to suggest possible flights with cheaper prices, but says he will try that for a holiday he is planning to the Mediterranean next year. David Harris The first day of the itinerary suggested to David by ChatGPT He adds: ""I think AI tools would help people so much if they understood how to use them and gave it a go."" They certainly have their place in holiday planning but users should understand how they work as well as check the recommendations they make, says Alistair Berry, a moderator on the UK Travel subreddit, an online forum where people can ask for advice about travel options in the UK. ""Sometimes these chatbots provide really poor advice,"" Alistair says. ""We get a lot of Americans, who get relatively few vacation days, on our site and they have these AI-made itineraries. ""ChatGPT has convinced them they can see London, Edinburgh and the Cotswolds in just four days and still have a good time. The reality is that they will probably spend most of the time looking out from inside a train."" He says people planning holidays with AI tools should understand their programming often makes them encouraging and affirming of the user's demands and requests. ""It definitely has a place in travel planning but you should fact check the suggestions it makes,"" says Alistair. ""After all, you don't want to be caught out when you're supposed to be having a relaxing time on holiday.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8w6kn2dyzo,business,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9e33/live/5b660dd0-a6bd-11f0-a5ba-c17536b4c2c1.jpg,2025-10-11T23:06:46.899000+00:00,1a4f92f36bcc4bb0ac84c60e18a58158bcdc5a9c
da0f701a68df,Trump directs Pentagon to 'use all available funds' to pay troops during shutdown,,"Donald Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to pay military personnel despite the federal government shutdown. The president said on Saturday that Hegseth must make sure troops do not miss out on their regular paycheque, scheduled for Wednesday. The directive comes as other government employees have already had some pay withheld and others are being laid off. ""I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The Republican and Democratic parties blame each other for failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government. Trump's message asks Hegseth to ""use all available funds to get our Troops PAID"" on 15 October, when military personnel would see their pay withheld for the first time since the shutdown began on 1 October. Many US military employees are considered ""essential"", meaning they must still show up for duty without pay. Some 750,000 other federal employees - about 40% - have been furloughed, or sent home, also without pay. Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen. ""The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,"" Trump posted on Saturday. Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government after nearly 12 days shut down, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people. Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage. Finding a way to pay for military salaries could help reduce some of the political risk  for congressional leaders if the shutdown drags on. In an effort to pressure Democrats, the Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown. ""The RIFs have begun,"" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for ""reductions in force"". The administration disclosed later on Friday that seven agencies had started firing more than 4,000 people, making good on the president's repeated threats to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce. The reductions included dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to the BBC's US partner CBS news, citing sources familiar with the situation. The agency's entire Washington DC office was laid off, the sources told CBS, adding that among the laid-off employees were those working on the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, the agency's Ebola response and immunisations. There were also reductions in the human resources department, they said. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, told CBS that the let-go workers were not essential, and that ""HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda"". Employees at the Treasury Department and in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security were also among those laid off on Friday, those agencies confirmed. The American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, two major unions representing federal workers, have filed a lawsuit in northern California, asking a judge to temporarily block the layoff orders. ""It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,"" AFGE president Everett Kelley said. A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning. ""These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,"" he said. ""More RIFs are coming."" In a court filing opposing the unions' request for a temporary restraining order, the justice department revealed that agencies such as the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency could also see staff cuts. The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would ""irreparably harm the government"". Are you a federal worker in the US?

e0adc8957ee3,Phillipson: Universities must tackle antisemitism,,"Universities must act to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campuses, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, as she set out measures to tackle antisemitism. Phillipson said there had been an ""unacceptable increase in antisemitism"" at universities and added that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe on campuses. She said the UK government was funding training to help staff and students at universities ""tackle this poison of antisemitism"". ""There can be no place for harassment and intimidation,"" Phillipson told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Universities can and must act on that."" Speaking on the programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the Labour government should be ""gripping"" antisemitism in the UK, including what she branded ""hate marches where people are being so racist to the Jewish community"". She argued ""hatred"" was demonstrated on the streets of London on Saturday, when thousands of protesters gathered for a rally in support of Palestinians. Ahead of the march, organisers had said they wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinian people. There have also been regular protests staged at universities over the conflict in Gaza, including on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel earlier this week. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part, warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". The demonstrations came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. A report by the Community Security Trust , a charity which provides security at sites like synagogues and Jewish schools, last year found a 117% increase in antisemitic incidents on university campuses in the 2022/23 and 2023/2024 academic years, when compared with the preceding two years. Phillipson said she had spoken to Jewish students who felt they needed to conceal their identity. ""On campus, Jewish students don't feel safe,"" she said. ""And often, parents worry about sending their children to university. We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it."" The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment. The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate. A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding. Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two. Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression. But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were ""ugly protests"" which demonstrated ""division and hatred"" in our society. ""Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,"" she said. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters. The director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign - one of the groups that organised the march - said the group would ""never stop"" supporting Palestinians. Ben Jamal said: ""This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country and around the world who want freedom and justice for Palestine."" During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza, slogans such as ""stop arming Israel"" and ""free Palestine"" could be seen.

541505e0ffe1,Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions,,"Badenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questions Joshua Nevett Political reporter and Harry Farley Political correspondent AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) both deny the accusation of spying for China Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to the prime minister asking him to address ""unanswered"" questions about the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - were dropped in September, prompting criticism from MPs. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said ministers were ""disappointed"" it had not proceeded. In her letter, Badenoch said the government's account of the situation had ""changed repeatedly"". Sir Keir Starmer previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China - which dubbed it an ""epoch-defining challenge"" - and his government has maintained it is ""frustrated"" the trial collapsed. Badenoch outlined ""several key questions which remain unanswered"" in her letter on Sunday, and asked that Starmer or a senior minister appear before MPs ""to clear things up once and for all"". She wrote: ""This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on Members of Parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security."" The letter queried remarks made by the Phillipson to the BBC earlier in the day, in which she said Starmer's national security advisor Jonathan Powell had no role in the ""substance or the evidence"" of the case. Phillipson also said ministers were ""deeply disappointed that the case hasn't proceeded"", and insisted the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was ""best placed to explain why it was not able to bring forward a prosecution"". The Conservatives had suggested Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it said it needed to secure convictions. Badenoch questioned Phillipson's comments: ""What does this mean? If he was ""not involved"" in the decision over months not to give the CPS what they needed, then who was?"" Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year The opposition leader also claimed the government - which had denied ministers were involved in the trial's collapse before the DPP claimed the necessary material had not been obtained - had sought to ""appease China"". She disputed Starmer's comments that ministers could only draw on the previous Conservative government's position, writing: ""As various leading lawyers have pointed out, this is not how the law works."" Starmer had told reporters earlier this week: ""You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence"". ""So all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then."" Badenoch asked that Starmer clarify whether any ministers knew about the government's interactions with the CPS in which it ""refused"" to provide the material being sought. She also asked if the matter had ever been raised with Starmer, including by Powell, and if an earlier denial of the government's involvement had been ""misleading"". The Conservatives have submitted an urgent question in Parliament, asking ministers to address MPs on Monday to explain why the trial collapsed. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC ministers ""must urgently explain why it chose not to disclose the reams of information it has demonstrating China was a threat to national security in the 2021-2023 period"". He said: ""It looks as if Jonathan Powell was behind this decision - and he should resign if he is."" Meanwhile, several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. They claim there is a document with ""hundreds"" of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. Sources cited the hack on the Ministry of Defence, which ministers suspected China was behind, as one of many incidents. ""I don't think there is a sane jury in the world that would look at that evidence and conclude China was not a threat,"" a source in the last government said. Former Conservative ministers also point to public statements, including from the former head of MI5 Ken McCallum, who in 2023 said there had been a ""sustained campaign"" of Chinese espionage on a ""pretty epic scale"". The Liberal Democrats said the government's approach to China was ""putting our national security at risk"". The party urged the government to block the planning application for a new Chinese embassy in London. ""Giving the green light to the super embassy being built in the heart of the City of London and above critical data connections would enable Chinese espionage on an industrial scale,"" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. However, last month the director of public prosecutions said ""the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test"".

A Met Police spokesperson said Mr Rowland was arrested on 6 October in relation to offences alleged to have taken place between June and October. He is due to appear again at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: ""We cannot provide any details at this time; Ed's number-one priority is the safety of his family.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77d702znm4o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9188/live/c3b1dca0-a76e-11f0-93e3-054bcb63bc18.jpg,2025-10-12T13:54:25.013000+00:00,6b9f21a593e5bdc2a74c7f4a779865a9d05bf6b0
b1f592f9c00a,Starmer arrives in Egypt ahead of summit on Gaza peace plan,,"The prime minister has arrived in Egypt ahead of an international peace summit where the peace plan for Gaza is due to be signed. Sir Keir Starmer will pay ""particular tribute"" to US President Donald Trump at the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh, Downing Street has said. A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated. The US president will lead Monday's summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for Sisi said. Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip. Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK had ""played a key role behind the scenes in shaping"" the Gaza peace plan. Britain had been involved in ""complex matters of diplomacy"", she told Sky News, without providing further detail. Appearing later on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson was asked to spell out the UK's role, and responded: ""We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that."" However, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, called Phillipson's comments ""delusional"". Posting on X, he added: ""She can thank [Trump] anytime just to set the record straight."" Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel further criticised the UK's claims on Sunday. Also appearing on Sky News, she was asked whether the UK had played a key role, and said the ""opposite"" was true. Haskel said decisions by the UK government - including the one last month to recognise Palestinian statehood - had ""actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position"". Monday's summit in Egypt will involve a ""signing ceremony"" for the peace plan, ""marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed"", Downing Street said. Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for ""bringing us to this point"" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure ""swift progress towards phase two"" of the truce. No 10 added in its statement: ""He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security."" French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will ""express his full support for the implementation of the agreement"". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to ""end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability"". Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt. He said: ""We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited."" Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a ""photo opportunity"" and the government has ""had no role whatsoever"" in the Gaza ceasefire. ""I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,"" she told Kuenssberg. The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt. The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qnqx7znqno,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d6b2/live/01ba3120-a7a4-11f0-80e5-35639bfcaf32.jpg,2025-10-12T19:58:24.092000+00:00,7862aa7f9f007c68d11416e89832ff9115ee9f20
912d73316427,Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs,,"Surge in Chagos arrivals prompts row over housing costs Joshua Nevett Political reporter Damien Dursonial handout Damien Dursonial (C) and his family were among the arrivals at Heathrow this week The UK government is facing calls to support Chagos Islanders who need temporary housing after a surge of them arrived in the country to claim their right to British citizenship. Hillingdon Council said 152 Chagossians had arrived at Heathrow Airport in the borough this week so far, bringing the total to over 600 since last July. The Tory-run council says it expects to spend £2m this year on its legal duty to help homeless British-Chagossians, putting pressure on stretched housing resources and ""breaking"" its finances. Many of the Chagossians are coming from Mauritius because they say they feel unsafe there after the UK government agreed a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to the country. The UK government said Chagossians were expected to make their own housing arrangements prior to travelling and argued the influx of arrivals was ""completely unrelated"" to the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius. The Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, then an overseas territory of the UK, was transformed into a military base in the 1960s and the entire population was forced to move out, mainly to Mauritius or the Seychelles. But in 2002, a limited number of Chagossians were granted the right to full British citizenship. Several thousand now live in the UK, incuding an expat population of 3,000 in Crawley, West Sussex Then in November 2022, the government launched a new British nationality route which was widened to all individuals of Chagossian descent, living anywhere in the world, permitting them to be recognised as British citizens free of charge. Adults have five years, from 23 November 2022, to claim British nationality. Children born within the five-year application time have until they are 23 to apply. This predated the the UK government's decision this year to sign a deal to hand ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base that was built on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands. The deal has not gone down well with many Chagossians, who see it as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland. Some fear they could be prosecuted by Mauritian authorities for supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Damien Dursonial, 35, landed at Heathrow with his wife and two children, aged four and six, on Wednesday this week. Born in Mauritius, where he worked as a police constable, Mr Dursonial saved up for two years and sold his motorcycle to pay for the flights to the UK. ""I came to the UK because it was the only place where we could feel safe, respected and recognised as a British citizen,"" Mr Dursonial said. ""As a Chagossian in Mauritius, we faced real threats by simply identifying as British or supporting UK sovereignty over the Chagos islands."" Mr Dursonial and his family have been placed in temporary accommodation by Hillingdon Council, in West London. But he said: ""The government should have done this because all this work is falling on a local council. ""It had to spend about £1.2m. Whereas ministers are giving away the Chagos Archipelago and taxpayer funds to Mauritius."" Steve Tuckwell says the cost of housing arrivals is ""breaking the council"" Hillingdon Council says it is at risk of going effectively bankrupt and has put in a request for exceptional financial support from the government. It is aiming to cut spending by £38m this year, the largest savings target the council has ever undertaken. ""It's breaking the council,"" Steve Tuckwell, the cabinet member for planning, housing and growth at the Conservative-run council, told the BBC. ""It's taking away hard-earned taxpayers' money from core services."" Tuckwell, a former Tory MP, said the council had written to ministers asking for funding to support Chagossians but had not received any responses. ""I'm calling on the government to do the right thing,"" Tuckwell said. ""Stop this burden on Hillingdon taxpayers. The bank account is running dry."" The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814 and became formally established as an overseas territory after the UK government bought the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. The islanders were evicted between 1967 and 1973 to create a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia. The global population of Chagossians is estimated to be about 10,000, with many of them living in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK. Vanessa Mandarin Calu, who works with Biot Citizen, said many British-Chagossians were temporarily settling in the UK while they wait to return to their homeland. ""Our homeland is a British Overseas Territory - the government should create a clear pathway for British-Chagossians instead of handing our territory to another country without consulting us,"" Ms Mandarin Calu said. Hillingdon Council opened a pop-up processing centre in the borough this week to deal with the surge in Chagossian arrivals. Local authorities have a legal duty to help eligible people who are homeless and provide temporary accommodation for families with dependents. As British citizens, people of Chagossian descent are entitled to the same support as any other homeless person with a UK passport. The council says it is already struggling to support asylum seekers placed in the borough by the Home Office. A government spokesperson said: ""Chagossians travelling to the United Kingdom are expected to arrange their own accommodation prior to arrival. ""Hillingdon Council has received funding to provide support in cases where immediate local pressures arise and cannot be resolved through standard contingency measures, with support for all local authorities kept under ongoing review. ""This is completely unrelated to the Diego Garcia Military Base agreement signed with Mauritius. ""In November 2022, the last government launched a route to British citizenship for the descendants of those born on the Chagos Archipelago. The Diego Garcia agreement has no impact on this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd721j8390zo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8370/live/76292040-a5d1-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-11T06:39:14.322000+00:00,f247100993cb8f1f9985d32d121f920e383535e3
8685f7036fb9,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term",,"Plaid promises independence plan, but not in first term David Deans Political reporter, BBC Wales News Matthew Horwood Rhun ap Iorwerth has been leader of Plaid since 2023 Plaid Cymru has promised to publish a plan for Welsh independence - but not within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party conference members endorsed leader Rhun ap Iorwerth's proposal to set up a ""standing commission"" to talk to the public about the future of the country. Members supported plans for the commission to prepare a white paper on Welsh independence, but ap Iorwerth told members that was not ""for the next government"". He did not give a date for when, but it suggests Plaid Cymru could pursue the idea if it won both the 2026 and 2030 Senedd elections. Ap Iorwerth used the conference in Swansea to present his party as a government in waiting, saying it was ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next vote in May. The party has already pulled back from its previous commitment to offer an independence referendum within five years, made at the last election in 2021 under former leader Adam Price. Ap Iorwerth ruled out a referendum in the first term of a Plaid-led government back in May . However, in Friday's conference speech he said the party would ""kick start the national debate on independence"". Plaid's annual conference on Saturday endorsed a motion that said Wales was ""on a journey to independence, and that enhancing devolution could form part of that journey"". It said a previous Welsh government-backed independent commission on Wales' future was a ""model for engaging people"" on constitutional issues, with the party's motion saying a standing commission should be set up to oversee the government commission's recommendations. Among other things, the government commission called for justice and policing powers to be given to the Welsh government, and for the full devolution of rail services – both decisions the UK government would need to take. Independence was a viable option for Wales' future, the commission had said, although it did not explicitly support it or any other option, with a caveat that independence meant ""hard choices in the short to medium term"". 'Formal path' The conference motion said the standing commission would engage ""citizens in an ongoing dialogue about constitutional issues"" and research ""issues of relevance to Wales' constitutional future"". It would also prepare a ""white paper on Welsh independence"". The motion also said that the power to hold a referendum should be devolved. A white paper is a document that details a government's plans or proposals. The SNP published a white paper on its independence plans ahead of the 2014 Scottish referendum, in its second term of government. BBC Wales was told the standing commission could begin gathering evidence for a white paper in a Plaid first term. Proposing the motion to the conference on Saturday, Ap Iorwerth said: ""The motion looks to the future... and the need ultimately for a white paper which would set the formal path towards asking the people of Wales in a referendum. ""We make it clear it is us that should call the referendum when the time is right. ""But that's not for now or the next government.

05cf2e4341fe,How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms,,"How John Swinney plans to put his stamp on the SNP as election looms Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor, Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney will make his keynote speech to the conference on Monday There is one sure sign that the Scottish National Party is about to meet for its annual conference. Around this time each year, there is always renewed emphasis on the goal of independence from the party's leadership. And right on cue, the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney published another Scottish government paper this week promising a ""fresh start"" for Scotland should it become an independent country. It's useful for the SNP leadership to show those gathering in Aberdeen for the party's 91st annual get-together that their primary cause has not been forgotten. In truth, the party is completely stuck on how to establish a viable route to Scottish statehood. That is a source of frustration to many in the SNP and should result in a lively debate on independence strategy at conference later. PA Media Swinney launched a new paper on independence this week Whatever is decided, there is unlikely to be any movement towards independence unless the SNP retains power at Holyrood. That looked to be in serious doubt a year ago when Labour swept to power at Westminster having comprehensively defeated the SNP in a national election for the first time in 14 years. Three things have changed since then. Swinney has stabilised the SNP, Labour's popularity has slumped and the rise of Reform UK appears to have widened the SNP's pathway to what would be an incredible fifth term in office. When John Swinney took over as first minister following the resignations in quick succession of Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf he inherited a party in turmoil. He has proved to be a steadying force. He quickly calmed controversies over gender identity, the environment and the police investigation into SNP finances which has led to the prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell. PA Media Swinney inherited a party in turmoil after the resignations of Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon If that was phase one of his leadership, phase two was to focus the Scottish government on priorities like improving public services. In short, to try to make a noticeable difference for the public. One ally of the first minister sums up this approach as ""stop digging, get delivering"". Swinney might highlight scrapping peak rail fares , signs of a reduction in child poverty and the decision to lift the two child limit on access to benefits (whether or not the UK government does the same) as examples of progress. The SNP's political opponents would point to persistent long waits on the NHS, cuts to college budgets and the emergency release of prisoners from overcrowded jails as evidence of failure. Among other challenges to be confronted by whoever is in charge, repeated warnings from financial watchdogs that levels of social spending in Scotland are unsustainable. There also appears to have been a decline in trust in the Scottish government to work in Scotland's best interests in recent years, according to the latest social attitudes survey for 2023 . All of this will feature in the pre-election arguments to come. Getty Images Labour's momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer walked into Number 10 Labour insists that Scotland can take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government with Anas Sarwar as first minister. Labour's trouble is that their 2024 momentum did not last long after Sir Keir Starmer stepped into Number 10. The unpopularity of the prime minister and the UK government seems to have dragged Scottish Labour down. Opinion polls suggest the SNP has a double digit lead over Labour, with Reform UK nipping at their heels, having pushed the Conservatives into fourth place. The SNP appears far less popular than it was five years ago and the rise of Reform UK seems to be fragmenting support for unionist parties. That could mean the principal party of Scottish independence is still well placed to overcome divided opposition in constituencies across the country and finish as the largest party nationwide. There is nothing definitive about these polls and seven months of campaigning could produce a different outcome. Remember that against widespread expectations, Labour beat the SNP in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election earlier this year. PA Media Labour would like to see Scotland take a ""new direction"" by ousting the SNP and ushering in a Labour-led government under Anas Sarwar The Tories hope their calls for cuts in public spending, regulation and taxation will distinguish them from their left-leaning rivals and help them persuade traditional supporters not to switch to Reform UK. While Nigel Farage's party has focused on reducing immigration and more oil and gas exploitation, these are both policy areas outwith Holyrood's control. One hope for the SNP's opponents is that they can rally anti-SNP support behind whichever party appears best placed to beat them in each local area. That has had limited success in the past. As independence is more popular than the SNP at the moment, part of Swinney's strategy will be to entice at least some lapsed SNP voters back. That will mean a bit more talk of independence - a cause for which Swinney has been campaigning since he was 15. With such political experience he will sense that to many within and beyond the SNP, independence seems like something of a political mirage at the moment. The UK Supreme Court has ruled that any future referendum would need the consent of the UK government and Sir Keir Starmer has made clear he has no intention of enabling a vote during his time in power. In a key conference debate on Saturday, Swinney will argue that the ""only uncontested route"" to another referendum is for the SNP to win an overall majority of seats in the Holyrood election next May. That was what persuaded then Prime Minister David Cameron to agree to the 2014 referendum - and the first minister thinks a similar outcome would force the current PM to budge. 'Mandate to deliver independence' Then there are those who think a more radical approach is required. That the SNP should treat the 2026 election as if it were a referendum. In other words, if independence supporting parties secure more than 50% of the votes in the Holyrood list ballot that should be considered as a ""mandate to deliver independence"". It's not clear what that means. Seeking to negotiate with the UK government? Unilaterally declaring independence and daring the UK to block it? Or something else? It is an approach that would not be regarded as legitimate by parties that favour continued union. The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK would reject it on the basis that elections are about so much more than the single issue of independence. This is a debate Swinney's team expect to win at conference. Their question is by how much? They will want it to be by the widest possible margin to avoid damaging his authority. One elected politician arguing the alternative case predicted a ""wee gem"" of a debate where the leadership would need to work harder than usual to get their way. Whether the SNP focus on trying to achieve a majority of votes for all independence supporting parties (including the Greens and Alba) or a majority of Holyrood seats for themselves, these are both very high bars to clear. The SNP also needs to be careful about pushing independence too hard. While it remains a popular policy with a large minority of voters it is not necessarily a priority for all those who support it. When asked to identify their key concerns in one recent survey, those asked identified the NHS, the cost of living and immigration as their top three. The Scottish government Swinney met Donald Trump in the Oval Office on his visit to the US So what else can we expect from this conference? It seems to me that Swinney has been working hard to develop an image for himself not just as a first minister but also as a potential statesman. Think meetings with Donald Trump in both Scotland and at the White House, statements at Holyrood on Ukraine and Gaza and a forthcoming visit to Africa. I imagine there will be some reference to Swinney's international engagement, not least because the newly recognised Palestinian ambassador to the UK is due to address conference. It's worth remembering that Swinney took over as first minister midway through a parliamentary term secured on a manifesto signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. Yes, they were close. He was her deputy in government. But this conference, particularly his keynote speech on Monday, is an opportunity for Swinney to put his own stamp on things. Expect him to set out more clearly who he is and what a Swinney government less bound by previous pledges would seek to do. There will obviously be continuity but perhaps some elements of change too. Will that be worthy of description as a third phase of his leadership? Let's see.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgknlj3vr76o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7eb1/live/3375c820-a68a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T08:17:58.053000+00:00,28a976ad43163114d6b79caddbf7d8a657f67f10

A memo written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft, dated 14 May 2002, briefs Sir Tony about ""super-rich"" financial adviser Epstein ahead of a meeting scheduled at 17.00 GMT that day. The meeting was six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002, and discussed US and UK politics. He never met or engaged with him subsequently."" He added: ""This was, of course, long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction."" Emails seen by BBC News show Lord Mandelson pushed for the meeting, telling Sir Tony's chief of staff Jonathan Powell that Epstein was ""a friend of mine"" who ex-US President Bill Clinton hoped to introduce to the PM. The release of this and several related documents had previously been blocked by government officials due to concerns about the impact on UK-US relations. The document has now been released by the National Archives under a Freedom of Information request, following the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador after fresh revelations about his friendship with the disgraced financier. In the email to Powell - the current UK government's national security adviser - Lord Mandelson refers to Epstein as ""safe"". The email on 7 May 2002 states: ""Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB? ""This was frustrated - TB said at the time - in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies. ""He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him."" The email continues: ""I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him. ""I have ascertained from Jeffrey that he is flexible - he could be here any time from Tuesday onwards to fit round the diary - but would obviously need to know reasonably quickly so as to re-schedule accordingly. Can you let me know?"" There are three separate handwritten notes on the print-out of the email, some of which are illegible, but one appears to read ""do you want to do this... Because you wanted to see Clinton by yourself... I know very little more about him"". At the time, Lord Mandelson was a backbench MP, having twice resigned from the cabinet, but still a force in Labour. Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein but said had no knowledge of his crimes. Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The National Archive has also released a schedule headed Trade and Industry Meetings with Industry, which includes a memo published on 14 May 2002, briefing Sir Tony about Epstein ahead of a meeting schedule for 17.00 GMT that day. The briefing, written by senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft is marked R, understood to mean restricted. In the memo, Rycroft, who until March 2025 was the permanent secretary at the Home Office, wrote to Blair: ""Jeffrey Epstein is seeing you at 5pm today. ""He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton and Peter Mandelson."" Rycroft states: ""The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York"". He adds: ""Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him. ""He thinks you would find worthwhile a conversation with him about a) science and b) international economic and monetary trends.""

65453694efa5,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper",,"No plans to send UK troops to monitor Gaza ceasefire, says Cooper Getty Images UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said there are ""no plans"" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire from Israel. The first phase of a deal with Hamas that will lead to a ceasefire and the release of hostages has been approved by Israel and has now come into effect, according to its military. Cooper, who is meeting foreign ministers in Paris, said the UK will continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza. ""This is still a fragile process but it is one there is a huge momentum behind and a huge commitment to, so we have to make it work,"" she said. The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to Israel to coordinate what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, according to US officials. This is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and to help coordinate humanitarian assistance. Forces from Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, will also be involved, helping to observe the truce and report any violations. US officials said that no American forces would enter Gaza. Asked on BBC Breakfast on Friday whether UK troops would be involved, Cooper said: ""That's not our plan, there's no plans to do that."" The foreign secretary was also asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent comments in an interview with Euronews, that Europe had ""essentially become irrelevant"" in ceasefire plans, and said the decision by countries, including the UK, to recognise a Palestinian state had been an ""ultimate reward (to) Islamists"". Cooper replied that the UK has had disagreements with Israel over this issue but that ""the point now is that we need countries coming together to make peace a reality and to actually make it happen"". She insisted that the UK has ""already contributed"" to get to this point in the peace process, including by putting forward proposals as part of a framework for peace and through the recognition of a Palestinian state. Cooper said that moving forward, the UK would be involved in talks with Arab states over ways to get financial investment into Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment. On Friday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to back ""substantive humanitarian aid packages"" during the ceasefire, along with the leaders of France and Germany. The leaders, known as the E3, said they ""stand ready to support further talks on the next stages of the plan and to contribute to it"". More than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel's military offensive according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly Israeli civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Sir Keir had previously emphasised the UK's role in peace negotiations, and said on Thursday that the country had ""played an important part behind the scenes"". Speaking at a press conference on a visit to Mumbai, he added that the UK now ""stands ready to play our part in implementing this [the peace plan], again with others, as we go forward"". Cooper flew to Paris on Thursday from Northern Ireland with her German counterpart. Both ministers had been attending a meeting of foreign ministers from the Western Balkans at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. She told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that they had held discussions about the lessons learned during the implementation of peace processes in their own countries in recent decades. ""What we know is that countries can come together to support peace, to resolve conflict, to rebuild nations,"" she said, and added that she believed the reflections could help in Gaza. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK must play a ""maximum role"" in maintaining the ceasefire.

688657a756e6,Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds,,"Government to consult on digital IDs for 13-year-olds Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter PA Media The government will consult on whether children aged between 13 and 16-years-old should be included in roll-out of planned digital IDs. The proposed UK-wide scheme will be introduced by 2029, and available to all UK citizens and legal residents but only mandatory in order to work. There has been a backlash to the scheme, with a petition attracting nearly three million signatures. But on Friday, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the plan, telling LBC ""lots of 13-year-olds already"" have digital IDs and that standardising the process would help. A spokesperson said the government ""need to consult"" on including children as young as 13, since many already work part-time. ""As we announced, it will be a legal requirement for employers to check someone's digital ID as part of Right to Work checks."" the government spokesperson added. ""Children can work part-time from the age of 14. In some local council areas this is from the age of 13."" Under the proposals, digital ID will be available for free to all UK citizens and legal residents. It will be mandatory only for those seeking employment, while remaining optional for students, pensioners and others not entering the workforce. Defending the plans to consider the inclusion of 13 to 16-year-olds in the scheme, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told LBC: ""Everybody has forms of digital ID... We all have different ways of having to prove who we are. ""Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward. ""I do think that this is the right way forward, to have this standardised process now, and it's something that we had been already setting out for people who come to work from abroad."" The UK petition opposing the IDs warns the scheme could lead to ""mass surveillance and digital control"". However, civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch branded the scheme ""Orwellian"" and urged MPs to reject plans. Director Silkie Carlo said: ""The prospects of enrolling even children into this sprawling biometric ID system is sinister, unjustified and prompts the chilling question of just what Starmer's government think the digital ID will be used for in the future. ""At a time when parents are taking a critical view of whether children should have smartphones, it is shocking that the government is considering enrolling children into this digital ID app."" The Liberal Democrats said the consultation on offering digital ID to 13-year-olds showed they had been right to warn about ""mission creep"". ""It is frankly sinister, unnecessary, and a clear step towards state overreach,"" said the party's science and technology spokesperson Victoria Collins. During a trip to India this week , Sir Keir praised the country's far more extensive Aadhaar digital ID system, which includes biometric data, as a ""massive success"". He suggested similar technology could be used in UK banking and public services. Downing Street later clarified his comments, stating the UK scheme would not necessarily replicate India's biometric model and would be run by the public sector. Other countries that already have digital ID systems include Estonia, Denmark and Spain, as well as Canada and Japan. The European Union is introducing the Digital Identity (eID) Wallet, which all member states will be required to roll out to citizens by the end of 2026.

Last month, Nathan Gill, pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019. Asked, by BBC Wales, if he questioned Gill over the statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it, all I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine."" ""I told him not to go, he defied me and went, I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill, who is no longer a Reform member, also used to be a politician in Cardiff Bay. He was one of seven UKIP politicians elected to the Senedd in 2016 when the party was led by Farage. Gill took money from Oleg Voloshyn, once described by the US government as a ""pawn"" of Russian secret services, and made pro-Russian speeches in the European Parliament, statements to a TV channel and arranged an event with a politician close to Moscow. Mr Voloshyn is a former member of the Ukrainian parliament for the pro-Russian Opposition Platform for Life party. Gill's activities emerged in WhatsApp messages on his phone after he was stopped at Manchester Airport on September 13 2021 under counter-terrorism laws. On a campaign visit, on Friday, for the upcoming Caerphilly Senedd by-election, Farage responded publicly for the first time to the Gill bribery case. ""I'd known this person for a very long time, I knew him in the European Parliament in the UKIP days to be a God-fearing Christian, somebody that you would think was the least corruptible person that you would know,"" he said. Asked if he knew about Gill making pro-Russian statements, Farage said: ""I didn't know anything about it."" ""All I knew was that he'd been to Ukraine. He said 'we're going on a visit to Ukraine, do you want to come?' ""I said 'you're off your rocker, this is one of the most corrupt countries in the world,  you must be mad'. And I told him not to go. ""He defied me and went. I was completely unaware of any statements that he made."" Gill served as a UKIP, and later Brexit Party, MEP between 2014 and 2020 and was leader of UKIP Wales between 2014 and 2016. He was leader of Reform UK Wales between March and May 2021, leading the party's Senedd/Welsh Parliament election campaign but is no longer in the party. Gill will be sentenced in November. His defence barrister has said he expects to be jailed. Nigel Farage campaigned alongside Nathan Gill (in red and white striped tie) in Caerphilly in 2019 for the European elections The Caerphilly Senedd by-election, prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August, takes place on 23 October.

e27347846934,"Universities risk sanctions over Gaza protests, watchdog says",,"Universities risk sanctions over Gaza protests, watchdog says Joshua Nevett Political reporter BBC Universities could face sanctions if pro-Palestinian protests descend into harassment and discrimination against Jewish students on campus, the free speech director at the watchdog for higher education in England has said. Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), told the BBC freedom of speech did not mean the freedom to intimidate, harass, and discriminate against Jewish students. He said he was concerned about antisemitism on campuses and warned universities the OfS was ""prepared to act"" if Jewish students were not protected. The regulator has the power to issue fines, cut off access to public funding and revoke the ability to award degrees if universities breach its rules. Mr Ahmed - who champions free speech on campuses in his role - spoke to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast following a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part , warning of ""rising antisemitism on our streets"". Sir Keir said it was ""un-British to have little respect for others"" by staging demonstrations on the anniversary and argued the protests had been used by some as a ""despicable excuse to attack British Jews"". Students from London universities took part in a joint march on 7 October, while rallies took place in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield. Protest group UCL Action For Palestine, which took part in the London march, posted on social media that it would not be ""silenced or intimidated"" and stood in solidarity with the thousands of Palestinians killed before and prior to October 2023. The protests came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. Security has been stepped up at synagogues across the country in response to the attack. In his interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said he was concerned about the protests on 7 October and antisemitism against Jewish students. ""Universities and colleges also have a duty to take steps to protect students from harassment and that includes antisemitic harassment,"" he said. ""And we in the OfS will be prepared to act if we think universities are not meeting those duties."" He said if there was ""unlawful support for proscribed organisations"" on campus ""then that's absolutely not something that freedom of speech protects and it is something that we would expect universities to address"". Universities and colleges must be registered with the OfS if they want certain benefits, including access to student loan funding. If universities are deemed to have breached the conditions of registration, they can be sanctioned by the OfS. In March this year, the University of Sussex was fined £585,000 by the OfS for failing to uphold freedom of speech . The OfS said the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to ""positively represent trans people"", could lead to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. Risk of political violence In an earlier interview with Political Thinking, Mr Ahmed said the assassination of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk was ""an appalling tragedy"" and warned democracy would not survive if differences could not be settled through speech. ""You must allow people to express their views on really controversial topics, because alternatively, there will be no alternative to violence,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""And that will be the abyss that we end up falling into."" Mr Ahmed also said the OfS was ""ready to act"" to punish universities for not protecting academics and students from harassment and intimidation from foreign dictatorships. Mr Ahmed said he had seen evidence of visiting foreign scholars threatening academics in the UK, whispering in their ears ""we're following you, we're watching you"". He said: ""If your business model involves breaking the law, if your business model involves unlawfully suppressing academic freedom and freedom of speech at the behest of a foreign dictatorship, then you need another business model."" Mr Ahmed said the OfS had powers to force universities to take action. ""We can remove their titles to universities. We can fine them. We can ultimately cut off their access to public funding.""

1b34a0470af4,Swinney: No 'shortcut' to NHS wait time reduction,,"Swinney: No 'shortcut' to NHS wait time reduction Glenn Campbell Scotland Political Editor and James Delaney BBC News John Swinney says the NHS waiting lists are being tackled but there is no shortcut John Swinney has said there is no ""shortcut"" to faster diagnosis and treatment in the NHS. In an interview with BBC Scotland News, the first minister accepted that ""some people have had to wait far too long"" for certain treatment. But he insisted the Scottish government was working to expand capacity and increase operations and that ""progress is being delivered"". The NHS is still working to recover from the Covid pandemic and, as of June, about one in nine people in Scotland is on an NHS waiting list. Speaking ahead of his party's annual conference in Aberdeen, Swinney also addressed the case of an eight-year-old girl with a serious condition who has been told to expect a 19 month wait for her surgery. The girl's mother has told BBC Scotland News the delay meant her daughter could not live a normal life due to her declining kidney function. The first minister said he could ""totally accept"" the worry and anxiety caused by these circumstances and offered to personally look in to the case. Swinney said the Scottish government was taking all the steps it can within its resources to ensure NHS performance matches the expectations of the public. The most recent Scottish social attitudes study covering the period up to 2023 found that 69% of those asked felt that NHS performance was getting worse. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine also claimed more than 800 deaths in Scotland last year were believed to be linked to long A&E waits. Swinney said: ""What we are doing, what we are focusing on, is about doing all we can to reduce waiting times and make sure more people are being treated and of course the most recent data shows, for example, is we've had record numbers of operations. ""We've had record numbers of hip and knee operations and these are some of the things people have had to wait quite a long time for. ""There is no shortcut. We need to make sure we get a flow of patients in to A&E, so they can get assessed quickly, so they are able to be released home. We have very high levels of patient discharge from hospital, we take all of these steps to make sure people receive care that they require."" 'Counterproductive and damaging' Swinney also said he wanted to avoid industrial action by hospital doctors who are to ballot for a strike. He said the Scottish government would ""work constructively"" with the British Medical Association (BMA) to resolve the dispute. He was also asked about immigration during the interview. Swinney said the UK debate was ""counterproductive and damaging"" and a ""positive approach"" was needed to help grow Scotland's working age population. He said we should ""embrace migration"" and that doing so was ""something we should be proud of"". Swinney said: ""I think we have to have a rational and considered debate about migration because I can't talk to a single business sector or area of activity in our country that doesn't tell me they are short of people. ""We have very low unemployment in Scotland today and our various sectors are short of people and we've got a working age population that is not large enough to support our economy and our activities. ""Scotland has always been a welcoming country, an inclusive country, that we bring people together, and that's the type of Scotland I want to live in.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr614l6ezlo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a5d8/live/e1563820-a5f5-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T16:27:00.511000+00:00,d36cc54e083018948dbb449a0387d7cdc806ba81
63e720077700,Plaid promises free childcare if it wins Senedd election,,"Plaid promises free childcare if it wins Senedd election David Deans Wales political reporter Rhun ap Iorwerth said that youngsters would get free childcare if his party wins power from Labour Families who have children aged nine months to four years old will get free childcare if Plaid Cymru wins the next Welsh Parliament election, its leader has said. Rhun ap Iorwerth made the pledge as he told conference delegates he was ready to lead the country ""right now"", replacing Labour as the party of government. Labour has led Wales since the start of devolution in 1999, and has dominated Welsh politics for a century. The next Senedd election takes place in May. He said the ""transformative"" policy, offering at least 20 hours for 48 weeks a year by 2031, would be a ""helping hand with the things that matter the most"". He told the conference in Swansea that ""Labour's time is up"" and that Reform wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain an ""electoral foothold"". Ap Iorwerth called on voters who wanted to stop Reform to back his party, accusing Nigel Farage of spurring a summer of ""simmering hatred"". On Friday he said the 2026 vote will not be an independence election - but said it would ""kick-start"" the debate about whether Wales should go it alone. Currently help with childcare costs is only available to families whose parents are in work, education or training, or to very young children who live in a Flying Start area. Families whose parents are in work, training or education who has less than £100,000 a year in income would still get 30 hours a week for three to four-year-olds, as they do now. Some eligible two-year-olds qualify for 12.5 hours of care a week under Flying Start, but it is not available nationally. Plaid's plan would also allow ineligible families to claim 20 hours a week for three to four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year, and all families 20 hours for nine-month-olds to two years. The party says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Rhun ap Iorwerth was met with a standing ovation as he closed his speech in Braygwyn Hall Ap Iorwerth told BBC Wales: ""This can make a huge difference. It's a very, very important step in terms of helping families with the cost of living. ""This is universal, which marks it out from the system in England."" The Welsh government has been under pressure to match childcare provision in England, where children between nine months and two years of working parents receive free child care. The Bevan Foundation has said that high costs were pushing more families into poverty and out of work . Plaid's plan would be in three stages. It is proposing to keep the existing 30 hour offer for three to four-year-olds, while extending the roll out of 12.5 hours a week for two-year-olds. The next step would be to give 20 hours to parents of three and four-year-olds who are not currently eligible for any help. The party would then try each year to increase the number of hours offered to children under the age of two. It would be rolled out over the life of the next Welsh Parliament, with the policy fully implemented in the 2030/31 financial year. The party says that by the end of the five-year roll out it will spend roughly an extra £500m a year on childcare - bringing the total cost to £800m. It says it can find the cash from the Welsh government's budget, with about £400m thought to be available in the next budget if other services increase by inflation. Ap Iorwerth said it was ""money that we know we can afford"". Getty Images Plaid Cymru says the policy would be worth £32,500 to families for the first four years of their child's life Party sources, asked why parents whose incomes are above £100,000 should get free childcare, said services that are delivered universally are better, and that households across demographics are struggling. Plaid says it would be the most generous childcare care offer in the UK. 'Plaything' Ap Iorwerth, a former BBC Wales broadcaster, announced the policy in a speech where he set his party stall as a government-in-waiting. He called on his party to seize the ""historic opportunity ahead"" and turn it into ""reality"". Plaid Cymru has played a key role during the life of devolution, being an occasional supporter of Labour governments since 1999. It has been unable to beat Labour in an election - but recent opinion polling has suggested Plaid is vying with the party to win, as is Reform. The Member of the Senedd for Ynys Môn told the conference hall that Labour had forgotten ""where it came from who it was there to serve"". He said the UK had faced a summer of ""simmering hatred"", spurred on, he said, by Nigel Farage. ""Farage and his followers drive the deliberate fragmentation of society, giving life to the bogeyman without whom they are nothing."" He said Reform UK wanted to treat the Senedd as a ""plaything"" to gain ""an electoral foothold"". 'New leadership' Ap Iorwerth said Plaid was ready to govern ""right now"", promising to ""usher in an age of new leadership that will set Wales on a different path."" ""We are not here as Labour's conscious, we are not here to repair Labour, we are here to replace them,"" he said. The party leader promised an ""immediate cash injection"" into the NHS to prioritise the longest waits. He warned that Reform threatened the health service with ""US-style bills"", and vowed to keep the NHS free at point of need. Matthew Horwood/Plaid Cymru Ap Iorwerth was elected the new leader of Plaid Cymru in 2023 Ap Iorwerth was greeted with cheers and applause throughout the speech, and was given a standing ovation after he called on those who have ""never voted for Plaid Cymru before, the time is now"". ""The time is now to stop Reform and elect a government more radical, more ambitious, more impatient to bring about positive change."" He said his government would be on the side of ""young and old, urban and rural, north and south, Welsh speaker, non Welsh-speaker"". The party has traditionally been stronger in its Welsh-speaking heartlands of north and west Wales. Plaid Cymru promised a referendum on independence at the last election in 2021 - but is not now. Earlier Ap Iorwerth told Radio Wales Breakfast the 2026 election would not be about independence for Plaid. ""There's no referendum... in the next few years,"" he said. But in his speech he said the party ""will kick start the national debate on independence"", building on the work of the previous commission on Wales' constitutional future by setting up a permanent commission. ""It's not just about aspiration, it's about creating the best chance to build a modern nation of good health, opportunity, prosperity, and fairness,"" he said. Analysis Rhun ap Iorwerth is hoping to be Wales' first non-Labour first minister - judging by the reaction in the hall, his members think he can. Plaid Cymru conferences can be business like affairs but there was a definite change in the atmosphere in Swansea - not a city in the party's usual heartland of north and west Wales - with a speech that was well received in Brangwyn Hall. It is not proposing wholescale shake up of public services - the party leader thinks that's too risky in the current climate - but says it offers ""radical"" plans such as a payment to tackle child poverty . Labour's woes have given the party the best chance it has ever had to lead Wales but Plaid faces some challenges. If Plaid came first it is possible they would have to work with Labour or other parties in some form, with no party having ever won a majority in the Senedd. It is also hoping to bring people who have never voted for Plaid into the fold, in the hope they are motivated by wanting to stop Reform. The party has to convince voters they are the best option to do that, while the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour say similar things. They also face a Reform party that has Wales set in its sights - a party with greater resources, something Plaid has struggled with in the past.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewnv2xprzko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6900/live/0eb52e40-a5f9-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T16:38:28.234000+00:00,45ecccb5cad00a89125121d6430285bb6ecd7efa

Fayaz Khan, 26, posted a video last October where he named the Reform UK leader and made a gun gesture with his hand. The jury went out at 12:54 BST on Wednesday before returning its verdict at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Khan had a ""very large presence online"" with his videos on TikTok under the username ""madapasa"", amassing hundreds of thousands of views. PA Media Reform UK leader Nigel Farage went to Southwark Crown Court to give evidence during Khan's trial Prosecutor Peter Ratliff said Khan's videos showed his attempts to come to the UK by small boat from Afghanistan. On 12 October, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube titled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"" which highlighted Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". Mr Ratliff said Khan responded with a video on 14 October, which was played to the jury, in which Khan addressed the Reform UK MP as ""Englishman Nigel"". The video continued: ""You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me. ""Don't talk about me more. Delete the video. ""I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop."" Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said ""pop, pop, pop"" he had made ""gun gestures"" with his hand and headbutted the camera. 'Pretty chilling' Khan, an Afghan migrant, had also pointed towards an AK-47 tattoo on his face to ""emphasise he wasn't joking"". The prosecutor added: ""If you've got an AK-47 tattooed on your arm and your face, it's because you love AK-47s and you want the world to know that."" Farage, the MP for Clacton in Essex, gave evidence on Tuesday and said Khan's video was ""pretty chilling"", adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" The Reform UK leader added: ""He says he's coming to England and he's going to shoot me."" Jurors were shown other videos posted on social media by Khan in which he appeared to make ""pop, pop, pop"" noises and similar hand gestures to those in the TikTok video referencing Farage. Metropolitan Police Khan came to the UK on a small boat last year from Afghanistan Khan was not called to give evidence on Wednesday by defence lawyer Charles Royle, but in a police interview last year he had said: ""It was never my intention to kill him or anything. ""This is my character, this is how I act in my videos."" Khan said: ""In every video I make those sounds, I say 'pop, pop pop'."" Jurors were also shown a screenshot of a subsequent TikTok post by Khan with the caption ""I mean what I say"" written on an image of a GB News report about the alleged threat against Farage. In the prosecution's closing speech, Mr Ratliff said the alleged threat to kill was ""not some off-the-cuff comment"" and the video was ""sinister and menacing"". He added that Khan was ""a dangerous man with an interest in firearms"". In his closing defence speech, Mr Royle said Khan was ""remonstrating in his own idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic, eye-catching, attention-seeking way"", rather than making a threat to kill.

Nine people were removed on Thursday, in addition to a group of 10 last week, the government said. Previous removals have involved smaller numbers of people. It takes the number returned to France under the deal to 26, while the UK has accepted 18 in return. Ministers hope the scheme will deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally in small boats by threatening removal to France, with properly vetted asylum seekers accepted in return. But on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed 1,075 migrants crossed the Channel the previous day. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the recent return of larger groups would send a ""clear message"" to ""think twice"" about travelling to the UK illegally. ""We must put an end to these dangerous crossings which put lives at risk and money in the pockets of criminal gangs,"" Mahmood said. Thursday's flight saw a regular deportation flight bound for Eastern Europe diverted to France to offload nine people. The Home Office said more flights are scheduled to take place ""over the coming days and weeks"". The first removal under the UK-France deal was carried out in September, with the scheme set to run until June 2026. More than 33,500 people have crossed the Channe l in small boats since the start of 2025.

East Wiltshire MP Danny Kruger became the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to the party last month and has now written to his 71,000-strong electorate to explain why. He explained he had ""jumped ship"" because of what he claimed were Tory ""failures"" on issues such as mass migration and Brexit, which he believes led to a loss of confidence in the party. The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment on Mr Kruger's claims. Mr Kruger said his former party was ""rightly and naturally punished for its record"" at the 2024 election in the letter, which was sent to every constituency household. He said: ""I was elected in 2019 to 'get Brexit done' and then – as Boris always stressed – to move beyond Brexit and fix the underlying problems with our country. ""We did the Brexit bit, but then we failed. Most of all, we failed to control our borders and reduce taxes as we had promised. ""Many of our communities have experienced huge and unwelcome change due to mass migration."" He further described his unhappiness at the armed forces being ""hollowed out"", the ""highly precarious"" nature of the economy, and said public services were ""at the brink of collapse"", despite spending increases. Following his defection, Mr Kruger was criticised for not calling a by-election by both the leader of the Conservatives on Wiltshire Council, Richard Clewer, and Melksham and Devizes Conservative Association chair Brian Burchfield. Mr Burchfield said Mr Kruger's constituents ""deserve the opportunity to choose their Member of Parliament based on the party they stood for at election – not one they've opted to switch to mid-term"".

The two leaders met to discuss ways to expand business and trade links after they signed a landmark trade deal in July . Sir Keir's two-day visit to India's financial capital involved the UK's  largest-ever trade delegation of more than 100 CEOs, entrepreneurs, university vice-chancellors and cultural leaders. Among the other issues discussed by the two prime ministers was the war in Ukraine, as India continues to buy Russian fossil fuels, helping to fund Vladimir Putin's war effort. Sir Keir described the trade deal as ""huge"" for the UK and ""the most ambitious trade deal India has ever done"". Speaking at a press conference, he said: ""This trade deal is a launchpad to boost British leadership in everything from tech, to life sciences, to renewable energy and much more beyond that... ""The opportunity is clear - Just look at the sheer scale of India, the world's largest democracy on track to become the third-largest economy by 2028."" In their meeting, the PM said the pair discussed the need for ""a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, the need for stability and security in the Indo-Pacific, and the need to co-operate in critical areas like climate and energy, including breaking away from dependence on fossil fuels"". Asked whether he raised the issue of India buying Russian oil, Sir Keir told journalists: ""Yes, we did discuss that this morning with President Modi, and we each went through the steps we're taking to bring about a resolution of the conflict."" Modi has described himself as a friend of Putin, but suggested he wanted to see the Ukraine war come to an end through ""dialogue and diplomacy"". Sir Keir said he also raised the case of Jagtar Singh Johal , a British Sikh activist who has been held in an Indian prison for seven years without a conviction. WPA Pool/Getty Images Thousands of photos of Sir Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi line streets in Mumbai Arriving in India, the prime minister was given a rousing welcome, with thousands of giant photos of him and Modi lining the streets in Mumbai. On Thursday Sir Keir announced more UK universities would be opening campuses in India, which the government said would bring a £50m boost to the economy. Confirming that the University of Lancaster and the University of Surrey had been given approval for new campuses, he said: ""I'm delighted that more Indian students will be able to benefit from a world-class British education in the near future – strengthening the ties between our two countries while pumping millions back into our economy and supporting jobs at home."" The UK has a growing network of international campuses in India, with the University of York, University of Aberdeen and Queen's University Belfast among those expected to open campuses from as early as next year. On his first day, Sir Keir met the founder of India's digital ID system - Nandan Nilekani - in the wake of plans to introduce a digital ID for people working in the UK. The government's plan to introduce compulsory digital ID for people to prove their right to work in the UK has seen more than 2.8 million people signing a petition against the idea. But Downing Street is determined to press on, claiming it will curb the ability of migrants to work illegally. The government says the yet-to-be-implemented UK-India trade deal has already led to £1bn of investment and almost 7,000 jobs being created in the UK. Under the deal the UK will cut taxes on goods imported from India including clothing, footwear, jewellery and frozen seafood, while India will reduce duties on the import of Scotch whisky, cosmetics, medical devices and luxury cars.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdj66llg9go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46b6/live/0cd29c00-a4cf-11f0-b9e2-5ff3a1edd7bf.jpg,2025-10-09T14:44:04.198000+00:00,ff8972547f5f79b43722ed535698da96ccf9e748
3934ae44d85f,Liberal Democrat membership has halved in 5 years,,"Liberal Democrat membership has halved in 5 years Helen Catt Political correspondent Getty Images The number of Liberal Democrat party members has almost halved in the last five years, according to BBC analysis of available figures. The figure has fallen from just under 118,000 in 2020, when Sir Ed Davey became leader, to 60,000. That is despite the Lib Dems having their most successful general election ever last year in terms of seats won. A party spokesperson said ""in actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats"". It comes as the Green Party of England and Wales says it now has 90,000 members, a 91% increase on 2020 figures. The Liberal Democrats saw a significant boost in membership in the run-up to Brexit in 2020, when the party was campaigning for a second referendum. The drop in paid-up members since then has been masked by the inclusion of ""registered supporters"" in figures published in the party's annual accounts each year since 2017. Registered supporters sign up for free to get access to briefings and events, but they cannot decide policy or vote in leadership elections. The party clearly states the figure published in the annual accounts relates to both member and supporters. However, it does not provide a breakdown. 'Public profile' Prof Tim Bale leads the Party Membership Project, a joint project between Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University. He said the drop in membership was surprising given the Lib Dems' electoral success, which would suggest ""a party on the up, in which case you might get more ambitious people wanting to join it"". But he added: ""There's an extent to which surges into parties are prompted by public profile... and they don't seem to have much chance of getting into government at the moment."" In more positive news for the Lib Dems, he said research carried out by his project after the 2024 election showed that the Liberal Democrats were the most active of all the memberships of the political parties. Figures collected showed that a greater proportion of Lib Dem members (19%) had canvassed voters face-to-face or over the phone than any other party. Prof Bale said there was ""all sorts of research over time that, certainly in very close races, contact with the voters, whether that be face to face or just leafletting does seem to make a difference"". A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""We have a record number of MPs, the most popular party leader in the country, and elected more councillors than Labour or the Conservatives for the first time ever in May's local elections. ""When it comes to actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats as the only party that can stop Reform turning Trump's America into Farage's Britain."" Other parties Working out how many members a political party has can be tricky. There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, so they tend to only be revealed in annual accounts or when a party holds a leadership election. Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen a drop in membership of 37% since 2020. Latest published figures put its membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, although reports have suggested it may have fallen further to 309,000. An updated figure should be given by Labour later this month, when the winner of its deputy leadership contest is announced. Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has just under 260,000 members. The Green Party of England and Wales has seen a rapid surge in membership and now says its has 90,000 members, which is a 54% rise on last year's figure of 58,322 in December. The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures, but 131,680 people were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election, which is 40,000 fewer than in the 2022 contest. Party membership figures are not verified by outside bodies. Where we got our figures The figure that has been most recently used for the current size of the Lib Dems is 83,174, which was the figure for December 2024 that appears in the party's annual accounts, including both members and registered supporters. As the freelance journalist Adam Ramsay has pointed out, the figure for paid-up members is given elsewhere, in a statement for the party treasurer in the accounts for the Liberal Democrats in England . It says there was an ""overall membership of 60K"", with 55,000 - or 92% of them - in England, and supporter levels that ""remain constant at over 20K"". To get the membership figure for 2020, we looked to the number of ballot papers issued in the leadership election, as only full members can vote. At the time, the party said it had issued 117,924, papers, which was its highest ever number.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5069p70x2o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fa8/live/4ac8fe20-a45f-11f0-a789-358ea6d9d143.png,2025-10-09T01:13:34.391000+00:00,686e1a8729e5033c76cfd3d7c632471b9b52762f

Caroline Clapper, who sits on both Hertfordshire County and Hertsmere Borough councils, said a by-election would incur ""a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer"". Fellow defector Brett Rosehill said other councillors had switched parties and this was the first time demands had been made for a by-election. Clapper also said there was no precedent for a poll being called following a politician's move to a different party. Steve Fraser Steve Fraser, a Hertsmere voter, says councillors who change party should resign and contest a by-election Steve Fraser, who lives in Potters Bar, said: ""When our councillors decide to change parties part way through their term of office, they should resign so that an election is held. ""Most people intend their vote for a party in the election, rather than for the particular person standing. ""So, if someone decides to change party part way through their term it's only fair that they should resign and, if they like, stand again in their new colours."" On social media, Carol Ripley said: ""Sorry but this is just not fair on voters who elected this councillor."" In the county council elections earlier this year, Clapper received 67% of the vote for the Conservatives in Watling ward. The Reform UK candidate in the same ward came second with just 16%, but that result may not necessarily be replicated in a by-election.

""There is no precedent for councillors standing down and calling a by-election after changing party affiliation, and such a move would incur a significant and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.""

526905a3ce11,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces",,"Conservatives would scrap stamp duty, Badenoch announces Brian Wheeler Political reporter Standing ovation as Badenoch says Tories would scrap stamp duty The next Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes, Kemi Badenoch has said, in a surprise announcement at the end of her first conference speech as party leader. Badenoch received a standing ovation from Tory activists in Manchester as she declared: ""That is how we will help achieve the dream of home ownership for millions."" She said scrapping stamp duty - a tax paid by home buyers in England and Northern Ireland - will ""unlock a fairer and more aspirational society"" and help people of all ages. It came after a speech packed with new policies aimed at grabbing political attention and setting out clear dividing lines with her opponents. Badenoch was under pressure to deliver the speech of her political career, to end speculation that she will face a leadership challenge, as her party continues to trail Labour and Reform UK in the polls. Her 45-minute address was peppered with jokes and personal stories and went down well in the hall, where - in contrast to some of the other speeches this week - there was standing room only. And in a clear break with the leaders' speeches at the Labour and Liberal Democrat conferences, she only mentioned Reform twice. Instead, she concentrated her fire on Labour, accusing Sir Keir Starmer of leading a  ""weak and directionless"" government, which was making ""one hell of a mess"" of the country. Her announcement on stamp duty was kept under wraps until she delivered it, telling the Tory faithful: ""Stamp duty is a bad tax. ""We must free up our housing market, because a society where no-one can afford to buy or move is a society where social mobility is dead."" 'Golden rule' Stamp duty is paid by people buying homes in England and Northern Ireland for more than £125,000 - but first time buyers are exempt from it on properties worth up to £300,000. Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reported to be considering scrapping stamp duty at her Budget in November, although Badenoch claimed it would be significantly increased. Under the Tory plans, stamp duty would be abolished entirely on ""primary residences"". The tax would continue to be charged on additional properties, properties purchased by companies, or by non-UK residents. The Scottish and Welsh arms of the party have confirmed that they would replicate the cut if elected in Scotland and Wales, where taxes similar to stamp duty apply to property purchases. The Conservatives said they had ""cautiously"" estimated that abolishing stamp duty on main homes after 2029 would cost the Treasury £9bn a year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the direct cost of the cut might be around £10.5-11bn a year by that point, with additional costs in Scotland and Wales taken into account. But researchers at the think tank added the estimated cost given by the Tories was not ""unreasonably low"", given uncertainty over how house purchases and property prices could evolve in the coming years. Badenoch insisted she could meet this promise with the money to come from £47bn in planned savings the party announced earlier this week, from cuts to the welfare budget, foreign aid, and Civil Service. The Conservative leader has promised that in office, her party would ensure half of all savings would be put towards reducing the deficit, the gap between government spending and tax revenues. Badenoch said the pledge would be a ""golden rule"" of any future Tory government, as she tries to rebuild credibility on the economy and present her party as the only one that will responsibly manage the public finances. In her conference speech, Badenoch claimed the Conservative Party was ""fizzing with ideas"" to fix the ""broken model"" she said was holding the country back. She pledged to scrap a string of government policies - from new employment rights to VAT on private school fees. And she ran through some of the big policy announcements the party has made this week, including: Her promise to end the ""family farm tax"" got a big cheer in the hall, and her proposals to slash welfare spending and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights also went down well. In a sustained attack on the Labour government, she said: ""All they have delivered is a doom loop of higher taxes, weaker borders, and month after month of chaos. ""They had a plan to win, but no plan for power. ""No vision for Britain. They know how to make promises, but not how to deliver them."" Acknowledging the Conservatives' dire opinion poll ratings and recent local election losses, she said voters were ""still angry"" with her party. And in a swipe at Reform, she said this had led to ""parties that in normal times would never be seen as a serious option for government are gaining ground, making promises they will never be able to keep"". But the speech was chiefly aimed at emphasising that the Conservative Party is under new leadership - one that was prepared to make the ""bold"" and ""tough"" decisions that her opponents would not.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20zv94ldpko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3560/live/3eedd230-a444-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-08T18:50:53.146000+00:00,2eb6148260cca3329dba90ec2845408cb1f94215

Reform UK has deleted social media posts after receiving a legal letter from the Labour Party. Addressed to Llŷr Powell, Reform UK's by-election candidate, the letter accused Reform of using copyrighted images in its material for the Caerphilly by-election. On 7 October, Labour gave the party 24 hours to remove an image featuring the first minister and candidate Richard Tunnicliffe, warning that failure to do so could lead to legal proceedings. Reform UK confirmed the posts have since been removed from its social media accounts. The move follows a row last week, when Reform UK sent its own legal letter to Welsh Labour , citing the Defamation Act 2013 and the Representation of the People Act 1983. The letter came after online posts appeared to link candidate Llŷr Powell to Russian president Vladimir Putin - an accusation the party strongly denies. Reform also objected to references that suggested former Reform Wales leader Nathan Gill had taken bribes. Last month, the 52-year-old from Llangefni, Anglesey, admitted eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019.

9c41a7feac6d,Would leaving the ECHR really 'stop the boats'?,,"Would leaving the ECHR really 'stop the boats'? Dominic Casciani Home and Legal Correspondent BBC Last week Kemi Badenoch announced that the Conservative Party would take the UK out of the European Convention of Human Rights if they won the next election. ""I have not come to this decision lightly,"" the Tory leader said. ""But it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens."" Her words came on the eve of the party's annual conference, at a time when the Conservatives are under enormous pressure from Reform UK. Nigel Farage's party also wants out of the ECHR, as well as other international treaties that he thinks stand in the way of curbing illegal immigration. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, meanwhile, has been just as strident the other way. ""Kemi Badenoch has chosen to back Nigel Farage and join Vladimir Putin,"" he declared - adding ""this will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system"". EPA Kemi Badenoch pledged to pull out if the Conservatives win the election, but there are many unanswered questions about the consequences Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has weighed in, though he hovers somewhere in between. He told the BBC he does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing how international law is interpreted to stop unsuccessful asylum seekers blocking their deportation. But while strongly-worded opinions over whether or not to pull out of the treaty make for easy headlines, the consequences are deeply complicated. Even Badenoch acknowledged last year that leaving would not be a ""silver bullet"" for tackling immigration. So how is it that such a nuanced issue has been reduced to a political hot potato? Dodging political bullets It was back in 2011 - not far into David Cameron's tenure as prime minister - that this issue came to the forefront of domestic politics. It centred around the case of John Hirst, a man convicted of manslaughter, who argued the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting in any circumstances was a breach of human rights. In 2005 Strasbourg had ruled in his favour. It essentially said the UK's policy was too black and white. Cameron's Labour predecessors Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dodged the political bullet of being seen to give in to the court. But when the relatively new Tory PM said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote, his soundbite propelled the ECHR to the heart of public consciousness. Getty Images David Cameron said he felt ""physically ill"" at the prospect of giving jailed criminals the vote The ECHR had been largely drafted by a British team and aimed to impose on post-fascist Europe a ""never-again"" package of legal rights. Its content drew heavily on historic laws - for example the concept of Habeas Corpus (banning unlawful detention), can be seen in the ECHR's Article 5. Officially, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights. And when it rules that a country is in breach, the member states come together to find a way of fixing the problem in the Council of Europe (nothing to do with the EU). But in the UK, there is also the Human Rights Act, which means ECHR cases can be dealt with by its own judges. Disputes between UK courts and Strasbourg can be worked through too - what happened following the John Hirst case is testament to this. In 2017, ministers allowed offenders who had been released on licence the right to vote - but made clear that Parliament would never allow votes for criminals still in prison cells. The Council of Europe closed the case. And just weeks ago the Strasbourg court threw out a fresh attempt by a prisoner to re-open the issue. Yet it was the original clash, together with Cameron's comments in 2011, that stuck in many minds. PA Media Starmer does not want to ""tear down"" human rights laws, but backs changing certain aspects around how international law is interpreted Adding fuel to the fire that same year, Theresa May - home secretary at the time - shared a story during party conference about a Bolivian man who avoided deportation because of his pet cat. This illustrated the problem with human rights laws, she argued. Only the story, as May told it, wasn't entirely correct , according to England's top judges. The Home Office indeed wanted to send the man home as an illegal immigrant. And the cat - called Maya - had featured in the man's appeal. But that was only a tiny part of the detailed evidence he provided. A spokesperson for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said at the time that the cat was ""nothing to do with"" the eventual judgement, which allowed the man to stay. Yet the pet became a source of unintentional humour - and when a judge cracked a joke about the cat no longer needing to fear adapting to Bolivian mice, the case took on a life of its own. By that autumn, a mood had begun to take hold about human rights that, 14 years later, has culminated in the Conservatives pledging to leave the ECHR. 'Open-ended and obscure obligations' Richard Ekins KC is a law professor at the University of Oxford and his thinking on “judicial power” for the Policy Exchange think tank has been hugely influential on the right of British politics. He is a staunch critic of the ECHR on the basis that membership in his view compromises UK sovereignty. ""But there is a more fundamental problem,"" he argues. ""And the fundamental problem can be observed by paying attention to what the court has been doing, which really is quite openly to expand the Convention's reach over time."" He references a case last year, where the court ruled that Switzerland had breached human rights by failing to tackle climate change. The incredibly complex judgement was celebrated by campaigners as a game-changer - but a British judge, Tim Eicke KC, said the majority on the panel had ""gone beyond what it is legitimate and permissible for this court to do"". Getty Images The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg polices those rights set out in the convention ""The judgment… imposes very far reaching, but also open ended and obscure obligations on member states,"" argues Prof Ekins. ""Domestic courts are going to be invited to apply the European Court's new approach to discipline, supervise [and] control climate policy, which obviously is a highly complicated and tangled set of considerations that intersect with social policy, economic policy, foreign policy."" This is the heart of his argument: a court completely divorced from the political will of the British people is now making the UK do things that are far beyond its original remit. ""It's incompatible - its intention at least - with parliamentary democracy,"" he argues. Hijacked by the immigration debate Nowhere is the allegation of overreach stronger in British politics than in Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system. Yet the evidence supporting this claim is often anecdotal and complex - as was the case with Maya the cat. A study of media stories about the ECHR by the University of Oxford's Bonavero Institute for Human Rights found that fewer than 1% of all foreign criminals who have appealed against their deportation in the UK have won their case on human rights grounds. When cases went as far as Strasbourg, the court tended to throw them out. PA Media Reform's claim that the ECHR is to blame for problems with the UK's migration system is based on evidence that is often anecdotal and complex That's not to say there are no issues at all. Lord Jonathan Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, believes that some decisions by immigration tribunal judges have become ""extravagant"" and far removed from the original boundaries of the right to family life. ""I have no problem about the text of the Convention,"" he says. ""I do have a problem about the unlimited expansion which it's undergone at the hands of the Strasbourg Court. ""It's unfortunate that the whole issue has been hijacked by the question of immigration. ""I think that it will make some difference to the ability to keep people out or deport them if we are not members of the ECHR. But I think the extent that it will make a difference is not widely understood - and has been greatly exaggerated."" Would leaving 'stop the boats'? So, would leaving the ECHR really ""stop the boats"", to use Rishi Sunak's phrase? ""The number one problem about deporting illegal immigrants, first of all, is finding a place which will take them and which is not unsafe,"" argues Lord Sumption. ""And secondly, [there is] the Refugee Convention. It doesn't require us to take in asylum seekers. It does require us to adjudicate on their claims and give them certain rights once they've got here, even if they got here illegally. ""The ECHR is certainly an additional difficulty, but not as great a difficulty, as is suggested."" Getty Images Lord Sumption: 'I think the extent that [it would] make a difference has been greatly exaggerated' The UK government has already promised to devise clearer and stricter rules that will tell immigration officials and judges how to interpret the right to family life. ""I think it is a runner,"" argues Sir Jonathan Jones, who was the Treasury Solicitor until 2020. This, he believes, could be the best way forward - particularly around the definition of the ECHR's Article 8, which guarantees the right to, among other things, family life. ""It's legitimate for the government to say we will take a tighter view, as a proper, reasoned, good faith attempt to rein in what we think Article 8 covers and what it doesn't."" But Alex Chalk, the last Conservative Lord Chancellor before Labour won power, argues that the UK government needs to seek reform faster. ""The ECHR is not holy writ,"" he told the BBC during the Conservative party conference. ""This government should be moving much more quickly to seek urgent reform. [It] should have been saying, look, we want to lead on this to do this in six weeks. ""The US Constitution was drafted in 15 weeks or so. This really can be done."" 'Rights are going to suffer' Human rights lawyer Harriet Wistrich is concerned about what could be lost if the UK does leave the ECHR. It has, she argues, been at the forefront of challenging the state's treatment of victims of awful abuses. ""We were able to hold Greater Manchester Police accountable on behalf of Rochdale grooming gang victims through civil [damages] proceedings. ""The Hillsborough inquests were possible by having Article 2 [the right to life] inquiries into deaths, where you want to examine what went wrong and what the state could have done differently. ""If we withdraw fully… it's those rights that are going to suffer,"" says Ms Wistrich, who is also the founder of the Centre for Women's Justice. EPA In May, nine nations called for ECHR reform over migration law. Their open letter - which the UK did not sign - called for states to have greater freedom over who to kick out Beyond legal battles at home, there are big international questions too around leaving. The 1998 Belfast Agreement, the cornerstone of peace in Northern Ireland, and the post-Brexit deal with the European Union placed respect for human rights law at their centre. Critics of withdrawing from the EHCR predict both could come crashing down. But Professor Ekins believes that you can have human rights safeguards without a supranational court overseeing all nations. He and colleagues wrote a detailed proposal on Northern Ireland that argue the historic arrangements don't require the UK to remain in the ECHR, providing it honours human rights and cross-community power-sharing arrangements by other means. James Manning/PA Wire Leaving the ECHR 'will do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system,' Sir Ed Davey argued The issues in Northern Ireland and the Republic could, however, go deeper. Sir Jonathan Jones for one is sceptical about how leaving the ECHR would go down in both places - because the ECHR's role in the agreement was to demonstrate to a lot of people who do not trust the British state that there are laws in place to protect them. Without it, whoever has a majority in the Commons would be able to do whatever they wanted, thanks to the ""winner takes all"" reality of how our constitution works. ""The thing about the Convention is that it constrains governments, and it constrains the way that governments can treat minorities and people it doesn't like,"" he says. ""If we were out of the ECHR, you wouldn't have that constraint."" Alex Chalk warns there could be an international price to leaving, too. There is value, he says, in sitting at the Council of Europe and raising issues with French and German counterparts at international conferences. ""You should try to reform before you yank your way out because inevitably there could be cost to doing so,"" he argues. But ultimately, he adds, ""this is a matter of politics more than it is of law"".

074254cd4834,Bleak reality of opposition sets in for Conservatives,,"Before us, there is a battalion of unemployed chairs. For the Conservatives right now, the fight even to be listened to is not easy. The speech by the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride is one of the big set-piece moments of this conference. And yet there were countless empty seats in a modestly sized hall. Next door, in the exhibition centre, there are swathes of empty blue carpet. Some of the fringe events exploring the party's future have been standing room only. But not in the main hall. This party, so often and for so long the dominating force in British politics, is a shrivelled version of its usual self. They have not had a conference like this in more than a quarter of a century. Granted, they were in opposition this time last year too. But many attendees then will have signed up before they knew about that – the general election could have come after it. Plus, 12 months ago, there was a survivors' elation vibe about their proceedings: a leadership election was underway and members of any political party tend to revel in a battle of ideas and personalities, almost whatever the circumstances. This year, the bleak reality of opposition has set in. Even back in 1998, a year and a bit into their last big stint in opposition, they were the principal voice in opposition to a big majority government. Not so now. A year and a bit on from a cataclysmic election defeat, the Tories have become more unpopular. It is Reform UK that have momentum, a sustained lead in the opinion polls and a recent track record of election victories, albeit a very long way away from a general election. In the weeks prior to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester, there has been a steady drip drip of former Tories joining Nigel Farage, some with the parting rhetorical gift of claiming their old party is finished. It is not an entirely downcast mood here though. Perhaps by definition those who have turned up are still up for the scrap ahead. The party has decided to embark on a blitz of policy announcements, after a year in which they have endured a recession in attention amid the boom in interest in Reform. What they want you to notice is their pitch to be seen as economically credible. They want to shrink the state by around £50bn by cutting benefits, cutting foreign aid and cutting the civil service. Most of that money saved would be spent paying down the deficit, but some would go on eye-catching policies like scrapping business rates in England and helping young people save to buy a home . Yet the ghost of Liz Truss lingers: despite their best efforts to politely disown her, the Conservatives' opponents will probably never lose their appetite for reminding voters of the calamity of her brief premiership . And for Kemi Badenoch, the challenge is being noticed – and persuading her party to keep her in her job. Her rivals, Sir Keir Starmer, Reform leader Nigel Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have all been around for longer and are all likely better known. Filling those empty chairs, commanding attention is just the beginning of the task she confronts. Has there ever been a tougher time in modern history for the Conservative Party? I'm not sure there has.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ne9yz37go,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ea50/live/b06730f0-a2d2-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-06T16:25:19.948000+00:00,bcb9d3ab92f89df1475051214b94c462e3bfe026
32ea352a35d5,Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future,,"Why time matters for Tory MPs deciding Kemi Badenoch's future Matt Chorley 5 Live presenter PA Media Louis Armstrong had all of it in the world. The Beautiful South needed a little more. For Kemi Badenoch, and her 118 MPs, time is also on their minds. The Conservative leader believes she needs more time, to turn around her party from its historic drubbing in last year's general election. Yet as time's gone on, she's gone further down in the polls. ""I didn't say it would be easy,"" she told Tory members on Sunday. ""And I didn't say it would be quick."" For her MPs - and I've contacted almost all of them for my BBC Radio 5 Live show via text and WhatsApp over the last few days - time is of the essence, and for some, it is already running out. Around one in three Tory MPs responded to my questions about the mood of the party, and the pressure Badenoch is under. They break down roughly into two camps. In the first are those who think the next election is a considerable way off and want Badenoch to be given space to try to repair damage not all of her own making. The mood, they insist, is better than much of the media speculation. ""Chipper"", even. They take comfort from Labour's own woes and leadership speculation, and cling to a belief that Reform UK's populist policies increasingly do not survive contact with reality. ""There's a gallows humour about the party, a 'well it can't get any worse, can it?' strange jovialness which is kind of bonding,"" says one Tory MP. Several texts I received suggested Badenoch had bought herself more time in office, perhaps months, with a single performance at Prime Minister's Questions last month , when she challenged Keir Starmer over what he knew about the friendship between his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. One former cabinet minister said: ""The Mandelson PMQs was a turning point. She smashed it. ""That one half hour has probably bought her another six months of grace in the job. She doesn't need to learn the same lesson twice. Giving her time and space is starting to pay dividends."" And then there is the second camp who think the clock is ticking: on her leadership and on the long-term viability of what used to be called the world's oldest and most successful political party. They grumble, especially those elected for the first time last year, about a leader's office lacking in direction, fight, even a willingness to acknowledge their existence. ""It's not that we're not getting listened to as a party,"" says one 2024 Tory MP. ""It's that we've nothing to say. We're too timid, we think we're in government still and are fretting about costing things that we'll never have to worry about if we keep on launching commissions and our best pushback against Reform is 'That's not costed, you know'."" In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches. When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied ""oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in"". Some tell me privately that the looming date of 2 November, when Badenoch will have been in office for a year and therefore open to a confidence vote, is ""focusing minds"" in the leader's office. ""She needs to have a very impactful conference in order to stave off a confidence vote before the end of the year in my view,"" says one MP. ""There's a whiff of fatality in the air because of the polls."" So how much time does she have? Next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd and many English councils are shaping up to be ""the moment of truth"", according to some of her MPs. (Labour MPs were saying similar things to me about Keir Starmer last week.) One member of Badenoch's own frontbench, who closely monitors the mood of the party, texts me bluntly: ""She is under unbelievable pressure. This will be her last conference as leader."" When I expressed some surprise at the prediction, the MP quickly responded: ""I like Kemi and I think we should stick with the leader we have so I hope I'm completely wrong."" Others are more convinced that her time is running out. One Conservative who publicly backed Badenoch in last year's leadership contest told me: ""Kemi's time as leader could end by Christmas rather than after the May elections. ""Ultimately unpredictable, and how conference goes will shape the outcome, but conference, and post conference polls, are undoubtedly pivotal."" Whatever the merits of having someone different in charge – and many see Robert Jenrick waiting in the wings – it risks exposing the Tories once again to the most damaging of political forces: ridicule. One grandee tells me: ""We need to regain our senses and remember we were totally thrashed last summer and have not yet been forgiven. More shenanigans won't help."" A shadow minister agrees: ""This conference is super important. People and members want direction and messaging and so this is Kemi's moment. She can't squander it - she needs to show why we are the sensible option on the right and a genuine force still. ""If she doesn't deliver it could be curtains but most MPs I speak to want this to work. There is too much PTSD from the last five years."" A former cabinet minister says: ""The Tories will start to make progress - and it will be on the economy – after enough time has passed since our crushing defeat and the public feel enough water under the bridge since that defeat."" Another says: ""When the country is ready to listen to us again (a year hence maybe?), we'll show that we are totally unified, have some great people and the right ideas."" One MP who has been in the Commons for two decades says: ""No one is expecting instant miracles nor is there urgent appetite for a coup."" PA Media Kemi Badenoch defeated rivals Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat in the 2024 leadership election in Birmingham Some note that she is very much the new kid on the block: Farage has been an elected politician on and off for more than quarter of a century. Starmer has been leader for almost six years. Even Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was a minister in the coalition government 15 years ago. Being unknown means voters struggle to work out what she is about, but it also presents an opportunity to move beyond the last Tory government and appear new and fresh. Talk continues about what to do about Reform. Will some sort of deal have to be made? A merger? A pact? A takeover? Whatever, the Tories need to be in a stronger position before it can think about such a negotiation. There is also a theory that's taken hold in Conservative thinking that part of their predicament is the fault of Keir Starmer. ""Usually the opposition would have longer but the government collapse in popularity has happened so quickly it has sharpened focus on needing to have an alternative narrative,"" one Tory MP, first elected in 2024, said. ""It is hard to look like a renewed party though when so many of the key people are well known from the last government when it was comprehensively dumped from power."" Some declare her party conference pledge to repeal the Climate Change Act a ""gamechanger"". Others say the same of a promise to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not always clear is if they actually expect it to change the game, or merely hope it might. Badenoch and her team are being urged to ""quickly set out a bold, uncompromisingly honest, radical 'Maggie 2.0' program of reform, on tax, small business, immigration and welfare, to tackle the grievances Farage is feeding on"". EPA Three display cabinets at Conservative party conference holding outfits worn by Margaret Thatcher Ah yes, Maggie. Margaret Thatcher. She would have turned 100 this month, but the former prime minister still haunts this conference and this party. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who took over as leader of the Conservatives after their 2001 election defeat before being ousted two years later, told me: ""I think it's a very difficult time for anyone to be leader. ""The Conservative party has a messiah complex, thinking some messiah will suddenly appear and lead us to the promised land. ""They look back to Margaret Thatcher and think she arrived as a fully-formed messiah to save the party and the country. In fact, when she arrived some people thought 'this is a disaster'. People said she was shrill, weak, difficult. It took her time for her strength of character and intellect to dominate and for her to become the leader she was. ""Kemi has that capability and needs time too. Otherwise we risk confirming people's view of us from our behaviour during the last government that we are fratricidal and not to be trusted."" In the conference exhibition hall in Manchester there is a lot of Thatcher merchandise - and a glass display case holding the burgundy wool suit she wore on the day she left Downing Street - a monument to the moment a female Tory leader was ousted by her colleagues because they believed she was doing more harm than good. After this conference week in Manchester we might have a clearer idea if Tory MPs are ready to do that particular Time Warp again.

43c9596e4810,The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire,,"The battle for Scotland's flag: Why the right has adopted the saltire James Cook Scotland editor Getty Images Something has shifted in Scotland. The saltire, which was long embraced by supporters of Scottish independence, has now been unfurled for a different cause. Up and down the land, the blue and white of St Andrew is fluttering from lampposts and being waved alongside the union flag at anti-immigration protests. Until recently those two standards were more often seen on different sides of the debate about Scotland's future. Now the saltire's presence is generating controversy of its own at demonstrations from Perth to Aberdeen and from Glasgow to Falkirk, where the latest rally was held on Wednesday evening. This battle for Scotland's flag is also a battle about what it means to be a patriot in modern Scotland - a battle of competing nationalisms. Steven Rennie addresses a rally outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall Steven Rennie is one of the prominent figures in these recent protests. He blends opposition to independence and immigration with sharp criticism of the Scottish National Party - which is in favour of both. I stood within a few feet of Mr Rennie as he addressed hundreds of supporters in the centre of Glasgow in late September. With his shoulders wrapped in the red, white and blue of the union flag, he spoke of the saltire. ""They claimed our national flag as their own and for 12 long years we've allowed them to wield it as a weapon of division and hate. ""But no more. We have reclaimed our flag, our identity, our pride and also our resolve,"" he said. Those on opposing sides of the debate have made their feelings known at protests The crowd - separated from hundreds of counter-protesters by a line of police officers - cheered the denunciation of the SNP whose leaders, in a referendum 11 years ago , failed to persuade a majority of Scottish voters to opt to leave the UK. ""The SNP has wreaked havoc on our nation, dismantling our prosperity and our potential at every turn, replacing us with new Scots and putting our own people at the bottom of the pile,"" said Mr Rennie. ""New Scots"" is a welcoming term used by Scottish government ministers who are keen to attract more foreign workers to help grow an economy which is challenged by a record low birth rate . The SNP has run the devolved government in Edinburgh since 2007 but immigration remains the responsibility of the UK government in London - and it has rejected calls for a separate Scottish visa system . Getty Images There was a counter-protest to the demonstration on Falkirk in August Migration is a thorn in the side for Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and appears to be rising up the agenda ahead of the Scottish parliamentary elections next spring. The small boats crisis and the accommodation of asylum seekers in hotels , which Sir Keir has promised to phase out, have fuelled demonstrations around the UK. That includes protests in Falkirk, where a building which was once a three-star hotel is being used to house migrants. One protester, who gave his name as Mark, held a union flag emblazoned with ""Stop the Boats"". He said politicians should be fixing ailing public services, not spending taxpayers' money on medical and dental care for asylum seekers. Mark was one of the protesters in Falkirk ""We're sick of these people rolling up in boats, getting four-star hotels,"" he told me. ""They're getting their three meals a day while Britain's services suffer. We're just sick of it and Starmer is not doing enough to try and stop it."" Minutes earlier one of the speakers had shouted: ""Keep Britain white. Keep Scotland white. Keep Scotland Scottish."" Mark insisted the man did not speak for him, and that the protest was ""nothing to do with racism"". Outside the hotel a group of counter-protesters, including many trade unionists, had gathered. They too were critical of the prime minister – but for different reasons. They accused him of pandering to the far right. Getty Images Counter-protesters demonstrated against a rally protesting about immigration in Glasgow earlier this month The two camps appear to share a sense of disgust about the UK's ailing economy and the poor state of public services - although they do not necessarily agree on the causes or the solutions. ""The real issue in our society is the people in government who aren't tackling these issues head on, not people fleeing persecution trying to find a better place to live,"" said a counter protester in Falkirk, who gave her name as Sage. Referring to the anti-asylum seeker protest across the road, she said: ""I don't blame these people for falling for these narratives, because everyone is suffering. ""It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum we're on, everyone is going through it."" The real problem, insisted Sage, was billionaires making record profits and not paying enough tax. ""We know who is underfunding our services. It's not migrants and refugees,"" she said. One recurring complaint among protesters is about the number of migrants being housed at local authority expense. The issue is most acute in Glasgow, which has the UK's highest number of refugees in council accommodation. Asylum seekers are housed by the UK Home Office but, after they are granted leave to remain and become refugees, that support quickly expires. At that point, many become homeless and, because Scottish councils have a statutory duty to house all homeless people, they must step in. ""Essentially, we have run out of temporary accommodation,"" said Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken. ""We don't have anywhere to put all of these people who are now declaring themselves homeless in the city, and we're having to put them up in hotels, and that's very, very expensive."" Getty Images Protesters in Falkirk said they were opposed to housing asylum seekers in the town The SNP councillor for Langside wants the UK government to step in but is at pains to stress that refugees do not have priority over anyone else. Aitken added: ""Anyone who is telling you that asylum seekers and refugees are prioritised by the SNP, by the Scottish government, or by this council is lying to you. It is simply not true."" Still, some hostility to immigrants persists and migration has risen up the list of Scottish voters' concerns as flags have appeared on lampposts around the country. Hundreds of saltires have gone up in working class communities such as those in north and east Glasgow; Sighthill in Edinburgh; and Falkirk's Westfield. Shawn, a refugee who lives in north Glasgow, believes the saltire usually represents peace, harmony and inclusion - but says it is now being flown ""for the far-right and racism"". The former police officer and his mother Mala successfully sought asylum in the UK after they fled their South East Asian homeland in circumstances they asked not to discuss in public for their own safety. Shawn said he had experienced racism on the streets of Glasgow Shawn, who runs a community organisation called the Springburn Unity Network, said he had been subjected to racist insults in Glasgow and knew immigrants who were afraid to leave their homes because of the recent protests. Debates about flags are not just raging in Scotland's big cities and working class towns. In the prosperous Renfrewshire village of Bridge of Weir, the hoisting of saltires has led to a row on the local Facebook group. In the middle of the village, Dougie Moore told me he approved of the flags because they sent a message to immigrants that ""they should be coming to enjoy our country the way that we enjoy it rather than changing things"". Bunty Singh, who owns a local café and delicatessen, said he had no issue with anyone flying a national flag but also insisted there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir. ""It's a peaceful, lovely village,"" insisted Mr Singh who was born in Glasgow to parents who were originally from India. ""We're happy to be here and we are welcomed here."" Bunty Singh said there were no problems with immigration in Bridge of Weir But at a local community hub Ian Gillies was concerned about the saltires, which he regarded as unwelcoming and divisive. ""I think it's in keeping with the spirit of the age,"" he said. ""'Every man for himself and we don't want anybody else coming our way.' I see the same trend in the States and elsewhere in the continent. It's sad to see it coming here."" Mr Gillies is not the only person to note an Americanisation of politics on this side of the Atlantic in the age of Donald Trump and social media. At the protest in Glasgow where Steven Rennie spoke about the saltire, there were chants, calls and placards in support of right-wing American influencer Charlie Kirk, who had been shot dead days earlier. Later the crowd chanted ""Oh Tommy, Tommy"", in tribute to the convicted criminal and far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , who uses the name Tommy Robinson and has been supported by Elon Musk. Getty Images There were tributes to the late right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk at a demonstration in Glasgow Matthew Feldman, a visiting professor at Liverpool Hope University and leading expert on the radical right, said he was concerned that extremism was bleeding into mainstream political debate because overt racism and the glorification of terrorism were ""being given a pass"" on US-owned social media platforms. At the anti-migrant protest in Falkirk, one banner referenced former SNP first minister Humza Yousaf's calls for greater ethnic diversity in Scottish public life in a speech which had been highlighted and criticised by Musk and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The same banner went on to quote a white supremacist slogan known as the 14 Words: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" ""The 14 Words actually comes from the eighth chapter of Mein Kampf,"" explained Prof Feldman. He said the slogan was ""a translation of Hitler's sense of Aryan supremacy"" and was popularised in the US in the 1980s by the late white supremacist David Lane. ""It is inconceivable to me that somebody that is writing out that phrase doesn't associate it with white supremacism and, more importantly, with a sort of an anti or racist view towards ethnic and religious minorities,"" added Prof Feldman. Getty Images One banner at a protest in Falkirk contained a white supremacist slogan It was not the only extreme language on display in Falkirk. Another sign read ""Kill 'Em All. Let God Sort 'Em Out,"" a phrase originally associated with a 13th Century Catholic crusade. While not defending the placards, many of the protesters we spoke to insisted they had genuine concerns about the safety of women and children. They pointed to the conviction of an Afghan asylum seeker for raping a 15-year-girl in the town and the arrest of a resident of the asylum hotel on sexual indecency charges, which he denies. Farage has also suggested sexual assault by asylum seekers is a particular problem, a claim described by Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken as one of history's oldest and nastiest racist slurs. When I spoke to Farage on a visit to Aberdeen earlier this year he insisted that Reform UK was now a serious contender in Scottish politics. ""I've spent a year going around England campaigning ahead of the English local elections, and perceptions of me and the party have changed over that last year, and I intend to make that happen in Scotland over the next year,"" he told me. That claim may be bolstered by Reform's strong third place in June's Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election , which Labour won. On Wednesday, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said arguments about immigration were being ""fanned by a wider debate"" going on in the UK and around the globe. The SNP leader told me he believed in a Scotland that was ""tolerant, welcoming and inclusive"" and urged people ""to avoid us being swept down a route of a relentless rightward direction in the United Kingdom"". Swinney added: ""I don't think that's where Scotland wants to be. I don't think that's how Scotland feels. And I want to make sure that people in Scotland realise that there is a danger that we will be carried down that route if we don't take a different course."" Polls ahead of May's Holyrood election suggest a big lead for the SNP, with Reform potentially overtaking the Conservatives to challenge Labour for second place, despite never before having won a seat at Holyrood. Whatever flags are waved by whichever party in the campaign, immigration appears likely to take its place alongside the economy and public services as a big issue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxqknx7jqo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe18/live/e1266390-a44a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T05:23:41.120000+00:00,f00d9d17665b7a7e2ee6de315db240aad28103dd
e598dc3621ee,Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power?,,"Can Polanski's Greens turn momentum into power? Sam Francis Political reporter Getty Images In the month since self-proclaimed ""eco-populist"" Zack Polanski took charge of the Green Party of England and Wales, there has been a noticeable change within the party. With over 20,000 new members in recent months, the Green Party is the largest it has ever been. The party appears to be trying to shed its image as well-meaning eco-warriors to become an insurgent force. While there appears to be momentum within the party, in a splintered political landscape there is a question mark over how the Greens can turn this into votes. When campaigning to become Green Party leader, Polanski promised to ""pick fights"". On the eve of his first conference as leader, Polanski was argumentative during an interview on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme when pushed to defend his deputy Mothin Ali over inflammatory comments he had made about an Israeli army reservist. This willingness to create controversy - if it wins attention and cuts through to the public - has been embraced by his party. Boldness is needed to combat voter disillusionment and rising right-wing populism, argues Rachel Millward, Polanski's other deputy co-leader. ""I guess I can't see the point of not going as big as you can go,"" says Millward. ""If we stay timid, we might gain nothing. ""Whereas, if we're bold we definitely gain people because it resonates because it's true and it's real and people are craving that honesty."" The Green Party's head of elections, Chris Williams, oversaw the Greens' best-ever general election campaign last year - it gave the party four MPs for the first time by tailoring and targeting campaigns in both Tory and Labour heartlands. But he is now recalibrating the party's approach to reflects Polanski's leadership style. ""To tailor an old adage: if you try to annoy nobody you don't excite anybody,"" is how he puts it. The Green Party see on opportunity to build on the momentum. With increased belief comes more members, more donations ""the campaigns get bigger, and the targets grow, and we win more seats, and we just build upwards and keep on going"", Williams argues. The UK's shifting electoral landscape, is also bringing growing opportunity, Williams says. ""By-elections are being won with just 27% of the vote. ""The swings we need are smaller - instead of climbing Everest, we're having to climb Snowdon now in order to win a constituency."" The party has already picked a raft of so-called ""development constituencies"" in Tory and Labour held areas across the country, though the targets are predominantly urban where traditional parties like Labour and the Conservatives are shedding votes fastest, Williams says. Some members warn a shift away from localised strategy could risk alienating the very voters who delivered the breakthrough wins in 2024. The party's two current MPs in rural areas could be particularly exposed - ex-leader Adrian Ramsay in Waveney Valley, on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk, and Ellie Chowns in North Herefordshire. Ramsay and Chowns also ran on a joint ticket against Polanski, picking up just 16% of the vote. On the ground, Millward - who co-leads the predominantly rural Wealden District Council - insists the countryside vote is not at risk. ""We've had more new members coming in, even in our rural area,"" Millward says. Getty Images Zack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward (l-r) are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction. For all their ideological differences, the Green Party is watching Reform UK as a case study in how to win attention and turn it into electoral support. A well-attended panel discussion on ""how to stop Reform"" at conference was notable for the number of members praising the work of the Green's foe Nigel Farage. Members argued for copying a playbook of simple messaging, emotional appeal and a willingness to provoke - albeit with different content. In his leader's speech, Polanski said: ""If Reform can rocket through the polls with a politics of despair, then it's time for the Green Party to do the same thing with a politics of hope."" But the Green Party's electoral strategy is being reshaped not just by the rise of Reform UK. There's a risk that Your Party, the emerging political force led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could take the wind out of the Green Party's sails. At 82,000 members the Green Party is the biggest it has ever been. For context Your Party claims to have had more than 600,000 sign-ups in the weeks after it launched. For Millward, all this proves is ""Labour's lost its support on the left"". ""And we are actually gaining from that as well - so it's not like a net loss to us."" The Greens have long relied on grassroots energy and volunteer labour. They now have more members to call on, but for a party trying to scale up from protest politics to serious electoral force money matters. Behind the scenes, Millward and others are pushing for a bolder approach to fundraising. She used her conference speech to argue they will be the party of ""fivers"" – emulating the micro-donations successes of US figures like Barak Obama and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The party also needs to become ""bold enough to ask"" sympathetic donors that have sustained big parties like the Conservatives, Labour and Reform, she says. ""We're not talking about being funded by corruptive billionaires, but there are people who are with us and who would like a change."" The 2026 local elections will be a key test for the Greens. The party is aiming to hold a record 900 council seats when they contest a series of nominal strongholds, in London, Brighton and Huddersfield. The party is also talking up their chances in taking over new combined authority contests in Sussex, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Wales, they have high hopes the new proportional representation voting system will allow the party to gain a foothold in the Senedd. But fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral system in England and Wales can lead to unpredictable results. It is clear the Green Party leadership see a path to victory. Although some in the party argue that losing the ability to appeal to more conservative areas risks deepening divides, just when many voters want calm and competence, others view it as the price to be paid. What the party must now see is if voters will reward ""picking fights"" with electoral success - or a bloody nose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx85q4dyzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/193b/live/d6d4a950-a167-11f0-8b70-39bf68f49b3e.jpg,2025-10-05T13:15:26.026000+00:00,13abb7877500137130af79d8f04a8d9e24427f96
e7bc4c86a145,Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates,,"Meet the Caerphilly by-election candidates Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle Eight politicians are competing in, arguably, the most interesting by-election in the 26-years of Welsh devolution. They are seeking to represent the constituency of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament. Prompted by the sudden death of Labour Senedd member Hefin David in August , the poll takes place on 23 October. Here you can read about all of the candidates, in alphabetical order, and their messages to voters. The details were provided by the political parties and candidates, and reflect their views. Steve Aicheler - Welsh Liberal Democrats Welsh Liberal Democrats Who is he? Steve Aicheler lives in Machen with his family and is a community councillor and school governor. He works for a national non-profit organisation promoting entrepreneurship in education and has founded several local businesses. Steve says he is standing to give Caerphilly a strong, independent voice in the Senedd who puts people first. What are his policies? Fix the social care crisis to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child aged nine months to four years, so that every parent in Caerphilly has access to affordable and flexible childcare. Prioritise education, ensuring young people in Wales have equal access to opportunity as young people in England. Bring jobs back to Caerphilly, challenging a Cardiff-centric City Deal that has failed to deliver for local people. Protect local services that are under threat from Labour locally and in the Senedd. Anthony Cook - Gwlad Glenn Whitehouse Who is he? Anthony Cook grew up in Cefn Hengoed, lives in Ystrad Mynach and says his family has been ""part of the Rhymney Valley mining history for generations"". He is a father of three children that he takes on ""adventures over Parc Penallta and Gelligaer Common"" and says that, as a boy, he ""played in the shadow of Penallta colliery and caught the C9 bus to Bargoed to go shopping with my nan in a once thriving high street"". He says he understands the ""struggles that have followed the decline of our traditional industries"". The name of his party, Gwlad, means country in Welsh. What are his policies? Help town centres by building homes, siting public services such as polyclinics (centres for GP surgeries, outpatients and minor injuries) there and encouraging evening shop opening, at least from April to October. Reform VAT; as new build is free of the tax but repair is not, making it cheaper to build new on the outskirts of town rather than restore the old centre. The elected Welsh government should run Wales, not boards and panels of the ""great and the good"" which require additional funding to administer and give ministers a way to evade responsibility. End subsidies for renewable energy schemes such as solar farms that are destroying good agricultural land. Oppose Welsh government funding of politically partisan NGOs (non-governmental organisations), eg those that campaign for men to access women's spaces. Gareth Hughes - Green Party Who is he? Gareth Hughes, who lives in Caerphilly, was born in Bangor and educated at Friars Grammar School, Coleg Harlech and the London School of Economics. He has been an apprentice printer, print journalist, university lecturer, researcher and played a prominent role in the early days of housing associations in Wales. He returned to journalism, with the creation of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s, as an ITV Wales political reporter and commentator, later analysing public life for BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and others. What are his policies? Create green jobs for people where they live. Provide better public services - including more evening bus services and warm, safe housing. Build stronger communities with empowered local voices. Promote a fairer, greener future tackling the climate emergency. Gareth Potter - Welsh Conservatives Welsh Conservatives Who is he? Gareth Potter is married with two children and has lived in Ebbw Vale since last year. Born in Pontypool, he grew up on a Trevethin council estate and attended West Monmouth Comprehensive School. He worked for retailers, including Matalan, then in charity retail with the British Heart Foundation before focusing on politics full-time. He was previously a staff member for Conservative South Wales East Senedd member Natasha Asghar and worked, for the last four years, as a campaign manager for Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservatives. What are his policies? Scrap business rates for small businesses to allow our forgotten high streets to grow, creating more local jobs and reducing unemployment across Caerphilly and growing tourism. Ban mobile phones in schools by rolling out lockable phone pouches across all schools in Caerphilly and ensure children are automatically excluded for carrying knives into school. Push to extend GP services beyond 09:00 BST to 19:00 and review NHS hospital planning which has seen hospitals like Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr designed for A&E services but instead all A&E going to the Grange in Torfaen 30mins away for residents living just yards from Ystrad Fawr. Scrap Wales' 20mph default speed limit and build an M4 relief road south of Newport to support growth in our town and villages across Caerphilly. Keep local services open while cutting council waste, scrapping the Senedd expansion while initiating an Anti-Waste Action Plan. Llŷr Powell - Reform UK Reform UK Who is he? Llŷr Powell has lived and worked in Caerphilly for the last five years and has called the area home for much of his professional life, aside from a brief hiatus to work in the House of Commons in 2024. He has worked in communications in public, political and charitable organisations, including roles in political communications and public affairs, where he has used his platform to highlight issues facing the left-behind communities of south Wales. He is a fluent Welsh speaker, and describes himself as an enthusiastic supporter of grassroots Welsh rugby and a keen follower of the national side. What are his policies? Protect the NHS, free at the point of delivery, with free prescriptions. Champion shorter waiting lists, more frontline staff, proper funding and an upgrade for Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. Support local high streets, be a strong voice for Caerphilly's local economy and prioritise attracting much-needed investment to create more opportunities and jobs in this area. End the Nation of Sanctuary policy, which has wasted £55m of taxpayers' money. Fight to keep libraries open as the Labour council wants to close 10 of them while sitting on almost £190m in reserves as council tax keeps rising. Ensure reserves are spent on local communities not wasteful projects. Get Wales moving again by pushing to reverse Labour's 20mph speed limits, which are negatively impacting Caerphilly's economy and putting businesses off investing in the region. Back better and safer transport links. Roger Quilliam - UKIP Roger Quilliam Who is he? Roger Quilliam has been a member of UKIP's National Executive Committee since 2024. The party says he has worked for over two years closely with party leader Nick Tenconi in activism and citizen journalism for UKIP, Turning Point UK, and Disciples of Christ. UKIP says he campaigns against mass immigration, communism, liberalism, and in favour of patriotism, nationalism, and traditionalism and that his core values are rooted in family, community, national identity, justice, and law and order. What are his policies? Abolish the Senedd. Freeze immigration for a minimum of five years. Mass deportations and remigration. Reinstate Christianity back into the heart of government and put Britons first. Richard Tunnicliffe - Welsh Labour Welsh Labour Who is he? Richard Tunnicliffe has lived in Caerphilly with his Troedyrhiw-born wife Lynda for 26 years and they raised their three sons in the town. He has worked as an accountant and financial analyst and runs a publishing company with his wife, specialising in Welsh translations of popular children's books. He was encouraged to become more active in the local party by Hefin David, who was mentoring him to be a candidate in next year's Senedd election at the time of his death. What are his policies? Honour Hefin David's legacy by listening to constituents and solving community problems together. Champion Bevan's NHS by working proactively with local health service leaders. Earn trust by doing what I say I will do and never over-promising. Calling for the council to prioritise protecting libraries across the borough and use any future funding to do so. Lindsay Whittle - Plaid Cymru Plaid Cymru Who is he? Lindsay Whittle was born in Caerphilly town, he lives in Abertridwr, was raised on the Penyrheol council estate and attended Cwm Ifor Primary School. A councillor for Penyrheol since 1976, he was Caerphilly council leader from 1999 to 2004 and 2008 to 2011, and has been Plaid Cymru group leader on the council since 2022. From 2011 to 2016 he was a South Wales East assembly membe r (as Senedd members were previously known). What are his policies? Campaign for a fair funding settlement for Wales to help protect local services and oppose cuts, recently opposing plans to close public libraries and a leisure centre across the Caerphilly constituency. Attract quality jobs through Plaid Cymru's Making Wales Work plan, giving locally-owned small and medium-sized businesses and co-operatives in Caerphilly more help and adjusting business rates to boost town centres. Billions spent on rail projects in England, such as HS2 and the Oxford-Cambridge line, bring extra money to Scotland and Northern Ireland but not Wales. Releasing cash for Wales would help pay for local improvements. Invest in primary healthcare: Lindsay Whittle supports Plaid Cymru's plan to set up elective care hubs to get people seen faster, with a triage system to speed up referrals between GPs and hospitals.

2ae140198d13,The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter,,"The battle is on for the Conservatives to show they matter Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC ""Oh God,"" and then a pause, a sigh, and then, ""Oh God,"" again. Just as a senior Conservative was telling me the party might be able to climb out the terrible hole it's in, news popped up of another of its ranks deserting for Reform UK. Their response? Sad resignation, at yet another resignation. The individual exit of Sarah Atherton, who was briefly a defence minister when the Tories were in power, is not the point. Well over a dozen Conservative MPs or former MPs have made that same move. The question for the Conservatives perhaps this weekend is: is there a point? You don't need me to tell you that the Conservatives are unpopular - deeply so. The hangover from the last election was always going to be nasty after a proper thumping, 14 years in power, and, oh yes, those five prime ministers. But the party's standing has fallen even further since then. No discernible bounce with its new leadership under Kemi Badenoch. No profit from the misery of the government. For the group once regarded as the most successful political operation in the western world, it's dire. Technically, the Tories are still the main opposition. That brings status and meaning. It's Badenoch who gets to ask six questions of the prime minister every week. It's the Conservatives who, as is traditional, are most often called on to respond to government announcements. They still have way more MPs than the Liberal Democrats, or the SNP, and legions more than Reform or the Greens. But politically, it just doesn't feel at this moment that they are the government's hungry main challengers. That's in part because they were smashed to bits in July 2024 and it was always going to take a bit of time to come round. It's in part because the party is so far behind in the polls. It's in part because the government is very deliberately making its arguments against Reform, not their traditional Conservative rivals. As another senior party figure observes, Labour's ""framing of cutting the Tories out is the right one"". It suits Labour and the Lib Dems to treat the Tories as if they are irrelevant. And it's in part, many Conservatives argue, because Badenoch ""just hasn't generated any traction, any attention"" during her time in charge. As the Conservatives arrive in Manchester for their conference, in the very serious aftermath of the attack on Heaton Park synagogue, the primary job is to grab any attention: perhaps the Tory party is smack bang in the middle of a battle to matter at all. Reuters Prime Minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer Like it or not, just as Sir Keir Starmer has discovered, grumpy parties who are not doing well point the finger at their leader. Badenoch has admirers in the Conservative Party for speaking out on particular issues like single-sex spaces, free speech, or declaring that some cultures are in her view ""less valid"" than others. Some of her colleagues applaud her blunt, tell-it-like-it-is manner. But politics is also a business of charm and empathy. A senior Tory told me after the election defeat the party had to ""go everywhere and do a mea culpa, to listen and take a kicking"". But the issue with Badenoch, they say, is ""she is grand... hasn't been anywhere and isn't listening to anyone"". Ouch. With conference about to start, it's almost a Tory tradition to fill the papers and podcasts with gripes about the party leader. She has had some more effective performances at Prime Minister's Questions. Policies are starting to emerge. Money has kept flowing to the party.  One of her backers maintains that although she is still ""finding her way"", she has some of the same ""strength and character as a young Margaret Thatcher"". Thatcher was seen as ""strange and shrill"" when she got the job, but became the party's most successful boss of modern times. But as Badenoch approaches a year in the job, it's becoming harder to find people who'll make that comparison. Whatever Badenoch's personal strengths and failures, there is a different criticism of how she has gone about the job, with a party veteran suggesting, ""there is just no pace, no nimbleness"". Maybe that should have been staring the party in the face: her original pitch for the job was ""Renewal 2030"" - a date past the next general election. During many of her interviews Badenoch has said she wants to take her time working out the right moves for the party, developing credible ideas rather than being rushed. You can expect lots of policy to be unveiled in the next few days. But politics moves incredibly fast, and another source agrees pace is a problem, saying: ""What she misunderstood is you get one chance to introduce yourself to the public – she lost the chance to generate any traction and she won't get that back."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was only too happy to step into that ""vacuum"", gaining strength in the polls and grabbing headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans. Getty Images Badenoch after delivering a speech at the Institute of Chartered Accountants' Hall in September Candidly, it is not unusual to hear Conservatives saying freely in private that Badenoch won't be in the job for long, she could be ""out by Christmas"", or ""might not even have to be dragged out"" if the party bombs at the polls in a set of mega elections in May. Indeed, when asked the question herself in a conference warm-up interview, she more or less said: Well, ask me then. Refreshingly honest from a leader who isn't fully in control of her own destiny? Or foolhardy when this is a moment when she ought to be mustering as much authority as she can? The conference gives a shop window to the party and its leader to show what she is made of too. As one senior MP says: ""This conference is about her, and making it clear she has a direction and a sense of where she is going, and it is hers and she is going to lead it – we have this one chance."" ""We understand the polls aren't great, a source close to the party leadership adds. ""There needs to be a bit of understanding from those who are grumbling."" But where is Badenoch trying to lead? ""If I want a can of full fat coke, then I go and buy one, if I like what Reform are saying I'm gonna vote Reform, I'm not going to vote for a party that's not quite there,"" a party insider says. Badenoch's signals on climate change, on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, tip towards the right of the Conservative spectrum, on territory that right now, Reform have painted in bold primary colours. Bloomberg via Getty Images Reform leader Nigel Farage has grabbed headlines while the Tories were busy making other plans Badenoch is a Brexiteer, a strong advocate of free speech, and seemingly often up for a spat in the latest round of culture wars. But politics is a business - not quite like any other - but a business nonetheless. And many in the party reckon she is going after the wrong customers and ought to be trying to appeal more to soft liberals or soft Tories, rather than to those interested in Reform. ""Frankly, the gap in the market is on the centre right,"" one source says. Some of the current Tory top brass are keen to get the argument onto issues they hope might appeal more to more voters, and it's not stupid to guess it, yes, the economy. One shadow minister says: ""We have to talk about the money in your pocket and trying to articulate what all of Labour's tax rises and debt means to you in terms of the cash in your pocket and the food in your fridge."" With Reform UK in the ascendant, are they the right enemy for the Tories in any case, one source wonders? Their presence on the right means the Conservatives right now don't have the luxury of assuming they will always be the number two. The party used to be ""free to carry on in opposition in our own space – now when the party looks for who its enemy is, is it Labour, Reform or Lib Dems, or it doesn't know?"". According to one source close to the party leadership, in recent years people have struggled to know what the party stands for: ""We have flip-flopped, criss-crossed, gone from [Theresa] May to [Boris] Johnson, to [Rishi] Sunak."" There will be big announcements over the next few days setting out Badenoch's position ""and it will be the job of MPs and councils and everyone to go and sell that message"". Getty Images Badenoch giving a speech earlier this year As party members and associated hangers-on start to arrive in Manchester today, there are reasons to be gloomy for the current leadership. If you look back at the polling, Badenoch is in a worse position according to net satisfaction ratings than John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, David Cameron, Theresa May,  Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. (If you're wondering, I didn't forget Liz Truss, but she wasn't around long enough to have her popularity measured after nearly a year). ""I don't remember it ever being this bad,"" says one insider, suggesting not just that Badenoch's time will be up before too long, but also that the party has been hollowed out of experience and knowledge, and many of the big-name MPs who have stuck around have, frankly, rather checked out. But one of Badenoch's backers suggests it's the party, not the leadership, that ought to have a word with itself. They told me their colleagues have got a ""messiah complex - ever since Margaret they think there is a leader out there who will lead them to the promised land"". In other words, get your heads down, get your work done, and stop thinking it's all about the person at the top. ""We need to understand real history, not folk history,"" they say, suggesting a new leader would not and could not solve the party's problems on their own. Do it again, and a frontbencher suggests ""people will think, 'Oh God, they haven't changed!'"" But the overall picture for the Tories' top team is as foul as the weather in Manchester which awaits them. ""They're not relevant, they don't matter - that is the big thing the current team have not understood,"" one Tory source worries. ""If it's not resolved soon it's easy to see  how we might be in third or even fourth place"" when it gets to the next election, they add. Not for the first time, you don't need me to remind you - but I will - that politics in the 2020s is a very unpredictable era. There are known unknowns. Might Badenoch pull off a blinding speech this week? Will Labour be patient with Sir Keir until the general election? Will Reform hold together? Will the economy improve? And unknown unknowns that we can't list right now. And anyone who claims to know what's next may as well be trying to sell ice to an Eskimo. The Conservative party has been pronounced more or less gone before. There was even a book published titled ""The Strange Death of Tory England"". Five years later, David Cameron strolled into No 10. But the party is in trouble. Conferences are always an opportunity for political parties, but also a risk. The pressure is on the Tories to show they matter in the next few days, or more on their own side may wonder what they're for.

b27281916b71,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza?",,"Trump trusts Blair, others don't - could he govern Gaza? James Landale Diplomatic correspondent Getty Images As prime minister of the UK for more than 10 years, Sir Tony Blair was a master of political compromise. He was seen as a deft negotiator of the centre ground, triangulating his way out of the straitjacket of traditional left-right politics. But if there were peace in Gaza and he were summoned to help govern what was left, would even Teflon Tony – as he was once known – have the political wiles to keep all sides happy and the guns silent? His putative role is still not clear. Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan envisages an international transitional body that would oversee the governance of post-war Gaza. The US president would chair this so-called ""Board of Peace"" and Sir Tony, aged 72, would be a member. He's a ""good man, very good man"", Trump told reporters. Sir Tony's presence on this hypothetical body would come as no surprise. The former prime minister has been closely involved in drawing up Gaza peace proposals for months. He has been working with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Ron Dermer, a key adviser to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In August, Sir Tony attended a high-level meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss a post-war strategy for the Strip. A month earlier he also held talks with Steve Witkoff, the president's chief envoy, at the White House. In a statement, Sir Tony unsurprisingly lavished praise on the Trump plan, describing it as ""bold and intelligent"" and ""the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering"". He said the proposals created the possibility not only ""of Israelis and Palestinians finding a path to peace"" but also ""a broader regional and global alliance to counter the forces of extremism and promote peace and prosperity between nations"". And that is the key point: this is what Sir Tony has been pushing for decades in different roles. As prime minister from 1997, he supported the Clinton administration's efforts to find peace in the region. On the very day he left office in June 2007, he was appointed special envoy for a so-called Quartet - representing the US, Russia, the EU and UN – designed to coordinate peace efforts, a role he held until 2015. His supporters insist his remit at the Quartet was economic development and he was excluded from the political process. Since then his business and other interests – including his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change - have kept him firmly plugged into the region. Diplomats say this is what makes Sir Tony unique; he is trusted by the Trump administration, he has an unparalleled network in the Middle East, and he has long experience of dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Nick Hopton, director general of the Middle East Association, said the former UK PM was the only western leader one could imagine taking the role. ""He's got the credibility and experience having been embroiled in the Middle East for 24 years,"" he said. ""But it will work only if he is able to have the confidence of Donald Trump and also if he is not seen as being manipulated by Benjamin Netanyahu. He also needs to demonstrate he has the confidence of the Palestinian Authority leadership."" But – and it is a big but – Sir Tony would come to the role with much baggage. To some he is a divisive figure, to others worse. Role in Iraq invasion 'not forgotten' His role in joining the 2003 invasion of Iraq - based on incorrect reports about the country's weapons of mass destruction – still tarnishes his reputation in the region and has led some to accuse him of war crimes. Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, was blunt. ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine,"" she posted on social media. ""Shall we meet in The Hague perhaps?"", a reference to the location of the International Criminal Court. Sir Simon Fraser, former head of the UK Foreign Office, said Sir Tony had shown genuine interest in the Palestinian issue and was trusted in Washington, Israel and the Gulf. ""But the Arab street has not forgotten Iraq,"" he said. ""The future oversight of Gaza needs a broader base and cannot look like an American/British enterprise."" Hamas, for one, did not seem keen. Husam Badran, a member of the group's political bureau, said this week Sir Tony should be on trial for the US invasion of Iraq, not administering Gaza. ""Any plan linked to Blair is an ill omen,"" he said. Some Palestinians and others also see Sir Tony as historically always being too close to Israeli and US positions. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, a former international peace negotiator, said: ""I don't think the Palestinians trust him at all. I think they view him as a colossal failure during the time that he was the Quartet envoy."" Even UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who used his Labour conference speech on Tuesday to praise the Trump peace plan, chose to make no mention of the key role his predecessor might play. As Middle East peace envoy for eight long years, Sir Tony was supposed to help build up the Palestinian Authority so that one day it would be in a fit state to run a Palestinian state. But few would argue that this is where the PA is today. Palestinians also argue he did not do enough to push back against illegal settlements and settler violence. Some have claimed he should have made a stronger case for Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on economic development. Getty Images As former Quartet special envoy Tony Blair met Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014 The interesting question is why Sir Tony still feels the need to be involved in trying to find an end to the fighting in the Middle East. He has long seen himself as a peace-maker, after his success negotiating the Good Friday Agreement that helped reduce conflict in Northern Ireland. But as a political correspondent throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and thus a close observer of the Blair years of power, I was always struck by his dogged refusal to accept that he might have failed to persuade someone of his point of view. It niggled at him. To that extent, the Middle East may be seen by Sir Tony as unfinished business. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told PA Media Sir Tony's role would ""raise eyebrows"" because of the Iraq war and said he had an ""incredible legacy"" in Northern Ireland of building peace that lasted. ""If he can bring that skill set to bear in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the support of Israelis, Palestinians and other regional powers, then so much the better,"" Mr Streeting said. In truth, the role of Blair is a second order issue. He will have a job to do only if this peace plan succeeds and survives, and there is no guarantee of that. Far more important are the differences between both sides and details that are as yet unresolved by the framework outlined by the White House. Sanam Vakil, Middle East programme director at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""The focus on Tony Blair and his legacy of western intervention in Iraq masks the real challenges of this peace framework that lacks details, timelines and deliverables - and does not yet have Palestinian or Israeli buy-in, let alone leadership. ""Without significant work to move beyond 20 points on a piece of paper, this plan will be another version of cosmetic diplomacy that embeds structural injustice and deprives Palestinians of agency and sovereignty."" So maybe what really matters is not perhaps the psychodrama of Sir Tony Blair and the controversial opinions people hold about him. A more relevant question may be more what role any transitional authority in Gaza might play and whether Sir Tony has the right skills and experience to play a significant role. If his job would be to coordinate with Gulf leaders and the White House, that is one thing. But if he were being asked effectively to govern Gaza, overseeing the reconstruction, the security and economic development of the Strip, that is quite another. ""Viceroy Blair?"" one diplomat texted me. ""That will never wash.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d5938w3ko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ebc5/live/f21cee50-9e2b-11f0-ba41-9d184b600492.jpg,2025-09-30T19:31:18.674000+00:00,0664df86f879ca2d24ecbbd482679548e1a50884
5fb84056c04c,Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage,,"Why Starmer wants to keep talking about Farage Matt Chorley Presenter, BBC Radio 5 Live Getty Images ""Know yourself and know your enemy,"" wrote Sun Tzu, the Chinese military adviser from the 6th century BC. ""In a hundred battles, you will never be defeated."" Sir Keir Starmer might not quite have 100 battles, but he's got a fair few on his hands: with his party, with the bond markets, with the mayor of Greater Manchester. And yet the prime minister, who still helms an enormous Commons majority, has a resolute focus on who the singular enemy is. And it's a party with five MPs: Reform UK. Time and again, Sir Keir has chosen during Labour's conference week to focus on Nigel Farage, having written off the Conservatives as ""dead"" and barely mentioning the Lib Dems, Greens or other parties eating into Labour support from the left. 'Different fight' But in the lanyard-laden fringes and bars in Liverpool, there is a live conversation about the wisdom of this strategy. Does naming your enemy so publicly help bring focus to the government's operation and attack? Or does it risk elevating Reform UK, a new party with no record in government, to an elite status which only serves to bolster rather than damage them? Reform UK love it. Whenever the prime minister goes out of his way to mock or ridicule them during PMQs, Farage and his MPs including Richard Tice and Lee Anderson slap their thighs in pantomime laughter, believing they are being paid a high compliment. At the weekend, Sir Keir said the fight with Reform is different. ""Most elections have always been Labour or Conservative,"" he said. ""This is a different election that we are facing.  We have not had a proposition like Reform in this country ever before. This is a different fight. It is a fight about who we are as a country, it goes to the soul of our future."" Some in Liverpool this week have likened this to Joe Biden's repeated refrain against Donald Trump in 2020 that they were locked in a ""battle for the soul of the nation"". However, some within Labour are unsure if the strategy of attacking Farage is the right approach. One backbench MP from the North East told me that those in Downing Street advising the PM ""don't get it"" - and don't represent ""white, working class council estates"" with voters that worry about immigration. ""They tend to be the frothy coffee drinking liberal lefties. They are speaking to the same people,"" they added. Others suggest that keeping Kemi Badenoch's Conservative party alive, or at least their share of the vote up, is needed to split the vote on the right. One senior minister said: ""The Tories being dead doesn't help us, it just pushes people to Reform. It's a bit like how at the last general election we needed the Lib Dems to do well, as they took seats off the Tories rather than us. ""But this is worse, because both Tory and Labour are voters shifting to Reform. In places from Barnsley to Bexley, we need the right vote to split, and then we need to squeeze Lib Dems and the Greens to come down the middle."" John Denham, a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government, agrees. ""It makes no sense to me to elevate Reform to that position, even if you think the Tories are dead,"" he told me on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have four years left of this government. The idea that the only thing we think we can offer in four years time is 'well, at least we're not Reform'... surely to God we can do something with the huge majority we've got and the time we've got to tell a convincing story that marginalizes Reform."" He suggested that there were a ""really very small"" group of people who might switch between Reform and Labour. The latest YouGov poll suggests just over half of Labour's 2024 voters are sticking with them. Some 12% have switched to Reform, and 4% to the Conservatives, while another 13% have gone to the Lib Dems, 12% to the Greens, and others have gone to the SNP and Plaid Cymru, suggesting losses to the left are far greater than to the right. 'We love it' However, Tom Lubbock, from pollsters JL Partners, thinks focussing on Reform UK is ""extremely smart politics"". ""If you look at Labour voters who are undecided at the moment, if you force that choice and say it's a choice between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, a lot of them who are undecided will come back into the Labour boat. ""And, you know, there's a lot of time to go before that next election, but it's actually very smart at the moment to make that the choice."" Previous party leaders and governments have faced this choice about how to deal with insurgent parties under Farage. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, made around 30 references to Farage in his conference speech last week. Simon Lewis, a former director of communications for Gordon Brown, said: ""The risk is that you are seen to be taking your opponent too seriously. ""Multiple references to his name probably gets people thinking, goodness, these guys are really scared about Reform. And I think you do have to be very careful."" Number 10 insiders defend the strategy, and insist the PM is adamant that the country is at a crossroads, and he thinks it is his responsibility to stand up to Farage. So what do Reform make of party leaders falling over themselves to namecheck them and their leader? ""It made us laugh,"" said Gawain Towler, a former press adviser to Farage. ""We love it. We absolutely love it! It's so preposterous.""

3d99c7fb1bf0,Reeves pre-emptively justifies tax rises,,"In Liverpool Rachel Reeves seemed to be floating a pre-emptive argument ahead of possible tax rises in her November Budget. The key line in the chancellor's speech in relation to the Budget was her linking of tough decisions ""in coming months"" to global headwinds and a critical reassessment of the long-term productivity performance of the UK economy, about to be delivered by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""We will face further tests, with choices to come, made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and long-term damage to the economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said. This prepares the government's argument if there does need to be further tax rises, even significant ones at the Budget. Firstly, they will blame the broad global economic backdrop, of trade wars, actual wars and rising government interest rates. ""The world has changed,"" the chancellor told the Today programme. Secondly, the OBR's reassessment of the UK's long-term economic trends is revealing ""ever clearer"" evidence of ""long-term damage"" which she will blame on the record of her predecessors. The other notable call was for ""responsible management of public finances"" against opposition voices and those in her own party. Other than that, this was relatively light on policies. The policies that most of the country are the most interested in - what is in the Budget - have not been nailed down, and depend on the ping pong about to start with the OBR over its forecasting process. It is on that, where we did get new news today. The chancellor confirmed publicly that she agreed with the International Monetary Fund about changing the fiscal dance that has created non-stop speculation about tax changes. The OBR forecast by law has to happen twice a year, but that could now only happen in full once a year. There are various options. This is a tacit admission that after whatever emerges from the Budget, everyone would benefit from a period of stability, and that has not been the case over the past year. Elsewhere she repeated the idea that the election promises not to increase the main tax rates were still in place. When asked if VAT could rise, she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" This appears to connect the commitments to a state of the world that could change. As the Chief Secretary to the PM Darren Jones said: ""The manifesto commitments stand today."" Those manifesto commitments are clearly under pressure, if the OBR's calculations go against the Treasury. Her interpretation of how flexible they are was revealing. She wants to protect pay packets and ""not put up the prices in shops"". That would appear to rule out a straightforward rise in the rate of VAT, which would directly raise bills. There are many other options, depending on the size of the gap - to be revealed to her by the OBR this week - from scrapping some tax breaks and allowances, especially on housing and pensions, to extending the freeze on tax thresholds. The changes made by the OBR to the UK's underlying rate of growth could add considerably to the gap in the public finances Reeves has to bridge in the Budget. The draft details will be presented to her on Friday. It is then and only then that the real work of translating a series of tax proposals into a Budget starts in earnest. The government will also seek to persuade the OBR that its policy moves, from infrastructure plans, to closer ties with Europe, can help long-term growth. Today was about leaving some options open, at a tricky time. The extent of tax rises, and who gets hit, is still very much up for grabs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6x07j9e43o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b00d/live/35d04c80-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-29T16:36:04.080000+00:00,49bd84822a5e22116dd9d6bf818121ae5ed450d3
60200561be67,Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?,,"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business? Simon Jack Business editor WPA Pool/Getty Images One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as ""the natural party of business"" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be ""the most pro-business government this country has ever seen"". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour . Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: ""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. ""Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential."" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. ""I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,"" he says. ""I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses."" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. ""Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI."" PA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at ""the level of negative components"" they faced after the last Budget Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. ""I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time."" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says ""they need to move quickly"". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. ""I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that."" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. ""I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. ""I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person."" The new Employment Rights Bill , which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff. Mark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: ""The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally."" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. ""I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. ""They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn."" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xyxnyz48o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7aa5/live/803f8e10-9af1-11f0-89b4-1b2d09c610c7.jpg,2025-09-29T06:29:26.809000+00:00,4012358ec77c35c2ca0ec06f7ff0a9cbde553a3f
f0865c91c474,How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job?,,"How much trouble is Labour in - and is the PM the right man for the job? Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Sir Keir Starmer achieved what many sage minds in Westminster believed was impossible. Labour smashed itself to bits in 2019. But Sir Keir put the party back together and swept back to power with an epic majority five years later. Yet, turn on the radio or glance at the headlines and Labour appears to be flirting with the unthinkable – giving him his P45. In the last few days I've spoken to 30 people across government and the party -  ministers, MPs, advisers - to try to work out, as the prime minister makes his way to Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, how much trouble is he really in? ""How many more data points do you need to see that he is just not very good at being prime minister?"" Unforgiving as that sounds, the Whitehall figure who posed that question is far from the only person who has seen Starmer's government up close to conclude that fundamentally, the prime minister is just not suited to many aspects of the job. For months polling has suggested the public feels the same. Sir Keir is an intelligent, incredibly diligent, serious-minded politician who has achieved extraordinary things. But time and again the same problems are raised, summed up brutally by another senior figure: ""His judgement on people has proven to be flawed, see endless staffing resets."" ""His judgement on policy is flawed, hence U-turns, and he can't communicate, and has been unpopular in the public's eyes for a long time."" Others point to a slow pace of decision making in Downing Street, suggesting the prime minister thinks ""too like a chairman, not a chief executive,"" says another insider. And ""he only gets to the right answer having exhausted all the other options,"" rather than moving fast using a gut political instinct. Another senior party figure says: ""He doesn't think like a leader."" Getty Images Everyone in the Labour party is fed up with months of shocking polls. But others are fed up of colleagues complaining about the boss, whether the small number who do so in public, or the much higher number who do so in private. ""It's like being England manager,"" one cabinet minister jokes. ""Everyone thinks they can do a better job."" You can hear the frustration in others' voices, highlighting the ""outstanding job"" Starmer has done on the world stage – wrangling President Donald Trump, or leading support for Ukraine. ""He hasn't put a foot wrong,"" when it comes to foreign policy, says a cabinet minister. Another praises the ""sensible changes"" the prime minister has just made to Downing Street, saying ""people now are now in jobs that will suit their abilities better"" after the reshuffle, and promising the public will soon see the benefit. There can be no hiding from a very messy few weeks, with the forced exits of Angela Rayner and Lord Mandelson , and the circus around the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham's not very hidden ambition. But there are other believers in what they see as Starmer's steady and relentless leadership, as one party source jokes: ""There were a couple of weeks where we couldn't get of bed without accidentally tearing our own arms off."" They predict ""that could all go away if we have a decent couple of months"". Perhaps. What even some of the prime minister's staunchest allies believe is that, he must explain more clearly, and vigorously, to the party - and to all of us - what the government is actually doing and why. Getty Images Sir Keir himself admitted as much in the summer, saying: ""We haven't always told our story as well as we should."" So in the next few days, and live on the programme tomorrow, expect the prime minister to try hard to make a clearer pitch to the country. After a horrible few weeks, aides say the prime minister is in a ""better place, clearer about the argument he wants to make"". Announcements like the Hillsborough Law, the returns deal with France, and yesterday's confirmation that ministers will go ahead with digital ID cards will convey, No 10 hopes, a sense of momentum. And you can expect him to build on the argument he's been making about patriotism in politics, trying to reclaim some of the territory Reform UK have been trying to grab. There are two problems though. Firstly, even Starmer's biggest fans in government know fluid communication is not his strong point. He doesn't see the camera, or the TV sofa as his friend. A strong defender of Starmer tells me: ""I wish he was better at telling a story, people don't understand how deeply he feels it and how passionate he is, but he personally isn't good at it."" Secondly, and according to one senior MP this is the bigger issue: ""We're just not clear about what we are doing or who we are for."" Another staffer tells me: ""There is no fire, no passion, no vision – we are timid and flat-footed."" Even if the prime minister suddenly developed the silky charm and persuasiveness of George Clooney, or the bombastic nature of Piers Morgan, the question becomes, what is the story he wants to tell? Multiple exits from the No 10 communications team tell you that working this out is not an easy task. Getty Images One source says: ""Until we know the story we are trying to tell we will get buffeted around."" Is reforming schools, hospitals or welfare at the top of the list?  Building houses or becoming a green ""superpower""? Or being at the forefront of technology, or protecting our borders, or growing the economy? Or is it now this priority of ""patriotic renewal""? If you have that many priorities, how can the public understand what you care about most? To govern is to choose after all, if you're not doing much choosing, are you doing much governing? One source suggested frankly, even for those who work closely alongside him, it's often hard to work out what the prime minister thinks, telling me: ""He often appears unknowable."" ""He compartmentalises his life - personal, professional, and political - in a way that works for him, but leaves colleagues unsure of his true views."" In a sense it seems extraordinary that the leader of a political party can leave colleagues unsure of their views, after 14 months in office, and four years as leader in opposition. But his early years in charge were dominated by internal fights for control of the party, and over antisemitism, not over ideas. One source recalls: ""We had lots of fights to win in opposition, but they were never, ever about what the parties' priorities should be."" Getty Images The prime minister has a huge chance in the next few days to spell out to his party, and to the public, exactly where he stands, and exactly what he believes in specific terms. After a horrible summer, and a very tricky year, it is desperately needed if the party is to get back on track. ""There is a way through this, but he has to assert himself,"" says one cabinet minister, desperate for the prime minister to remind his party and the country why they elected him in the first place. Ministers and Downing Street are frustrated by chatter about Starmer's leadership, especially the behaviour of Andy Burnahm in recent days. ""Everyone needs to just shut up and get on with their own jobs,"" one government source says. Another says: ""the Burnham stuff is just ridiculous."" ""He doesn't have a seat in Parliament, wouldn't necessarily find or win one,"" and one minister snipes, ""any chance to have a dig – Burnham will never miss an opportunity"". They predict confidently, the party ""doesn't want regicide or disruption, they just want us to do well"". But leadership chatter is a symbol that all is not well. And that sense of assurance is far from universal. One senior figure outside government warns me, ""they don't realise they are in serious, serious trouble – this is literally a head-in-hands-moment"". There are real discussions in different pockets of the Labour movement about whether Starmer should still lead the party. And the sweaty bars and fringe meetings of the party conference provide the perfect backdrop for those out to make trouble. Yet it's clear from multiple conversations that it's not only mischief makers who are pondering what to do. ""Frustration is wide and deep,"" says a senior MP. One insider who has been part of conversations about the chances of changing the leader says, ""it's not flighty people, not just newbies without a clue, they're not idiots"". Even on the government payroll one minister worries, ""the country is desperate for a disrupter, and it's just not who he is,"" questioning whether Starmer can be the right man for this political moment. Here's the fundamental question, asked by many, expressed by one senior figure: ""Do we think Keir can improve? People don't think he can, although they wish he would. But there is a sinking feeling."" Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Some MPs are even pointing to the example of the Democrats' failure to tell former President Joe Biden to go , which left the party no time to build up another candidate. The source continues we ""dread and fear being the people who didn't do what was necessary to stop the country electing Farage"". Others would baulk at that comparison. The prime minister has only had just over a year in charge. The problems Labour inherited on taking office were profound. Centre left political parties in many countries are grappling with how to deal with demographics, immigration, an era where public money is very tight. There are more than three years until the next general election. There is time to start wrestling with all of that. The electorate has shown politicians they can move in droves, and fast. So many ministers plead for patience. One wishes his colleagues would not just ""get a grip"", but remember they were all elected on a promise to stop political chaos. ""Anyone who thinks the challenging world is rectified by a change in leader, I don't understand the rationale. When we look at how unstable things are, and talk about leadership, how would the bond markets respond, when our primary responsibility is stabilising the economy?"" Another source dismisses those predicting doom in the party, ""nothing is irrevocable, and nothing is inevitable"". Perhaps the rebooted No 10 will start getting better results. Perhaps, and No 10 fervently hopes, Sir Keir will wow the crowds at conference, and display why he earned the job to start with, and won the election in the first place. The prime minister's position is also, frankly,  protected by the fact there is no consensus about who could do a better job than him. Even if Labour were to conclude universally, which it is far from doing, that Starmer's leadership is somehow beyond repair, that reality is a smack in the face for those who'd seek a change. As one Whitehall figure suggests: ""problem one, is he good at being PM? No. But next problem, do you have an upgrade? Hmm..."" Labour's answer to that question right now, notwithstanding Andy Burnham's antics, is, ""well, we're not sure"". AFP via Getty Images A lack of clarity over who would be next, and fresh memories of the political shambles of the Conservatives' change of leader, both put the brakes on anyone seeking to make a change any time soon. As ever in politics two things that might appear to be contradictory are in fact, both true. Is it mad on paper for Labour to be even vaguely contemplating changing their leader so soon, without an obvious strong successor, when they ran on a promise of no drama? For many, yes, it's crackers. But is the discussion about whether the PM can carry on like this just idle chit-chat? Not at all. One senior figure sums up the situation with no pleasure – discussion about changing the Labour leader ""is both lunatic, and real"". The leadership's hope is that a strong conference without too many noises off, and an effective speech from the platform by the prime minister himself might calm everything down. A political get together, a party conference for the politicians, members, and associated hangers-on, would never transform a prime minister's fortunes with the public overnight. But it can make a big difference to how a party feels about itself. For Starmer to have a chance of restoring his position with the public he must first, once again, persuade his party that he is the man for the job. But without restoring his party's faith in him, convincing Labour of his merits, his own position could well be at risk. One insider who knows the prime minister well suggested: ""He is not a natural explainer… he states positions but doesn't repeatedly argue for them. ""This has led to an aversion to debate, treating persuasion as weakness."" Yet politics is, above all else,  the art of persuasion. That is perhaps the dilemma for Labour. That is the problem for him.

0f4766085b7c,What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform?,,"What lessons can Starmer learn from world leaders on fighting Reform? Iain Watson Political correspondent BBC ""The country is at a crossroads,"" Sir Keir Starmer is expected to declare in a speech just ahead of the annual Labour conference, which kicks off this weekend. The prime minister will suggest there are two paths to choose: one is the way of ""division and decline"" with Reform UK, or Labour's route – unity and progress. For some in Labour's ranks, the leadership's response, so far, to the rise of Reform has gone down like a lead balloon. Not nimble enough, not impassioned, is the message. With Labour lagging in the polls, expect to hear the anti-Reform rhetoric ramped up - but exactly how to burst the populist bubble has proved challenging. The response to Reform leader Nigel Farage's proposal this week to end existing migrants' Indefinite Leave to Remain suggested that Labour hadn't quite settled on the most effective line of attack. Chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned Reform's alleged cost-savings and denounced the policy as a gimmick; Labour Party chair Anna Turley highlighted unanswered questions but also raised the prospect of families being broken up; the MP Sarah Owen also mentioned family break-up but added that this was ""morally abhorrent"". None of these responses were mutually exclusive but they differed in tone, and perhaps point to a tension between denouncing Reform as not serious - or as all too serious. Just a year ago, the Conservatives were Labour's principal opponents. The government now has to grapple with an insurgent party with no track record in office and which is eroding Labour's, not just the Conservatives', vote. And it's not a problem that's unique to the UK. Reuters Sir Keir Starmer will be eyeing the lessons from Australia, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won a second term There is concern amongst centre-left parties internationally that a rejuvenated right is doing well at the ballot box and seemingly winning the battle of ideas. So how do they fight back? The think-tank, the IPPR; the Center for American Progress and the pro-leadership Labour Together organisation have brought together an array of progressive leaders to share their electoral lessons at a major conference in London on Friday. Their big tent encompasses not just international socialist and social democratic parties but also Greens, Liberals - and even some former Conservatives. Labour strategists are looking enviously at their Australian counterparts who won a second term in May. Anthony Albanese's government tackled the immigration issue - in which they had felt vulnerable - soon after taking power and tightened rules on student and temporary visas. They were able to demonstrate a steady reduction in net migration before polling day and made the political case for continuing to bring in skilled labour - defeating an opponent who called for bigger reductions. But there won't be a single template for Labour to follow. The Spanish Socialist PM Pedro Sanchez's approach is to not to bang on about immigration but when necessary to defend it as a contributor to a growing economy, while the Danish Social Democrat PM Mette Federikson has been taking a hard line on asylum. There is nonetheless a shared recognition that a defence of the status quo is no longer sustainable. The IPPR's Harry Quilter-Pinner says it would be a mistake to follow ""the playbook of the right"". He tells me: ""The populist right's story is one of extraction – of just taking. Progressives should reject this - it stokes divisions."" He suggests when it comes to economic migration there needs to be an assessment of whether - and how quickly -  a UK citizen could be trained to do a job. He believes more of a fuss should be made of becoming British citizen, and there needs to be an expectation of what new citizens would contribute. Claire Ainsley, who was Sir Keir Starmer's policy chief when he was in opposition, is now overseeing a project on centre-left renewal at the Progressive Policy Institute, and her advice is to grow the ""seeds of doubt"" about Reform in the electorate's minds in the three years between now and the election. She believes that while people are happy to cast a protest vote, they currently question whether Reform are really a government in waiting - so challenging them on whether their policies hold together, or whether their numbers add up, is a way of undermining their support. But it does also mean doing more to tackle the core issue. She says the party leadership realised ""the previous set of answers on immigration were not going to wash with the British public that want to see action"", and says she was encouraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promise that ""nothing is off the table"" in tackling illegal migration. But tackling Reform isn't just about immigration. Ms Ainsley says it's about people feeling worse off and not feeling they have got a fair deal on the economy,  and a sense that other people are getting treated better than them. The current buzzword around government is ""contribution"" - convincing people that they will be beneficiaries and not just contributors to a welfare state. This is likely to be developed further in the main Labour conference speeches in Liverpool next week. Previewing that, Labour Together published a report this week. In it, chief policy officer Morgan Wild argues that over the past decades, the link between what people put in and what they get out has all but disappeared. He says: ""It is hard to explain to people why their council tax is going up while their waste service is being cut. It is hard to explain to the public why asylum seekers are being placed in hotels for years on end at the taxpayers' expense....the best way to restore trust is through the contributory principle. If you pay in, you should be able to see what you get out."" Labour MP Clive Lewis, on the party's left, doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. One of his school friends took part in the recent Unite the Kingdom march in central London . Lewis hadn't thought he'd be part of it – he had black family members and is, says Lewis, ""a great guy"" - but his friend had texted to say he felt he was being listened to. Lewis says he has seen a ""vehemence and anger"" amongst a section of the electorate who feel let down - and for Keir Starmer to be believed when he calls out Farage, he needs to be trusted. He says he believes seeing off Farage is a much bigger task than making a speech, and the prime minister has to do nothing less than change the political culture in the government and in the country. Adam Langleben of the Progressive Britain think tank also believes progressive parties need to be more ""humble"" – whether in victory or defeat. ""We have an avoidable habit of not listening enough to the electorate,"" he says. Tackling a pessimistic public mood also requires more than policies. The prime minister is a political leader who appears to know the value of symbols. Soon after winning his party's leadership in 2020, he branded Labour literature with the union flag, which was also never far from the backdrop of his TV news clips. Initially it was to help define him against his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The message was: Sir Keir would be unambiguously pro-Nato, pro nuclear deterrent, pro strong defence - proud of the flag. Safe to vote for. But those who converged in central London on the Unite the Kingdom march to hear Tommy Robinson weren't exactly waving their flags to symbolise support for Labour. It has again become a contested symbol. The prime minister is expected to say he wants to reclaim the flag. It's a problem that previous Labour leaders have grappled with - and the current one can perhaps learn from. When Neil Kinnock was the Labour opposition leader in the 1980s, he did not want to cede the mantle of patriotism to the Conservatives, so he sought to define patriotism in line with his own beliefs, and he placed the union jack (and the flags of the UK's constituent nations) on party literature to reclaim it, he said, from the far-right party, the BNP. In the 2000s, the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown sought to claim 'Britishness' for themselves. But Keir Starmer faces a tougher political landscape now. According to recent polling from pollster Lord Ashcroft , the public can't agree on why union and English flags have been appearing on lampposts, and whether or not this is a good thing. Labour, Lib Dem and Green voters tend to think they signal hostility to immigrants; while right of centre voters believe they are signs of frustration with immigration. Overall, 39% of respondents supported the appearance of the flags while 28% disapproved - but about a quarter of voters surveyed had mixed feelings. Despite obvious divisions, Adam Langleben believes it is possible to create a ""progressive patriotism"", taking a leaf from the maiden speech of the murdered MP Jo Cox , which celebrated diversity but recognised that ""we have far more in common than that which divides us"". Reform UK have been clear what they are against. But some of the prime minister's own MPs say he can only really be successful in taking on Reform if he is clearer about what he is for.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5703yn77o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5e19/live/7804c0a0-99f5-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-09-25T11:25:24+00:00,d56df95abf9dbe270b0bdcf5259c7a69c39acb5d

The department said ""officials are working at pace with [the minister] to determine how we will move forward with a War Memorial"". The trust took this as welcome confirmation that the new Labour government did intend to honour the previous government's commitment to make a grant available to help fund a Muslim war memorial, even if it was not confirmation the memorial would definitely go ahead. Over the following months Sir William continued to press for a decision and whether the Â£1m was still available. In November 2024, the department said that it remained ""committed to providing funding of up to Â£1m"", and officials were working on taking the matter forward. The following month, an exercise to gather information about suppliers was launched, which the trust responded to. But by May this year, nothing had happened. Sir William emailed again to ask about progress, but the response again was that no decision had yet been made. Sir William now says: ""Silence reigns."" ""The issue is not that the government is obliged to support the trust's memorial,"" Sir William says. ""It is when we can expect a decision whether it will provide any financial support and, if so, how much and on what terms. On that hangs how we approach others to give to the project.""

93bec1d5998d,Burnham's provocative challenge to Starmer shows he is serious,,"Location: party conference. A fairly new prime minister is struggling for popularity with his party and the country at large, against a backdrop of grim economic choices. A popular, plain-speaking mayor enters the week talked up as a future leader  — and is doing little to dampen that speculation himself. The year is 2012, the prime minister is David Cameron and the mayor is Boris Johnson. But it could just as well be 2025, Sir Keir Starmer and Andy Burnham. Sometimes politicians of all parties flirt with the possibility of one day becoming leader in suggestive, coy, almost deniable ways. This is not an example of that. Burnham is being more overt. To the Telegraph, the Greater Manchester mayor gave a straight answer to a straight question: yes, he had been contacted by Labour MPs ""throughout the summer"" about the prospect of him returning to Westminster, where he was an MP for 16 years, to lead Labour and replace Starmer as prime minister. Burnham said this was ""more a decision for those people than it is for me"". He repeated that line in an interview with BBC Manchester. Well, up to a point. Burnham is not an MP. He would have to decide to become one if he wants to be Labour leader and prime minister. Labour's rule book dictates that the party leader must be an MP, so when the party is in government that means the prime minister must also be an MP, meaning they have to be elected to Parliament rather than made a member of the Lords. This means that his path to Downing Street is extremely complicated. First, a Labour MP would need to resign their seat so there is a by-election - unless a contest happened to arise through an MP dying or similar. Because of Burnham's distinctive regional pitch, the constituency would surely have to be in Greater Manchester or at least the north-west of England. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, have already ruled out standing down for Burnham. Then, Burnham would have to be selected as Labour's candidate. This would require the approval of Labour's national executive committee, which for most purposes is controlled by allies of Starmer, although at least some of those would probably support Burnham's return to Westminster. Then, he would have to win the by-election in a difficult national political environment for the Labour Party. And then, finally, Burnham would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer  - at which point presumably other candidates would enter the fray. There are a lot of difficulties along that path. Still, it is clearly a path that he is willing, at the very least, to publicly entertain. The mere existence of the Telegraph interview, alongside a long profile in the New Statesman, the bible of left-liberals, is pretty provocative. Burnham knew that he would be asked questions about his national ambitions, and that they would create a stir in the days before a crucial party conference for Starmer. Perhaps most notable, though, is that Burnham used both interviews to spell out a policy prospectus: higher council tax on expensive homes, borrowing to invest in council housing, cutting income tax for lower earners and increasing it for higher earners. In the New Statesman, he said: ""We've got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets"". That is a direct challenge not just to Starmer but to Chancellor Rachel Reeves and her view  - her supporters and plenty of experts would say the economic reality  - that the government cannot borrow much more money. It is an argument that quite a few Labour MPs make, mostly in private: that this government has allowed itself to become too constrained by Treasury orthodoxy. To have Burnham joining that argument publicly, whether his leadership challenge is plausible or not, is unwelcome for Starmer and Reeves. In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now. One senior source said he was: ""A Boris-sized ego, but without the strategic thought."" Speaking from the main stage of Conservative conference back in 2012 (an honour not being afforded to Burnham at Labour's conference next week), Boris Johnson ended up rallying the members behind David Cameron. It took him seven years to get to No 10. It's hard to see the Starmer and Burnham story taking quite so long to play out, whatever the ultimate conclusion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275r1l3xpo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da0e/live/172696c0-99e9-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg,2025-09-25T09:50:48.015000+00:00,238925805f5ba54834c3088b16ab6682e44c54db
f12bce52aabf,How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?,,"How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock? Dharshini David Deputy economics editor and Raphael Sheridan Economics reporter BBC Glenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pension At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80. Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April , will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases. The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment , underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters. That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form. Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can. There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending. No-one said getting older was easy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c07a/live/b2ce65e0-92cc-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg,2025-09-16T09:04:55.401000+00:00,86c0560311218126e96b2d16bd5d6c033b347fab
777652698006,The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney,,"The blossoming relationship between Trump and Swinney Glenn Campbell Scotland political editor The White House John Swinney lobbied Donald Trump at a meeting in the White House John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship. On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president. Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK. In early March, Swinney said it was ""unthinkable"" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question. Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to ""ethnic cleansing"". But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet. Why has John Swinney's approach changed? The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott. Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff. Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited. So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach? That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque. ""We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,"" he said. He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky. Scottish government Swinney is arguing for a reduction or removal of US import tariffs on whisky This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy. That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions. That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states. UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky. But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action? Reuters Trump opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire during his visit to Scotland Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind. The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March. I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day. He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office. Building a new relationship It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were ""thank you"". Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words. A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney ""nasty"" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign. It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built. It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections. He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again. Reuters Keir Starmer had dinner with Donald Trump during his visit to Scotland this summer There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government. However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known. That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire. Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a ""terrific guy"". It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry. He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda. Scottish government Swinney had a 50-minute conversation with Trump on his visit to Washington Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president. He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America. But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky. The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House. He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world. None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office. This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down. Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential ""win-win"" business deal to Donald Trump. The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky. A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK. Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too. If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up. If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an ""absolute blinder"". One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was ""smart politics"". PA Media Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said whisky was very high up the UK's list of priorities What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge. They enabled him to run rings round them. The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days. Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson. Eventually, the new Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander took to the airwaves to insist that the UK government had been ""thinking, working, talking and negotiating about whisky for many weeks and months"". He argued that whisky was ""very high"" up the list of priorities for the UK as it seeks further trade concessions from the US and warned Swinney against ""playing politics"". There is no certainty that whisky will get a special deal or that any announcement will come during Trump's state visit - but the industry has sensed in recent weeks that a better deal for them could be ""deliverable"". They would raise a glass to that if it happens and leave the politicians to squabble over who fought Scotch's corner the hardest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb2b/live/071a8960-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg,2025-09-17T06:07:24.876000+00:00,f677f380a7d8d4e0650cff237db5d2ee5a2cc0e5
f1fbeaddf06c,Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't,,"Scotland gives Trump three things he likes - and one thing he doesn't Sarah Smith North America editor in Scotland Getty Images A list of Donald Trump's favourite things would be very unlikely to include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (as Julie Andrews famously sang in The Sound of Music). Instead, the president's list would surely have on it playing golf, a way to brazenly promote his commercial interests and, thirdly, trade deals that generate billions of dollars for the United States. No wonder he looks so pleased with himself - his working holiday in Scotland has delivered on all three of these passions. On what was billed as a ""private visit"" he got a lot of work done. He is taking home with him a trade deal with the EU which is not only the largest in history, it is also extremely favourable to the US. The EU will spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying American energy and military equipment as well as investing billions more in the US economy. In return European goods will be subject to a 15% tariff when they are exported to the US rather than the 30% Trump had threatened. The deal is an important achievement for Trump to be able to boast about, even if he has failed to conclude the ""90 deals in 90 days"" he had promised. He also seemed to relish hosting Sir Keir and Lady Starmer at his Turnberry golf resort on Monday. It was a peculiar spectacle, the British prime minister being welcomed as guest in his own country. But the PM was prepared to overlook the protocol when he was being treated to an unusual and valuable amount of face time with the US president. Trump is, after all, a man whose foreign policy is abnormally influenced by his personal relations with other world leaders. Their talks were dominated by the crisis in Gaza. Starmer appeared to make some headway as he pressed Trump to use his influence to get more food into the Palestinian territory. Getty Images Starmer and wife Victoria were hosted by Trump at Turnberry Trump said afterwards that the US would work with the UK and other European partners to set up food centres, adding that he will tell Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure that food gets to people who need it. ""I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food."" He also seemed to give the green light to Starmer to officially recognise the state of Palestine even though that is not something the US will do. ""I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him taking a position,"" he said. Trump also made a significant change to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He revealed that he is now giving Russian President Vladimir Putin only 10-12 days to agree to a ceasefire, not the 50 days he had previously given him. ""There's is no reason in waiting… I want to be generous but we just don't see any progress being made."" All of these major announcements were made during an exceptionally long, wide-ranging and free-wheeling press conference, during which the US president appeared extremely relaxed. He was prepared to talk at length about anything from wind power to immigration, including his views on King Charles and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Watch: Trump says he turned down an invitation to Epstein's island There was one issue he could not escape, much as he perhaps wanted to. He was inevitably asked about Jeffrey Epstein, as the long running controversy about why he is refusing to release all the files held by the US government on the deceased sex offender followed him across the Atlantic. A van displaying an old photograph of Trump at a party with Epstein was driving around Aberdeenshire to make sure the president could not escape the furore. He told us for the first time why he fell out with the disgraced financier many years ago, saying that Epstein had poached staff from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and he refused to talk to him after that. And he denied ever having sent a lewd drawing to Epstein (as reported by the Wall St Journal), claiming that he only ever draws very basic pictures of buildings. The intrusion of the Epstein scandal into Trump's Scottish trip was a reminder of what inevitably awaits him on his return to Washington but it did not seem to dent his buoyant mood. A few anti-Trump protests were staged. But they were largely kept away from the president himself and were remarkably muted compared with previous visits. The most determined demonstrators were Trump fans who turned out to greet him as he landed in Prestwick and at both golf resorts, holding large signs welcoming him to Scotland. The president also took every opportunity to use this trip to proudly promote his two Scottish golf resorts. He hosted the press conferences with Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive, in the newly renovated ballroom at Turnberry, boasting of the opulent new ceiling and brand new windows at the same time as discussing famine in Gaza. Getty Images Starmer and Trump arrive by helicopter at Trump MacLeod House Arriving in Aberdeenshire with Starmer on board his Marine One helicopter, he took a couple of laps to show off the new golf course before landing. After talks with John Swinney on Tuesday morning, he had the Scottish first minister attend the official opening of the Trump International Golf Links in the village of Balmedie, along with several VIPs and a phalanx of TV cameras. It is exceptionally unusual for a US president to so nakedly use his office to promote his own commercial interests but it is something Donald Trump clearly revels in doing. Almost as much as he enjoys playing golf. Which he managed to do on almost every day of this trip.

1be69e4b2f5a,Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz,,"Badenoch hopes to grab attention with policy blitz Chris Mason Political editor 'To fix our country, we must reverse Labour's measures' says Badenoch The Conservatives have been one of the democratic world's most successful parties at winning elections. And yet a party used to standing so tall has shrivelled to Lilliputian levels. They have rarely, if ever, known a scenario so bleak. With that backdrop, a leader's position would always be questioned – and Kemi Badenoch's has been. But her speech to the party's annual conference was a confident performance, arguably her best moment yet as leader, and a fleshing out of her brand of Conservatism. She appeared relaxed and like she was enjoying herself, which is quite a thing given she would have been feeling the pressure of doing her first closing conference address as Conservative leader. The Tories spot a niche they hope they can own: to be perceived as wise custodians of the public finances. Despite the Liz Truss legacy, they have been buoyed by polling suggesting this is a perception they should lean into as a differentiator from Labour and Reform UK. What I have noticed over the last few days is something of a Darwinian selection among the people who came to the conference in Manchester. Yes, the numbers were down on where they were last year or when the party was in government, as you would expect. But those who turned up were up for the fight. I got chatting to one local party association chairman as activists headed for the station after Badenoch's speech. ""This gives us something to talk about with voters,"" they said with an approving smile, after the blitz of policy announcements in recent days. Stamp duty surprise As a new leader, Kemi Badenoch did not want to rush into announcing policies. This was partly out of a belief that you have got to think things through before you announce them. She likes to distinguish between policies and announcements, claiming her rivals will often make a splash with an idea that hasn't been properly thought through. The problem, though, is while all these policies were being worked up, the party didn't have much to say. The stand-out new policy in the speech, which the party had managed to keep under wraps until it was delivered from the lectern, was her plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland. The party sees stamp duty as a particularly bad tax, because it puts people off moving house. But the key thing here is that yes, the party has given itself something to talk about, but is anyone listening? Some of the leader's internal sceptics said they were pleasantly surprised by what they heard. Kemi Badenoch will hope this buys her some time and some attention. But in our noisy political ecosystem, neither is guaranteed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywrpelp7jo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cacf/live/cbd4f390-a45d-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T20:06:04.083000+00:00,aa9d1967197f5c6524e8117bf2eb3e3a09a23454
9cbd2a1269e7,Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness',,"Chris Mason: Why protests have started a debate over 'Britishness' Chris Mason Political editor EPA The Conservative Party conference in Manchester is taking place against a backdrop of grief and pain over last week's synagogue attack When a political party gathers for its annual conference, the host city (or at least the political and security bubble that surrounds the conference centre) becomes home to feverish and partisan political chat. What is different about the next few days is Manchester is also a city in mourning after the horrific attack on Thursday. There is, of course, still sharp political argument here but the emotional and practical backdrop is one of grief, fear and an ongoing police investigation. The flags outside the conference centre fly at half mast. A community just a few miles from here, but also all over the UK, is terrorised, frightened and grieving. Many Jewish people are furious more has not been done - for years - to protect them. And all this poses some of the biggest questions about who we are and what we hold dear. The other day the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pleaded with pro-Palestinian protesters not to head out onto the streets in the immediate days after the attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue. She argued that to do so would be ""un-British"". But others ponder just how British it is to curb repeated protests - the plan Mahmood now plans to legislate for. So what are the fundamental tenets of Britishness - a concept itself some would contest - under which a multicultural, multilingual, multireligious collection of nations such as the UK could agree on? Against the backdrop of pain and grief, this is a debate about some of the fundamentals of our society - democracy, protest, offence, tolerance (even tolerance for the intolerant) and proportionality. In addition to antisemitism, there is Islamophobia too. The home secretary talked over the weekend, rather euphemistically, about what she called ""community relations"" and others might put more baldly as racism and hatred. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK had tolerated what she called radical Islamist ideology ""for too long"". This element of the conversation around the dangers of Islamism and how it is countered is not new and itself infuriates many as we collectively wrestle with what to do about it. These are challenges for the home secretary, challenges for the government yes, but challenges for society as a whole.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7840dv7n4po,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afef/live/acb32710-a279-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T06:01:51.849000+00:00,8b1de4374fa1c138867b726cc803bb2403668971
8ee7f100cb83,Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage,,"Starmer had to show his critics he can take on Farage Chris Mason Political editor Starmer questions if Reform wants to serve ""our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country"" Sir Keir Starmer was last year's big winner at the general election. This year saw the prime minister sharpening his argument against Nigel Farage and - by extension - against those within his own party, from the cabinet down, who fret he's not the best frontman for the fight that beckons with Reform UK. There is a defiance and steeliness to the prime minister; with this performance, he reminded his internal critics just who it was who won that whopping majority in the election 15 months ago. The year gone by has been a relentless grind – not least the last few weeks, after losing the former deputy PM Angela Rayner and US ambassador Peter Mandelson - and in his speech, the prime minister wanted to remind the audience of the achievements of the past months. His critics within the Labour party remind him, relentlessly, that Labour's politics must be politically more aggressive, front-footed and pointed in order to defeat a communicator of Nigel Farage's ability. This speech was the prime minister's response. It taught us little new about Sir Keir's political creed, but persistently painted the dividing line he wants: Reform versus everyone else. And he says he's the figurehead for that fightback. Farage has claimed his migration policy being labelled ""racist"" by the prime minister had put his staff at risk; it left him ""more determined than ever"", he said. Was Sir Keir Starmer's speech up to the challenge? Is this the point where the pace quickens? The prime minister is now approaching a bleak-looking Budget and a grim set of local elections, and elections in Wales and Scotland, next May. And even his most loyal allies accept those elections could determine if he's still delivering a conference speech to the assembled party as prime minister this time next year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw1jwdlz7lo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f98/live/049f4ce0-9e26-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T17:52:33.029000+00:00,0c0d7501f6218fa32b8356e644d663a4634db3f8
caad761735e3,Labour grapples with threat from Reform UK at party conference,,"It is just 14 months since the general election. Not yet 500 days. Labour has a working majority of 161. But here on the banks of the Mersey, it really doesn't feel like that. I am reminded of Conservative conferences of old, where a circus would accompany Boris Johnson from the railway station to each and every event he attended, in the years when it was transparently clear he was rather keen on becoming prime minister. Swop a former mayor of London and subsequent prime minister for the current mayor of Greater Manchester and aspiring prime minister Andy Burnham, and you have a sense of the vibe here. There is no shortage of acidic views about what is seen as the rather thrusting nature of Burnham's ambition, or near hagiographic accounts of his governance of Greater Manchester as its mayor – with the clear implication he should stay there. But there is one big reason why all this is happening, so early in this parliament: it is symptomatic of a party wrestling publicly and privately with how it confronts Reform UK. There is broad and deep reflection from plenty here – from the cabinet to councillors – that the pitch right now from Labour to the country isn't good enough. This is why we are seeing a sharpening in the language and the policies being presented now. No fewer than 10 cabinet ministers are addressing this conference from the main stage on Monday. The centrepiece address will be from Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will argue that Reform presents a threat to the British economy with the potential, she will argue, for more borrowing and rising barriers to international trade. But perhaps more striking is the speech from the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. She has been dubbed 'the Terminator' by the tabloids. She gives every impression she might regard that nickname as a bit wishy-washy, a bit namby-pamby. ""You won't always like what I'll do,"" she will say, addressing Labour activists in front of her directly. In other words, her instincts and approach in the Home Office might make some within the party squeamish. But she sees it as absolutely essential – and the clue is in the candid observations she has already shared here at an event on the conference fringe. ""We can reclaim the mantle that was once ours and can be again: we will be the party of the working class,"" she said – an acknowledgement that, right now at least, they are not. It is a reflection, in a sentence, of how this party perceives its predicament and what it is trying to do about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr701vn0rjmo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42a2/live/42a6d600-9d06-11f0-a8fe-677b0b0b2d56.jpg,2025-09-29T08:06:22.261000+00:00,9ca067e52da09bc744ea75a5b6b3e22cac66b74d
6dda1cf1f678,Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point,,"Nick Robinson: How the simmering row over freedom of speech in the UK reached boiling point Nick Robinson BBC ""At what point did we become North Korea?"" That was the question Nigel Farage posed when asked by a US congressional committee about limitations on freedom of speech in the UK. He was condemning the ""awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into"", which he claimed had led to various arrests including that of Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan over his views on challenging ""a trans-identified male"" in ""a female-only space"". When I heard the question, I confess I thought that the leader of Reform UK had gone over the top. Farage was comparing his country - my country - with a brutal dictatorship that murders, imprisons and tortures opponents. And he was doing it in front of an influential audience of American lawmakers. Lucy North/PA Wire 'I don't regret anything I've tweeted,' Graham Linehan said earlier this month When I interviewed his deputy, Richard Tice on Radio 4's Today, I asked him whether he really believed that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was the same as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Three times I asked the question. Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using ""an analogy"". But Farage is not alone in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK. Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering. Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images Farage lambasted the 'awful authoritarian situation we have sunk into' During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a ""very dark path"" of losing free speech. The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still. In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's ""plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships"". He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, ""the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up"". So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat? Big tech dialled up the debate The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond. The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real. Police/PA Wire Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing ""threatening or abusive"" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as ""Britain's favourite political prisoner"". The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written. It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people. And I use the word ""ordinary"" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, ""I was an idiot"". But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has changed the rules for Facebook and Instagram What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years. After billionaire businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as ""a propaganda word for censorship"" - and he talks a lot about people spreading ""the woke mind virus"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also changed the rules governing Meta and Instagram. In the case of Connolly, her post was ""accelerated by the algorithm"" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University. Dilemma around policing speech The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny. Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. ""It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,"" he has said. What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who. And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous. PA Sir Mark Rowley: 'It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the content out there that enforcement is the answer' In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a ""qualified right"". This means that ""governments can restrict that right… provided that the response is proportionate - [or] 'necessary in a democratic society' is what people tend to say"", according to Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex. But some of the comments made at the protest in London earlier this month, billed by far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a ""free speech rally,"" demonstrate that, despite other controversies, that right isn't that qualified. Like nailing jelly to the wall ""Violence is coming"" and ""you either fight back or die"", Musk told flag-waving protesters via video link. Along with his call for the overthrow of the government, some might argue that his words at the rally were an incitement to violence. But the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the barrister Jonathan Hall KC, has said that Musk's words would not have broken the law. ""Politicians use martial language all the time, don't they?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Metaphors such as fights and struggles are pretty normal. And he was talking about it contingently, wasn't he? He wasn't saying: 'Go out immediately.'"" Reuters Musk called moderation ""a propaganda word for censorship"" Yet the fact both men were able to address a huge crowd in London is perhaps evidence that there is rather more leeway for free speech in this country than those likening the UK to a ""tin pot dictatorship"" suggest. According to Essex University's Prof Lorna Woods, the lowest level of views that can be prosecuted in British criminal law are those deemed ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". These are concepts that few people without a law degree could easily define, let alone agree upon. It is the job of the police initially, but ultimately the courts, to try to nail that particular piece of jelly to the wall. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg says the the UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries on free speech The UK is ""out of whack"" with other countries, according to Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who later became right-hand man to Zuckerberg. He believes the UK needs to ""think long and hard"" about ""whether we've overdone it"" on policing speech. ""Surely part of the definition of being in a free society is people say ghastly things, offensive things, awful things, ugly things, and we don't sweep them under the carpet,"" he has said. Free speech versus 'me speech' What the British public want is another story. Earlier this month, in a survey by YouGov, 5,035 British adults were asked what was most important when it came to online behaviour: 28% said it was that people were able to express themselves freely but 61% prioritised keeping them safe from threats and abuse. ""People tend to prefer safety to free speech [online],"" argues Anthony Wells, a director at YouGov. What's more, there seems to be a generational divide. Mark Kerrison / Getty Images and SOPA Images / Getty Images In a new YouGov survey, 61% of Britons said keeping people safe online was more important than absolute free speech In my conversations with young people in their 20s and 30s - the age of my own children - I often hear the view that far from being an ideal to be strived for, free speech is the cause of much of the anger, division and fear they live with every day. In recent years a ""cancel culture"" has emerged in which those with ""unacceptable"" views can be hounded out of their jobs, no platformed as speakers or intimidated as students. Even back in 2021, a YouGov poll of Britons found that a majority of those surveyed - some 57% - had sometimes stopped themselves from expressing political or social views because of the fear of being judged or negative responses. For those who believe that free speech is under threat in the country, these figures can be used as evidence that decades of political correctness has had a chilling effect on people's ability to express their opinions. ""Our definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and I think a very broadened definition of what constitutes harm, is meaning that people feel like they are walking on eggshells and they're frightened - not just that they'll have the police around, but that they'll be cancelled if they say the wrong thing,"" the former Brexit Party MEP Baroness Claire Fox told the BBC's The World Tonight. But dig deeper and this debate, like so much else, is also about politics and the deepening and, increasingly, angry and violent divisions in our society. What can America teach us? Even with its constitutional protection for free speech, plenty in the UK question what basis Americans have to lecture Britain on free speech, given the arguments they are having back at home. The anger and division sparked by the assassination of the conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk in Utah this month ramped up the debate further on that side of the Atlantic over where the boundaries should lie between what is offensive, hateful and dangerous. Michael Le Brecht/Disney via Getty Images ABC has suspended talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel over comments about the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi appalled many conservatives when she declared that, ""There's free speech and then there's hate speech"". It seemed to take her into precisely the territory, which has caused so many problems here in the UK. President Trump himself has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15bn (£11bn) over what he calls defamation and libel, adding to the long list of media outlets he has taken to the courts over stories - the newspaper has called it ""intimidation tactics"" - and he celebrated the sacking of the late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as ""great news for America"". The US historian Tim Snyder, who is an outspoken public critic of the direction America is heading under Trump believes that free speech should be distinguished from what he calls ""me speech"". Win McNamee/Getty Images Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times for $15 billion ""Me speech is a common practice among rich and influential Americans,"" writes Mr Snyder. ""Practitioners of me speech use the phrase free speech quite a bit. ""But what they mean is free speech for themselves. They want a monopoly on it. ""They believe that they are right about everything, and so they should always have giant platforms, in real life or on social media. ""The people with whom they disagree, however, should be called out and intimidated in an organised way on social media, or subjected to algorithmic discrimination so that their voices are not heard."" As much about listening This issue is one I've felt strongly about for as long as I can remember. My grandparents knew first hand what it was to be persecuted for who you were and what you thought or said. They were German Jews who fled the Nazis for what then was the relative security of China and later had to flee the Communists there. As a child, I recall watching in reverential silence as each day, after lunch, my grandfather held a huge radio on his lap and turned the dial, skipping stations until he found the BBC World Service. There, he had learned, he would find news he could trust and speech which was free of political control. So important was this to him that he had risked hiding with his wife and daughter (my mother) in a cupboard in their home in Shanghai to listen to it on a banned shortwave radio. Nick says he finds it hard to accept comparisons between the UK and a dictatorship That is why I find any comparison between the UK and a dictatorship a little hard to swallow. What I learned as the grandchild of those who had fled not one but two murderous ideologies was that free speech was about listening as much as talking. What mattered above all else is being able to hear both sides of an argument and learn the facts behind them - without having that information controlled by governments, rich and powerful media owners, or anyone else.

d85289a2b48f,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",,"Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping ""How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy"" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's ""get back in charge week"" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. Arron Chown/ PA Both Rayner's team and No 10 felt she had to go In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called ""Mr Rules"" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. Jane Barlow/ PA Rayner had styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the ""service of the people"", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, ""it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight"". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. ""There's just the smell test,"" a Labour insider said. Chris Jackson / PA Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves all came under fire for accepting  permitted freebies This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. Getty Images Nigel Farage moved forward his conference speech after Rayner's resignation The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock David Lammy is the new deputy prime minister The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: ""None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership."" You and I might translate that as: ""The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway."" One insider described it as moving those who were ""a bit awkward, or a bit tired"". Aaron Chown/ PA Some hope Shabana Mahmood will take a more strident approach on small boats as the new home secretary What those changes add up to depends on who you ask. One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle ""is all about immigration"", believing ""Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this"" to solve the small boats issue or ""we're all done for"". Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system. As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings. But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper. Andy Rain/ EPA /Shutterstock Yvette Cooper will have to contend with a visit from President Donald Trump within days of taking up the foreign brief Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job. I wouldn't bet we'll see her meeting JD Vance in waders any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days. Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that. Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry. He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical. Phil Noble / Reuters Angela Rayner's exit from government has brought on a change in the prime minister's top team But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves. This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition. His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the ""time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long"", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck. Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: ""I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions."" This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for. ""Phase 2"" was meant to be ""delivery, delivery, delivery"". Another bout of political jargon that followed, ""change"", ""renewal"", ""security"", ""fairness"", ""milestones"", ""first steps"", you get the point. Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing. ""You can see the problem from Mars,"" another party insider says, ""there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything"", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week. But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work. And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement. House of Common / UK Parliament/ PA The start of Sir Keir Starmer's phase two of government has not quite gone to plan Seven days ago there was an ambition that week one of ""phase two"" might be an orderly start to the term. The Rayner saga skewered that plan. Now with his new chosen team in place there is more opportunity to make things work perhaps, but fewer excuses if things go wrong. A senior party source told me: ""The test is how does the PM show how No 10's capacity for political strategy and policy making have materially changed?"" With a long list of problems and the party conference looming, we'll soon know if Downing Street can pass that test, to prove it can manage the many challenges of ""phase two"" any better than the agonies of year one.

1fc83dede9b6,Clashes erupt between Hamas forces and armed clan members in Gaza City,,"At least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave. Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said. A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in ""an armed assault by a militia"". Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched. Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. ""This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,"" one resident said. ""They were running from their own people."" The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past. The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that ""any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance"" would be dealt with firmly. Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes. Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them. However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack. The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying ""fighters in the streets"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5e551j593o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0295/live/f94c5e30-a796-11f0-8c9e-87f67f3eb58c.jpg,2025-10-12T18:32:42.203000+00:00,991c93cae6793ef0c66882caf8e48dacfd70111d
a5ed8b4e7e92,Afghan Taliban says Pakistani troops killed in 'retaliatory' border attacks,,"Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected. Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands. At a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded. He added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured. Pakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and ""affiliated"" fighters was in the hundreds. Afghanistan’s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that ""we have no problems"" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added ""there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation."" Pakistan's interior minister said he ""strongly condemns"" the Taliban's attacks: ""The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws. ""Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,"" he said in a post on X. The two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties. Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha. A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT). He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border. Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's ""sovereign territory"" , as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday. Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed. A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a ""base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan"". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this. The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago. ""Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,"" Naqvi warned. In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul. Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to ""prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmzmn4971zo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c057/live/818d4a50-a753-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T11:58:23.238000+00:00,abb20d3d2a27bf678c6db52dda6479bdab334403
2183711189cc,Madagascar presidency says attempt to seize power under way,,"Madagascar presidency says attempt to seize power under way Sammy Awami reporting from Madagascar and Farouk Chothia AFP via Getty Images Some troops joined protesters in the capital on Saturday The office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has said an attempt to seize power illegally and by force is under way in the country. Hours later, an army unit known as CAPSAT claimed that it had taken over the leadership of the military command, and was now in control of all the armed forces - land, air, and naval. This is the same unit that played a crucial role in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which helped Rajoelina rise to power. Madagascar was first hit by youth-led protests on 25 September against water and power cuts, but they have escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis. Rajoelina's whereabouts are unclear, but in a statement he said ""there is an attempt to seize power at this time in the territory of the Republic, in complete violation of the Constitution and democratic principles,"" in a translation. He condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called an attempt to destabilise the country. He also called on all of the nation's key forces to unite in defending the constitutional order and national sovereignty. CAPSAT said it had appointed a new army chief of staff, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, according to a statement issued on its Facebook page. AFP news agency reports armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo has accepted the appointment. ""I give him my blessing,"" the minister was quoted as saying at a ceremony to install Gen Pikulas to the post. Protesters have gathered at the main square in the capital, Antananarivo, for the second consecutive day. This is a significant development, as they had failed to reach May 13 Square, the focal point of previous uprisings, until now. A protester told the BBC that they had ""finally conquered May 13 Square - the Square of Democracy"". ""We're happy and relieved. It's a great victory. We won't stop the struggle until President Rajoelina resigns,"" the protester added. Protesters have been celebrating their success in reaching the main square in Antananarivo The success of the demonstrators came after they received unexpected support from CAPSAT on Saturday, when some of its troops left their barracks to join the demonstration. CAPSAT had condemned the use of force against protesters by other security units. There were reports of a shoot-out at a CAPSAT camp on Sunday, following similar reports on Saturday. CAPSAT said one soldier was shot by gendarmes on Saturday, and died. Air France said it had suspended its flights to Antananarivo until at least Tuesday because of the security situation. The African Union said it was deeply concerned by the latest developments in Madagascar, and urged sides to resolve the crisis through dialogue. The protest movement, known as Gen Z Mada, has been rallying support mainly through social media, posing the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his re-election in 2023. Some of the protesters have been wearing T-shirts and holding banners with a symbol - a skull with a straw hat from the Japanese manga series ""One Piece"" - used by youth-led demonstrators in other countries, including Indonesia and Peru. On Saturday, a statement from the presidency had assured the nation that Rajoelina and the new prime minister - an army general he appointed last week - were in control of the situation. AFP via Getty Images Some soldiers left their barracks to throw their weight behind the protest movement UN human rights chief Volker Türk previously urged security forces to stop using ""unnecessary and disproportionate force"" to quell the unrest. He said at least 22 people were killed and 100 others injured. Rajoelina disputed the figure last week, saying there were 12 confirmed deaths and ""all of these individuals were looters and vandals"". Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power. Rajoelina governed for four years and then returned to power after the 2018 election. Despite its natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. Only about one-third of Madagascar's 30 million people have access to electricity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

fd4987eaf20c,"'In an instant, they were gone' - small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast",,"'In an instant, they were gone' - small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu Bucksnort, Tennessee BBC Mourners gather for a vigil at the Maple Valley Baptist Church in Tennessee in memory of 16 people presumed dead after a blast at an explosives factory In Bucksnort, Tennessee, residents have spent a chilly autumn night heeding a simple message spraypainted on a concrete barrier by the side of the road: ""Pray for the AES families"". Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead. This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is ""not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,"" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as ""It Is Well With My Soul"". ""It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions"". A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads ""Pray for AES families"". Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls. ""They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,"" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. ""We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,"" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed. Her friend was ""full of life"", Ms Newcombe said. ""She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,"" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her. Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers. The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway. But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy. ""At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,"" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. ""We are dealing with remains."" Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days. Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedy Tiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for. ""Everybody knows everybody here,"" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. ""With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family."" ""There's probably never gonna be any answers"" to the tragedy, she said. Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. ""They were loved by their families and by the community,"" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. ""It's just a sad, sad day,"" she said. Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends. A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25. The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this. In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions. Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy. ""One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8y0rnw2eo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ba74/live/b3b26eb0-a790-11f0-a1b6-8f14656a6062.jpg,2025-10-12T17:52:14.943000+00:00,dd69518b6afe54229e240a6b8ddcde838384df77

The US embassy in Mali said on Friday the fee had been introduced to reinforce Washington's ""commitment to protecting America's borders and safeguarding US national security"". Mali's foreign ministry said on Sunday the bond had been imposed unilaterally, and it had decided to ""establish an identical visa programme"" for US citizens. The visa policy shift comes despite moves to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries. In July, US officials visited Mali to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and economic partnerships, including potential access to Mali's gold and lithium reserves. Relations deteriorated after a coup in Mali in 2021 led to Gen Assimi Goïta sweeping to power. He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.

Herminie gained 52.7% of the vote, compared with Ramkalawan's 47.3%. In his victory speech, Herminie promised to lower the cost of living, revive public services, and unite the island nation, saying the result marked ""a new chapter for all Seychellois"". After losing his bid for a second term, Ramkalawan congratulated Herminie on his victory, saying he leaves ""a legacy that makes many presidents blush"". The election went to a run-off after neither candidate won an outright majority in the first round two weeks ago. A former parliamentary speaker, Herminie was charged with witchcraft in 2023 in what he said was a politically motivated attempt to thwart his presidential ambitions. The charges were dropped in 2024, paving the way for him to run for office. ""I will be the president of all Seychellois, and I will end divisions by ceasing preferences and giving everyone the opportunity to thrive,"" Herminie said in his victory speech. Ramkalawan is the latest incumbent to lose elections in Africa, with Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera voted out of power last month amid growing discontent with the rising cost of living. Herminie's party, United Seychelles (US), won parliamentary elections with a solid majority last month, regaining control after previously losing it to Rakalawan's Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS).

47931edd9c06,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC",,"We're grateful for what Trump is doing for peace, Nobel winner tells BBC Norberto Paredes BBC Mundo and Alex Boyd Watch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBC Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing ""around the world for peace"". Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate. She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him ""how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy"". Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended . Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the ""Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace"". Machado said she was ""very glad"" to speak to the US president and was ""able to convey to him our appreciation"". The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as ""one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times"". Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"". He added: ""Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions."" Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country. Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González. When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest. Machado told BBC Mundo her award was ""like an injection"" for her political movement. ""It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,"" she added. ""The democrats around the world share our struggle."" She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela. ""The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,"" Machado told the BBC. ""And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities. ""We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror. ""So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls. ""And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now."" Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs. It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in ""narco-trafficking"". They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law. On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was ""Colombian with Colombian citizens inside"", an allegation the White House called ""baseless"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8y25l250o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/87d5/live/9f59bf00-a6d1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-11T18:51:32.916000+00:00,82f03af0d87b6542747f750ed9ab7540afdc69b9

Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages ""are coming home"" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible. In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war. More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday. Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday. Three members of Qatar's top administrative body - the Amiri Diwan - died in a car crash near Sharm El-Sheikh, the Qatari embassy in Egypt said on Sunday. Qatar has been mediating in the Gaza crisis. Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive. A top Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told AFP news agency that ""according to the signed agreement, the prisoner exchange is set to begin on Monday morning as agreed, and there are no new developments on this matter"". He said Hamas militants on the ground had not yet notified the movement's leadership about the logistics of the handover. Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: ""It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives. ""My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,."" Reuters Crowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising Trump Shulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. ""They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,"" Shulamit said. Many in the crowd yelled ""Thank you, Trump!"" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner. ""He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,"" David said. In Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans. Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed. ""There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,"" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City. Watch: Palestinians crowd around trucks to grab aid in Khan Younis Raja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone. ""I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,"" she said. Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had ""not yet"" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily. With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations. A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine. Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel.

e9c1834d9633,Hamas mobilises fighters in Gaza as fears of internal violence mount,,"Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing. The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to ""cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel"" and told fighters to report within 24 hours. Reports from Gaza suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying ""fighters in the streets"". Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence. Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas. Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives. This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30. Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years. The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends. This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm. A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: ""We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues."" A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. ""Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,"" he told the BBC. ""Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. ""This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population."" Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation. ""There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,"" he said. He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under. ""I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,"" he said. These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8482418plo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28d5/live/6f84f470-a6ae-11f0-b55a-e7725355d83f.jpg,2025-10-11T14:44:59.836000+00:00,8845e626b85ca6e983ff67c3764e679dedaf6ee2

Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April. Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday. The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier. She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries. ""The police caught him with it and charged him,"" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military. ""I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,"" Ms Hasina said. In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army , Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment. He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September. The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added. The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/Facebook Mr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year later On Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives. ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an ""average student"" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. ""Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,"" said  Kasam Sumra. ""We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work."" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing. In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army. The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine. ""We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,"" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.

aae9e75b0ed3,Drone strike in besieged Sudan city kills dozens,,"Dozens of people have been killed in a drone strike at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, a besieged Sudanese city on the brink of collapse, activists said. The resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. The RSF has denied it carried out the strike. ""Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,"" a statement from the group said. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble. Sudan Doctors Network said 57 people were killed in the drone attack, including 17 children, and 17 were injured. Activists said at least 60 people had been killed. Hospitals already struggling under months of siege have been overwhelmed, with doctors treating the wounded on floors and in corridors. The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in el-Fasher has ""gone beyond disaster and genocide"", the resistance group said. Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises. The army controls most of the north and the east. El-Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by the army and its allies. The RSF also controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. If el-Fasher falls the RSF will control the entire Darfur region, where they hope to form an alternative government. In recent weeks, the RSF has intensified its assault on el-Fasher, leading experts to believe the city could soon fall unless the army receives immediate reinforcements. Research showed the RSF had finished building an earthen wall around el-Fasher, bolstering their siege and making it even harder for civilians to escape. The UN said there were 250,000 civilians trapped in el-Fasher, and warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may amount to war crimes. Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies. Two days ago, at least 13 people were killed after the RSF shelled one of the last remaining hospitals in el-Fasher.

9efd9c3ec3cc,Biden receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer,,"Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said. The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details. The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News. In May, Biden's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease , which had spread to his bones. The discovery came after the Democratic politician reported urinary symptoms that led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that ""he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone"". ""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management."" A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. A person close to Biden has said the former president is doing well and responding to treatment, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported, with another source telling the outlet that the radiation started ""a few weeks ago"" in Philadelphia. Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign. His former Vice-President, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrats' presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump. For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research. In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the ""cancer moonshot"" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047. Biden lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. The former president and vice-president has also been treated twice for skin cancer, in 2023 and 2025. In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was ""difficult"". Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It says age is the most common risk factor.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ede670jnyo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3846/live/3e341bf0-a6b1-11f0-90fd-c3777763571c.jpg,2025-10-11T21:23:28.176000+00:00,55cdc73bb3d12703454ec48e0545097bd61e7527
807991331fd7,Anger after female journalists excluded from Afghan embassy event in India,,"Indian politicians and journalists have criticised the government for failing to speak out after female journalists were excluded from a press event with the Afghan Taliban foreign minister in Delhi. Around 16 male reporters were selected to attend a forum on Friday with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy. Journalists observed women and foreign media being turned away. India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it ""had no involvement in the press interaction"" at the Afghan embassy. A source in the Taliban government admitted women had not been invited to attend. They told the BBC ""female journalists were excluded due to lack of proper coordination and will be invited to next conference if held in Delhi"". Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them"". The Editors Guild of India strongly condemned the exclusion and said: ""Whether or not the MEA coordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection."" It called for India's government to ""publicly reaffirm that press access at diplomatic events held in India must respect gender equity"". Muttaqi is in India for a week of high-level talks with the government. On Friday, he met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would re-open its embassy in Kabul. It was shut after the Taliban returned to power. Since 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law which have severely impacted the rights of Afghan women and girls. Following the men-only press event, Rahul Gandhi said on social media: ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space."" Indian politician Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked Modi to clarify his position on ""the removal of female journalists"" from the gathering. She asked how ""this insult to some of India's most competent women"" had been allowed in ""a country whose women are its backbone and its pride"". Others expressed shock and said the men who went to the event should have walked out in solidarity with their female colleagues. ""Why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?"" wrote politician Mahua Moitra on social media. She added: ""Government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing  Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqgl2dxweo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/74b8/live/53296ef0-a6ae-11f0-b55a-e7725355d83f.jpg,2025-10-11T15:20:23.457000+00:00,ddb458c9fc8850d2f9c4e091328e35fe17130566
389f3c0aa25c,Hamas presses Israel to free prominent prisoners as part of Gaza deal,,"Hamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza. Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance. Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them. It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza. It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown. Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained. Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat. Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders. Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an ""illegal terrorist organisation"" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001. Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s. According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad. The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October. Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure. In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return. The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory. Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

It will also spend $4.5bn buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets from the US, bringing its total fleet of such advanced planes to 43. ""With this... agreement we significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces in the region,"" Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Friday. The Arctic is at a critical crossroads between North America, Russia and the rest of Europe. The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance. ""The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,"" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were. Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar. Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland. In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. Greenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility. US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are ""all over the place"". Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was ""critical"" for national and economic security.

The desert's extreme aridity makes it one of the clearest places on Earth to view the night sky and is famous for being home to the largest radio telescope in the world. But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months. This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life. The Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year. But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day. The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June. AFP via Getty Images/Jose Torres This magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November. Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.

She made the announcement on Friday, saying that after an ""open channel of communication"" with Putin, Ukranian children displaced in the war had been reunited with families. The First Lady's ""peace letter"" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August. President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so ""will do more than serve Russia alone"" and ""will serve humanity itself"". ""Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,"" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House. ""Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine."" Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting. Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says. The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the ""identities and circumstances"" of each child. The US government ""confirmed the facts"", she said. Mrs Trump said she has ""learned a lot about this matter"" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: ""Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger."" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally. Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was ""a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children"".

210d1709a095,'We are inventing captivity medicine': Hospital prepares for freed Israeli hostages,,"'We are inventing captivity medicine': Hospital prepares for freed Israeli hostages BBC Dr Steinman says working at the unit has taught her the ""strength of the human spirit"" When the first hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, taken into Israel and transferred by helicopter to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Dr Michal Steinman will take them up to the sixth floor, swipe open the glass door and see them reunite with their closest family after more than 700 days in captivity. ""It is a privilege,"" says the head of nursing. ""These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values – as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli."" Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital. It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating. ""There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,"" said Dr Steinman told the BBC. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says. The first is to be ""a medical detective"", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity. With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, ""they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand"". They also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks. ""Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,"" she said. ""We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things."" Reuters It's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo) The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff. But there is also a ""do not disturb"" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's. ""You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,"" says Dr Steinman. ""Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility."" Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly. Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics – of when to speak and when not to, she says. ""The most important thing is what we're not saying,"" she says. ""Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence."" But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. ""We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story."" Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside world The staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment ""when the real world comes in"". The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures. ""Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no."" For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable. ""You should see my WhatsApp messages,"" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit. ""You gain hope again,"" she says.

a07a73683fb9,How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas,,"How the autumn climbing season turned deadly in the Himalayas Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Getty Images The autumn hiking season is increasingly seeing extreme weather Clear skies, calm winds and a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks draped in snow - that is the autumn hikers on Mount Everest have come to love. But that seems to be changing. The monsoon now stretches into autumn, the traditional season for mountain tourism, meteorologists say, making weather more unpredictable. For the past decade, they have recorded at least one episode of extreme rainfall almost every year during the tail end of this longer monsoon - and in the mountains it is becoming quite dangerous. Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest for days in freezing temperatures at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). Nearly 600 trekkers were guided to safety by the end of Tuesday, Chinese state media said. One person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, but the others were reportedly in good condition. This was on the Tibetan side but something similar had unfolded on the Nepal side, where a South Korean mountaineer died on Mera Peak. The world found out much later because communication lines were hit by torrential rains and heavy snowfall. Officials estimate that landslides and flash floods in the country have killed around 60 people over the past week. This is highly unusual for October ""when we expect the skies to remain clear,"" said Riten Jangbu Sherpa, a mountain guide, adding that trekkers have been increasingly caught in unexpected extreme weather in recent years. Given this is the favoured season, frequent storms like this have ""hampered our trekking and mountaineering business,"" he added. The monsoon season in northern India and Nepal usually lasts from June to mid- September, but not anymore. ""Our data shows that most of the years in the past decade have had monsoons lasting until the second week of October, which is definitely a change,"" said Archana Shrestha, deputy director general at Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. More worrying is the heavy rain and snow the tail end of the season brings, like it did this time on 4 and 5 October - Ms Shreshtha described the pattern as ""damaging precipitation in a short span of time"". High in the Himalayas, such extreme weather means blizzards and snowstorms, which is a huge risk for trekking, mountaineering and tourism. Reuters A snowstorm this month trapped hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest That's what happened last weekend when the weather changed quite suddenly - the winds began howling, temperatures plummeted and visibility dropped drastically. The road that had comfortably brought the hikers to what should have been a stunning pitstop was now buried in snow and impossible to traverse. On Cho Oyu, another mountain which stands between China and Nepal, a team of climbers on the 8,201m peak retreated temporarily as snow fell unabated. ""Now they are back after the heavy snowfall ended,"" said expedition operator Mingma Sherpa, whose team has six members. But for hikers trapped near the eastern face of Everest, the return was much dicier. Some told the BBC they battled hypothermia despite being dressed warmly while trudging along deep snow. Others said they didn't sleep for fear of being buried in the snow, which was falling so heavily that they spent most of their time clearing it. It could have ended tragically had it not been for a well-coordinated rescue, with yaks and horses deployed to clear the snow. Still, one trekker, who had hiked up these mountains more than a dozen times, told the BBC he had ""never experienced weather like this"". One big driver is the higher amount of moisture in the air because of how the world has been warming, scientists say. That has led to torrential rains over a short span of time, often after a prolonged dry spell – unlike in the past when monsoon showers were spread evenly over four months. ""The weather at this time of the year has been changing every year in recent years, we can't promise our clients anything,"" said Passang, a travel agent in the Tibetan capital Lhasa. ""September, October used to be peak season with pleasant weather but these days we see extreme weather all of a sudden and the temperature drops so quickly."" Getty Images Landslides and flash floods in Nepal over the past week have killed dozens A turbocharged monsoon Weather experts say the monsoons in South Asia at times appear to have become stronger because they are increasingly coming into contact with another weather system, the westerly disturbance. This is a low pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and travels east - it carries cold air that brings rains and occasionally snow to northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. But when it meets air that is warmer and wetter - which is what happens during the monsoon - the result can lead to more extreme weather. Put simply, westerly disturbances can ""effectively turbocharge the monsoon"", said Akshay Deoras, a weather scientist at the University of Reading in the UK. The reason this is happening more often is that these weather systems have traditionally been a winter phenomenon, arriving between December and March in  northern India and the Himalayas. But now, meteorologists say, they are frequently arriving earlier, during monsoon and autumn. The deluge of rain and snow in eastern Nepal, where Everest is located, in early October was also because of the westerly disturbance, officials at Nepal's meteorology department said. They added that the westerly disturbance had fuelled a low-pressure system (a part of the tail end of monsoon) from the Bay of Bengal, pushing the clouds eastwards when in fact they should have moved west. Scientists have also found that in a warming world, the growing interaction between westerly disturbances and monsoons is producing another unusual result. The warmer air is pushing the clouds higher, which means these weather systems are now able to cross the Himalayas and reach Tibet and other areas that did not see so much rain before. A study published in the journal Nature in June notes that ""the warming climate and the interaction between the westerly and the Indian monsoon are making the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau change into a warming and wetting climate"". The Tibetan plateau has always been home to a dry climate. And scientists say a warm, wet Tibet could mean unstable weather and frequent snowstorms and blizzards. ""What's changed is the reliability of patterns; we can't assume that conditions will behave the same from season to season,"" said Logan Talbott, chief guide with Alpenglow Expeditions that brings climbers to the Tibet side of Everest each year. ""That means flexible scheduling, real-time decision-making, and experienced leadership [in the Himalayas] have become even more important.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jwgnwmezo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99f9/live/db61de90-a5c5-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-11T22:17:35.335000+00:00,7ac0e47f9b543151ee2303f634fb7161d7ec32ba
eb7cb47f2d9c,South Africa debates changing name of world-famous Kruger park,,"South Africa debates changing name of world-famous Kruger park Khanyisile Ngcobo Johannesburg Corbis via Getty Images A bust of Paul Kruger stands at one of the gates to the national park that bears his name South Africa's world-famous Kruger National Park could become known by a new name if some local politicians have their way. The vast wildlife sanctuary, called the Sabi Game Reserve at the time, was re-christened in 1926 to honour Paul Kruger. He was president in the late 19th Century of what was known as the South African Republic, which forms part of what is now the east of South Africa. For Afrikaners, descendants of 17th Century European settlers, Kruger is revered as a hero who led the resistance against British colonialism. But for the majority of South Africans, he is viewed as a relic of the country's racist past, as he was one of those responsible for driving black Africans off their land and excluding them from having a say in running the republic. Many South African cities, towns, roads and other major infrastructure have been given new names since the end of the legalised system of racial discrimination, known as apartheid, and the beginning of the democratic era in 1994. Though sometimes controversial, the decisions have been justified as a way to break with what went before – both the apartheid and colonial era. But the proposed Kruger name-change does not just touch on history, it also could have a bearing on the country's fragile economy. AFP via Getty Images Tourists go to the park in their hundreds of thousands every year to view the wildlife on offer The national park, home to elephants, lions, hippos, leopards and many other animals, attracts almost a million visitors a year, and is a jewel in the crown of South Africa's tourism industry. Some argue that changing Kruger's name could threaten that. Part of the park is in Mpumalanga province and in September, as the country celebrated Heritage Month, representatives from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) put forward a proposal in the region's legislature to change Kruger's name. ""How do we celebrate our heritage as South Africans when we still have our beautiful national parks named after the architect of apartheid Paul Kruger,"" EFF representative Rhulani Qhibi was quoted as saying in a stirring speech. While not historically accurate, as apartheid in its legal form was introduced decades after Kruger's death, the rhetoric reflects the way he is viewed by some. The EFF also proposed the renaming of other key landmarks in the province, including the Kruger Mpumalanga International airport. But in their haste to remove Kruger's association with the park, the EFF, whose national leader is the firebrand MP Julius Malema , put forward another problematic name: Skukuza. Skukuza, which means ""he who sweeps clean"" in the Tsonga language, was the nickname given to the park's first warden, James Stevenson-Hamilton, who was known for driving out poachers and black communities that lived in the park in its early days, among other things. The EFF leader in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe, was quoted in South African publication Sunday World as admitting the party's blunder. ""We are still engaging with the land claimants at Kruger National Park and the people who were staying there because they said Skukuza is not the right name. He was the man who kicked them out of the park,"" Sedibe said. Gallo Images via Getty Images The Paul Kruger statue in Pretoria has sometimes attracted the ire of protesters - it was daubed with red paint in 2020 Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum condemned the EFF's proposal as ""cheap politics and proof that political power-hunger in the province outweighs informed or responsible decision-making"". The group vowed to mount legal challenges to any attempts to rename the park without due process and blasted the EFF for criticising its namesake. ""The Kruger National Park was created thanks to Kruger's vision [and] to ignore Kruger's contribution to the establishment of the country's most important national park... is opportunistic and blatantly spreading lies,"" AfriForum's Marais de Vaal said in reaction to the news. The motion to change the name was adopted by the provincial legislature after receiving support from its largest parties, the African National Congress (ANC), which is in power nationally, and uMkhonto weSizwe. Despite it not being legally binding, as there is a national process that any name change needs to go through, detractors have warned that if approved it could damage the tourism sector, which contributes almost 9% to the country's economy. It could have ""severe consequences... it might even dilute the international recognition of this park and South Africa as a tourism destination that we've built over so many years"", tourism expert Prof Elmarie Slabbert told the BBC. There would also be the cost of having to rebrand the park. The academic, a research director at the North West University's school of tourism management, did acknowledge ""that we need to honour indigenous heritage"". ""But the effect on the economy is going to be so significant that we need to decide where do we spend our money. We've got such a high unemployment rate at this point in time that I believe that is where the money should go."" More than 30% of the working-age population are unemployed - ranked by the World Bank as one of the worst jobless rates of any nation – and youth unemployment is even higher. But economics is not the only basis on which name-change decisions have been made. The need to address the inequities of the country's past has been seen as vital. Getty Images The Indian Ocean city of Gqeberha was known as Port Elizabeth until 2021 For instance, the name of former Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, a key figure in implementing apartheid, has been removed from many places. Other changes include the city of Port Elizabeth. Named after the wife of a 19th Century British official, it is now called Gqeberha, the Xhosa word for the river that runs through it. King William's Town, after William IV, is now Qonce, also referring to a river. Johannesburg's international airport, once known as Jan Smuts – honouring a former prime minister – is now called OR Tambo, after the anti-apartheid leader and former president of the ANC. Some cities, like the capital, Pretoria, have kept their monikers but the local government areas under which they come have been renamed. Plenty of other renaming ideas have been floated, including changing the name of the Eastern Cape seaside town of Port Alfred, which commemorates Queen Victoria's second son. Some have even suggested changing the country's name to Azania. Many of these proposals have divided public opinion, and to ensure that changes are not just made on a whim there is an extensive legal process that needs to be completed. It is managed by the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC) and begins with an application either by individuals, communities or institutions to the body's provincial branch. The proposal is discussed and could lead to a public consultation. Once this has been concluded, the name-change plan is sent to the national office. If it is thought to satisfy ""all the requirements"", a recommendation will then be made to the sports, arts and culture minister for a final decision, SAGNC chairperson Dr Nkadimeng Mahosi told the BBC. ""What is happening here [in Mpumalanga's legislature], does not go according to what the national act says… [and] is political point-scoring,"" he said. As a national landmark, and the fact that different government departments will need to have a say, Kruger is a unique case, Dr Mahosi added. There are then several bureaucratic hurdles that need to be negotiated before the name Kruger ever disappears from tourism brochures. But the debate has revealed the sensitivities that continue to exist around how to deal with the country's past and the legacy of those who used to govern it.

Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Europe, Kang explained that while there was ""nothing official we can talk about"", she and co-director Chris Appelhans believe ""there's definitely more we can do with these characters in this world"". ""And whatever it will be, it will be a story that deserves to be a sequel, and it will be something that we want to see,"" she added. Kpop Demon Hunters has become a cultural phenomenon this year, overtaking Squid Game as the most watched title in Netflix history, with more than 325m views. Getty The directors of Kpop Demon Hunters, Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang The animated film tells the story of a hugely successful female Kpop trio, who play enormous concerts at the same time as trying to save the world from evil forces. They end up locked in battle against a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons. The film has broken record after record. A sing-a-long version released in cinemas in August became the first ever Netflix film to top the US box office. Its music also topped the US singles and albums charts, becoming the first soundtrack in history to have four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, something not even Saturday Night Fever could achieve. The film's anthem Golden, sung by Huntr/x, has spent eight weeks at number one, tying Sugar Sugar by The Archies for the most time at the top of the charts by an animated act. Could the Oscars go Golden? There is now a real belief that Kpop Demon Hunters could be set to slay the Oscars. Critics have loved the film, which holds a score of 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the online review aggregator. The influential Gold Derby predictions website now has it as the favourite for the best animated film , ahead of Zootopia 2 and Elio. ""The title alone is obviously Oscar bait,"" laughs Chris Appelhans, the American who is the other half of the directing duo. ""We tried to do something new and it was really hard and I think we're really proud of how it came out. But if people are going to reward that, that would be awesome."" The other category where the film should be a strong challenger is best original song, where the rules state that any film can only enter three numbers. Netflix Songs by both Hunter/x and the Saja Boys, the boyband populated by demons, could be nominated at the Oscars Netflix have already stated that breakout hit Golden will be included for Academy consideration, but what about the other two slots? ""I think Your Idol is such a banger,""  says Kang about song the Saja Boys sing while feeding the souls of their audience to the evil overlord Gwi-Ma. ""We're so proud of the song, but also the sequence. We cheered, we were so proud of it."" Appelhans, however, is team Huntr/x, opting for What it Sounds Like. ""The finale was such a technical challenge, both in songwriting and storytelling,"" he explains. ""To make a song that was the climax of your movie, with a lot of moving parts, but was also an actual cathartic song."" Kang concurs: ""It's the one song that every time I hear it, I just cry. It's very emotional."" ""No room for Soda Pop?"" I question about the Saja Boys earworm. ""Maybe we could get four?"" laughs Kang. ""We'll just submit then all,"" joins in Appelhans. Summer of success Appelhans can pin point the exact moment back in June when he realised they had a hit on their hands. ""It's literally 2am the night after the film came out. I'm on TikTok and in the comments section they are perfectly articulating Rumi's emotional journey."" He was overjoyed that the fans were already engaging with film's main protagonist, on a deep level. Kang, who was born in South Korea and moved to Canada aged five, places the breakthrough moment as slightly later. ""We were able to connect with our core audience, which is the KPop audience and the animation fans and that demographic took to our film very quickly. ""But it was the third week when the trajectory of the graph of viewership really changed. We were like, 'Woah. That was weird.' ""And we could see through our social media all the different pockets of demographic that were connecting to it."" Kang believes that the fans have been crucial in film's all conquering rise: ""They are an age group that loves to make content. And it was kind of like free advertising. They were just spreading the word of this movie everywhere. I think that helped it develop these long legs."" The film's success continues to grow. Four months after its release, it was still the most watched film in 19 countries last week, including the UK and US. The Kpop stars Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices for Huntr/x, have appeared on both Saturday Night Live (in a skit with Bad Bunny) and gave their first ever live performance of Golden on Jimmy Fallon's US chat show . ""We were so bummed that we weren't able to be there at Fallon,"" says Kang in a rare moment of non-total positivity. ""We were asleep in Paris. Just to see him speaking to our girls was so weird. It now feels more real than ever. I'm just so proud of them. Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images (L-R) Rei Ami, Audrey Nuna, and EJAY, who provide the singing voices of Huntr/x, were presented with a platinum disc by Fallon One thing the pair would like to clear up is that they do not believe that their film should be classified as anime. ""I don't think we are big enough anime fans to be that inspired from it,"" explains Kang. ""The anime we like are very old school, like Cowboy Bebop and Sailor Moon,"" referencing two Japanese TV shows which originated in the 90s. Appelhans agrees: ""I think it was a flavour. I think we were influenced by a lot of Korean film makers and k-dramas. It was part of a wide spectrum of tones that we wanted to hit, but not the dominant one."" No live action adaptation They are also quick to rule out rumours of a Kpop Demon Hunters live-action adaptation. Kang wants to kick that idea into the underworld: ""There's so many elements of the tone and the comedy that are so suited for animation,"" she says. ""It's really hard to imagine these characters in a live action world. It would feel too grounded. So totally it wouldn't work for me."" For Appelhans, it is an ill-conceived idea: ""One of the great things about animation is that you make these composites of impossibly great attributes. Rumi can be this goofy comedian and then singing and doing a spinning back-kick a second later and then freefalling through the sky. ""The joy of animation is how far you can push and elevate what's possible. I remember they adapted a lot of different animes and often times, it just feels a little stilted."" Ricky Midlesworth/ Netflix The speaking voices of Huntr/x: Ji-young Yoo (Zoey), Arden Cho (Rumi) and May Hong (Rumi) No matter what happens this awards season, Kang says their expectations for the film have already been more than surpassed. She surmises that the aim was ""to connect people and bring them to Kpop"". ""Just seeing people bond over this movie has been so wonderful,"" she reflects. ""So all the awards would be great, but I think we feel really incredible about what the movie has done already. So it feels like we've kind of won in a way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvzmyyzmpo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5227/live/940c9bf0-a5ea-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T23:04:33.226000+00:00,d6d3596d829dd145be3d399578b4390988e81ae2
e1f082bc59f6,Thirty belugas in Canada face being euthanised. Can they be saved?,,"Thirty belugas in Canada face being euthanised. Can they be saved? Watch: Drone video shows beluga whales at Marineland in Ontario For decades, Marineland was a destination for Canadian children and their parents who wanted an up-close look at ocean-life near Niagara Falls. But behind the aquatic-themed roller coasters and dolphin performances was a dark history of documented mistreatment of animals and lingering financial problems. Ontario's Animal Welfare Services has conducted multiple investigations over the past several years, visiting the park more than 200 times since 2020, according to CBC News. Amid financial struggles, the park has been trying to get permission to sell 30 beluga whales to China. When their permits were denied, the park said it may have to euthanise the whales. Now advocates, experts and officials are looking for ways to save the whales - though few agree on one solution, and some say Marineland's threats to kill its whales are all talk. Getty Images The massive aquatic park, started by John and Marie Holer in 1961, sits on over 1,000 acres (400 ha) of prime Ontario real estate. But what was once a beloved attraction with a catchy commercial jingle has faced growing scrutiny over its care for animals, which also included land animals like bears and elk. In 2019, Canada passed a bill making it illegal to hold a whale, dolphin or porpoise captive. The legislation created protections for any future animals, but not for the animals already in captivity, leaving little room for federal government involvement with the whales at Marineland. Criticisms of the park date back several years, and in 2020 Animal Welfare Services opened an investigation into the park. That investigation led to the provincial animal welfare agency declaring that all the park's marine life was under distress because of poor water quality. By 2024, after investing in new technology, the water quality had been improved, the provincial government told the Canadian Press news agency. But that same year, Marineland was found guilty, under Ontario's animal cruelty laws, of abusing and neglecting three young black bears who were kept in small enclosures with inadequate access to water for months. In total, twenty whales  - one orca and 19 belugas  - have died at Marineland since 2019, according to the Canadian Press. The company has said the animals were well treated, and the deaths were part of the natural life cycle. Park facing bankruptcy Attendance at the park has drastically declined, and this spring it did not open to tourists, as it usually did. Many assume bankruptcy is inevitable. ""Unfortunately, they're telling us they're burning the furniture to heat the house,"" Niagara Falls mayor Jim Diodati told Radio-Canada on Friday. ""There's no money."" Park officials say they cannot afford to continue caring for the animals, and so they must find them a new home. Marineland applied for a permit from the federal government to sell the whales to a theme park in Zhuhai, China. But Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson said the whales would face similarly substandard treatment as ""public entertainment"" in the Chinese park, and denied Marineland's request. A number of organizations agreed with Thompson that the park in Zhuhai was not a suitable option. Then last week, the park shocked many when it told the government it may have to  euthanise the whales. It has asked the Canadian government for funding to continue to care for the animals instead. A Marineland letter to the fisheries ministry, obtained by the BBC, said that whatever happens to the animals would be ""a direct consequence of the minister's decision"". That assertion was not well received by the government. ""The fact that Marineland has not planned for a viable alternative despite raising these whales in captivity for many years, does not place the onus on the Canadian government to cover your expenses,"" Thompson said in a letter to Marineland, obtained by the BBC. The current status of the whales remains unclear. Marineland did not respond to a BBC request for comment. But Phil Demers - who worked for 12 years as a senior trainer at  Marineland and has since become an outspoken critic - told the BBC that there were limited options, besides the one in China, that could take all 30 whales at one facility. He believes the best-case scenario for the whales is any option that gets them out of Marineland, quickly. Without China, he thinks the best possible outcome is a coalition of US facilities each taking a handful of whales. ""These animals need to be out of those waters, yesterday,"" Mr Demers said. AFP via Getty Images Protest outside Marineland in 2012 Clock ticking on finding whales new homes Others say the conditions warrant the provincial government stepping in and seizing the whales. Ontario can appoint inspectors to assume care of animals in distress and recover costs from the facility's owner, under the Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act. That is a first step many want to see Ontario Premier Doug Ford take. ""Premier Ford needs to realize whether he likes it or not, Ontario has primary jurisdiction over captive wildlife within the province's borders,"" Colin Saravanamuttoo, Executive Director of World Animal Protection Canada, said. ""This game of chicken between Marineland, the province and Ottawa is totally unacceptable – Premier Ford needs to step up, lead and stop passing the buck."" The Whale and Dolphin Conservation, an animal welfare organisation, also wrote to Ford asking him to commission independent veterinary assessments of each whale so ""that every individual receives a humane and compassionate outcome"". Ford's office did not return the BBC's request for comment. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation wants to see the whales sent to a sanctuary in Nova Scotia run by The Whale Sanctuary Project. But there are some caveats. Charles Vinick, Chief Executive Officer of the Whale Sanctuary, said that facility will not be ready until next summer and will only be able to take eight to ten of the whales. ""There is no open sanctuary who can accommodate them today or tomorrow,"" he said. For now, as options for how to save the whales continue to be discussed, there's widespread confidence that Marineland's talk of euthanasia is just talk. ""The whole threat of euthanasia is a bluster,"" Mr Demers, the former Marineland employee, said. But the clock is ticking to find a  solution that gives these animals a better, safer life. ""It's going to take more than one person, or one organization to provide these animals the quality life they deserve,"" Mr Vinick said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kn6x711y2o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d27/live/858e65d0-a6c7-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-11T23:23:30.899000+00:00,a72d9236130f41444c19da3b99d6dad048ad5fbf
29a4688abdb3,What does wording of Gaza ceasefire agreement tell us?,,"What does wording of Gaza ceasefire agreement tell us? Hugo Bachega Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and BBC Visual Journalism team Getty Images A ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump. The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media. It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose. Even its title, ""Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War"", leaves room for different interpretations. The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid. However, by highlighting ""Comprehensive end of Gaza war"", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war. This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume. This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting. Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. ""If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,"" he said. The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan. This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation. And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help. Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located. The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive. This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations. US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides. Next phase of deal unclear This deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help. Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting. What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyr8e0gl2o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fad/live/2ef94db0-a5fb-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-10T17:25:41.270000+00:00,824b5de6d8f88f9aa6dca1f0fc6d5a224753621e
7ea192d33038,'They treated us like animals' - Inside the epicentre of deportations in New York City,,"'They treated us like animals' - Inside the epicentre of deportations in New York City Kayla Epstein in New York City and Leire Ventas BBC News Mundo Getty Images Monica Moreta Galarza was thrown to the ground when her husband was arrested outside immigration court in New York City Monica Moreta Galarza felt relieved after her husband's routine immigration hearing at New York City's 26 Federal Plaza. A judge had ordered Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López to return to court in May, and she believed that meant a reprieve from his potential deportation to Ecuador. Instead, as soon as they stepped out of the courtroom with their children, she was torn from her husband's arms and thrown to the ground by immigration officers as they detained him. ""One of them charged at me so aggressively that I was terrified, and he ended up throwing me to the ground,"" Ms Moreta Galarza told BBC News Mundo in Spanish. ""They treated us like animals."" The incident, which has since gone viral, led to one immigration agent being temporarily suspended. But it is not an isolated occurrence. The BBC witnessed similar incidents at the court house, while others – including an aggressive encounter between Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the media – have sparked public outcry. ICE's operations inside the building have created a charged, tense environment, attorneys said. ""I would honestly sum it up as just traumatic,"" said Allison Cutler, a New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) attorney who works at 26 Federal Plaza. ""It's traumatic for the clients we're serving, for the families getting ripped apart."" Getty Images Federal immigration officers wearing masks and sunglasses detain a man who appeared for his hearing at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City on 30 July While many of the detentions at 26 Federal Plaza are swift and non-violent, reporters and lawyers have witnessed several chaotic episodes in recent weeks. On a Tuesday in late August, the BBC watched as a dozen officers waiting outside a courtroom descended on a man, two women and a small boy. They quickly detained the man, and a melee ensued as the group fought to stay together. The crying woman, clinging to the detained man, was wrenched away by a federal officer - who appeared to be the same man who pulled Ms Moreta Galarza from her husband - as the man was carted off. The judge closed the courtroom and, as a result, the BBC could not verify details of the case. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide details of the man's current status, but stated that the agency ""takes its responsibility to protect children seriously"". They added that ICE gives parents the option of being removed with their children or having them placed with a designated individual. After the images of the incident with Ms Moreta Galarza spread on social media, DHS reported that the officer involved in the incident had been disciplined. Then last week, immigration officers were captured on video shoving two journalists to the ground as they tried to document a possible detention. One of the journalists could not get up, and was transported to the hospital. ""Nothing like this has happened with journalists before,"" Olga Fedorova, the other photojournalist thrown to the floor, told the BBC. Ms Fedorova frequently reports from the building and said that before the incident, ""we were able to work with federal agents, around federal agents with no incidents 99% of the time"". DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC in a statement that officers were making an arrest when they were ""swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations"". Ms McLaughlin said that ""officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator"". Chaotic encounters with government officials have played out multiple times in the lower Manhattan building this year, as immigration courts become key sites of a mass deportation initiative ordered by the Trump administration. Half of the 3,320 immigrants ICE has detained in the New York City area between Trump's inauguration and the end of July were arrested at 26 Federal Plaza, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project. The numbers suggest the building's immigration courts and offices are a primary engine of the administration's deportation plans in America's biggest city. About three quarters of people arrested at 26 Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration did not have past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the Deportation Data Project numbers suggest. Officers routinely pull multiple detainees from their hearings, without giving them the chance to speak to lawyers. ""We've never seen anything like this,"" said Benjamin Remy, a NYLAG lawyer who spends several days a week working with immigrants at Federal Plaza. Many immigrants no longer show up to court, he said. At one August hearing, a man with a criminal record failed to appear. The judge therefore ordered him removed from the country and threw out his asylum case. His attendance may not have changed the outcome; immigration enforcement was assembled outside that courtroom as well. Non-citizens in the US without a visa or similar documentation have always been subject to removal, said Triciah Claxton, supervising attorney with Safe Passage, an immigration rights group focused on minors. ""There used to be a concentrated effort on those who might have had criminal histories or prior arrests,"" said Ms Claxton, whose clients mostly appear virtually to avoid detention. But now, she said, that net appears to have widened. ""You see a lot of people who are in the process - they have asylum claims pending, they have other forms of relief pending – are still being taken in,"" Ms Claxton said. Getty Images People wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the halls Legal experts say this is an abuse of the courts system and puts immigrants into an impossible position. If they turn up for court hearings, as they are instructed to do, they could be arrested. But if they skip their court date, a judge could automatically order their deportation. The government argues it has broad authority to detain people who are in the US illegally. The administration says it is removing dangerous criminals from the country, and the White House and Department of Homeland Security frequently tout the arrests and detentions of undocumented migrants with violent criminal histories. It says it makes arrests in immigration court for safety reasons. ""DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,"" an agency official said in a statement to BBC. A New York Times/Siena poll found that the majority of respondents, 54%, supported deporting people who are here illegally. Over half (51%) felt the government was targeting the right people. In the case of Rubén Abelardo Ortiz López, whose wife Ms Moreta Galarza was pushed to the floor, the government says he was a violent criminal, and that it was justified in arresting him at court. Ortiz López entered the country illegally on 20 March 2024 and was wanted after being arrested on 18 June for ""assault and criminal obstruction of airway or bloodstream"". ""President Trump and Secretary (of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem will not allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" the statement added. ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return."" But for Ms Moreta Galarza, the incident at the courthouse reminded her of the injustices she says she fled in her home country of Ecuador. ""I suffered a lot in my country. I had no protection and the authorities there didn't care,"" she tells BBC News Mundo. She adds that she never thought the same thing would happen to her in the US. ""It's very ugly. I feel like I'm worthless now.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rxrxd444o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c595/live/806bc710-a68a-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T00:35:36.624000+00:00,3c4803ac04acc76d441ec9cc5274541b42cbd410
5431c66225f0,Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters?,,"Can the world's oldest president keep his title and woo a nation of young voters? Paul Njie BBC Africa, Yaoundé AFP/Getty Images The world's oldest head of state - 92-year-old Paul Biya - has promised Cameroon's electorate ""the best is still to come"" as he seeks his eighth consecutive presidential term on Sunday. The nonagenarian has already been in power since 1982 - another seven-year mandate could see him rule for 50 years until he will be almost 100. He defied widespread calls to step down and has been criticised for only showing up for one rally, spending most of the campaign period on a 10-day private trip to Europe. A backlash over his reliance on an AI-generated campaign video, as his opponents actively wooed voters on the ground, saw him rush north on his return home. In the vote-rich city of Maroua on Tuesday he addressed crowds of his party supporters - reaching out in particular to women and young people, promising to prioritise their plight in his next mandate. ""I will keep my word,"" he insisted, urging them to ""give me your valuable support once again"". But political analyst Immanuel Wanah tells the BBC that Biya's primary focus since coming to power has been to stay in power, ""often at the expense of efforts to enhance the living conditions of the country's citizens"". It is a view echoed by Dr Tilarius Atia, another political analyst, who puts this survivalist mindset down to an abortive coup against Biya in 1984. It means that for the vast majority of the population, Biya is the only president they have known - more than 60% of Cameroon's 30 million people are below the age of 25. Young political activist Marie Flore Mboussi is desperate for ""new blood"" as she believes ""longevity in power inevitably leads to a kind of laziness"". ""After 43 years, the people are tired,"" she tells the BBC. The presidential election comes amid growing concerns about inflation, security challenges, poor social services, corruption and unemployment. Youth unemployment has been a particular talking point for most of the candidates running in the election. Nearly 40% of young Cameroonians between the ages of 15 and 35 are unemployed, with 23% of young graduates facing challenges in obtaining formal employment, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). ""Young people are more inclined to emigrate abroad because they tell themselves that inside the country, they do not have the possibility of becoming somebody,"" 26-old-year graduate Vanina Nzekui tells the BBC. ""They tell themselves that all positions are occupied by older people,"" she says, adding that this comes at the cost of using their skills to help develop the country. But Aziseh Mbi, 23, believes age should not be a criterion for leadership. In Biya's case, the civil society activist says, the president has been able to do ""significant things,"" citing several youth initiatives. Reuters President Biya was keen to appeal to women and young people during his only election rally Beyond youth unemployment, the electoral process has also stirred controversy, especially with the exclusion of Maurice Kamto from the presidential race. In July the electoral body barred the 71-year-old opposition leader from running because a rival faction of the party that had endorsed him presented someone else as a candidate. His exclusion, confirmed by the Constitutional Council, was widely criticised as a ploy to prevent any strong challenge to President Biya. After coming second in the 2018 presidential election, Kamto claimed victory and organised street protests. ""The exclusion of Prof Kamto waters down the legitimacy of our democracy because we should have been fair enough to allow for everybody to partake,"" says Dr Atia. Mr Wanah agrees that the absence of the country's main opposition figure ""reinforces the perception that truly fair elections cannot take place in Cameroon"". Twelve candidates were approved to contest for the country's top job, including Issa Tchiroma Bakary and Bello Bouba Maigari - both former Biya allies from the north of the country. They resigned from their ministerial positions in government to take on their boss. Lawmaker Cabral Libii, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) party Joshua Osih and Patricia Tomaïno Ndam Njoya - the lone female candidate - are also in the race. At the launch of the election campaign, two aspirants, including renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna, withdrew their candidacies to support Maigari of the NUDP party. This means 10 people will now compete for the presidency. Michel Mvondo / BBC Two candidates have withdrawn from the race and thrown their weight behind Bello Bouba Maigari, once a Biya ally Prior to the poll - which will only be a single-round vote as the person with the most votes will win - there had been widespread calls for the opposition to present a single candidate to challenge Biya, who has never lost an election. Tchiroma Bakary has secured the support of the Union for Change, a coalition of more than 50 political groups and civil society organisations who presented him as the opposition's consensus candidate. But the initiative has failed to gain unanimity, with others refusing to rally behind him. Kamto said he had held talks with some aspirants, including the two northern figures Tchiroma Bakary and Maigari, encouraging them to unite. As neither seemed ready to step down, he urged Cameroonians to vote for whomever they preferred. Dr Atia reckons the failure to endorse one candidate under a single coalition will cost the opposition at the ballot box. On the campaign trail, 76-year-old Tchiroma Bakary, a former government spokesperson, has been pulling big crowds - with some analysts positioning  the Cameroon National Salvation Front party leader as Biya's main challenger. On Sunday, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to see him in the economic capital Douala. He has promised to reform the system of which he was a part for two decades. Despite Tchiroma Bakary's support base in the north, analysts say Biya is likely to overpower him and the other opposition candidates. ""President Biya just needs a slim majority to win the election, and I see him winning despite the efforts being made by the opposition,"" says Dr Atia. Michel Mvondo / BBC Former government spokesperson Issa Tchiroma Bakary has promised reform and is drawing big crowds In Cameroon's English-speaking North-West and South-West regions, where a long-running separatist conflict continues, an election boycott lockdown has been imposed, paralysing business activities, movement and education. The separatists who have imposed it have threatened to target anyone who does vote. ""We have seen people [who] have been pulled out of their homes and slaughtered in cold blood, before, during, and even well after [previous] elections when they are identified,"" Samah Abang-Mugwa, a resident of one of the Anglophone regions, tells the BBC - adding that he will not risk casting his ballot. Since 2017, those seeking to create a breakaway state have been fighting government forces. They are angered by what they see as the marginalisation of Cameroon's minority Anglophone community by the Francophone-dominated government. The conflict has so far killed at least 6,000 people and forced nearly half a million others from their homes, according to the UN. According to civil society activist Abine Ayah, the likely exclusion of much of the English-speaking community could undermine the legitimacy of the election. Although Biya says his government has made significant efforts to resolve the conflict, his opponents in the presidential race continue to criticise his handling of the situation. After Sunday's vote, the Constitutional Council has 15 days to announce the results. The interior minister has already warned that no candidate is allowed to declare victory beforehand. Paul Atanga Nji made the comments on the eve of the last day of campaigning. ""Those who will attempt to announce results of the presidential election or any self-proclaimed victory in violation of the laws of the republic would have crossed the red line and should be ready to face the retaliatory measures commensurate to their crime.""

6ed6e6077d9f,Green turtle bounces back from brink in conservation 'win',,"Green turtle bounces back from brink in conservation 'win' Helen Briggs BBC environment correspondent Getty Green turtles are large sea turtles found in tropical and subtropical oceans, known for their plant-based diet and reliance on beaches for nesting The green turtle has been rescued from the brink of extinction in what scientists are calling a major conservation victory. Once hunted extensively for turtle soup, its eggs as a delicacy and decorative shells, the ancient mariner saw its numbers plummet and has been listed as endangered since the 1980s. Now, thanks to decades of global conservation efforts - from protecting eggs and releasing hatchlings on beaches, to reducing accidental capture in fishing nets - new data shows green turtle populations are rebounding. ""We must use this win as a catalyst to achieve numerous other wins,"" said Dr Nicolas Pilcher of the Marine Research Foundation, a non-profit based in Sabah, Malaysia. Getty Green turtle hatchling heading for the ocean after emerging from a nest buried in sand Green turtles are one of the largest species of sea turtles, named for the greenish colour of their body fat, which comes from their plant-based diet. They are one of seven living species of sea turtles, two of which are critically endangered. Prof Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter, said green turtle populations in many parts of the world are showing signs of recovery due to conservation efforts over the last five decades, and while this work must continue for years to come, it gives cause for optimism. ""Sea turtles are iconic and charismatic species... they inspire people,"" he said. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have been working for decades to try and look after these creatures, and undoubtedly, it has had an impact."" The conservation efforts include patrolling beaches, protecting females and their eggs at nesting sites, releasing hatchlings into the sea, education and awareness to reduce turtles being killed for meat and eggs, and using measures to stop turtles being captured in fishing nets. Getty A green sea turtle tangled in a fishing net off Pangasinan in the Philippines was rescued by local fishermen, tagged by environment officials, and safely released back into the sea The latest Red List of endangered species was revealed at the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) world congress in Abu Dhabi. The unenviable list now includes 172,620 species, of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction. Species are moved between categories when new data shows changes in their population, habitat or threats. If a species becomes more at risk - for example, its numbers fall or its habitat is damaged - it may be moved to a higher-risk category such as Endangered; if it recovers thanks to conservation efforts, it may shift to a lower-risk category like Near Threatened or Least Concern. The green turtle has been downgraded from Endangered to Least Concern. However, despite recent gains, green turtles are still far below their historic numbers due to past overexploitation and ongoing threats like fishing, habitat loss and climate change. In places like Raine Island, Australia, fewer baby turtles are hatching, showing that conservation efforts are still urgently needed. Kit Kovacs Bearded seal pup on ice The update to the endangered list brought bad news for other species, including Arctic seals, which are moving closer to extinction as sea ice is lost to climate change. The hooded seal has moved from Vulnerable to Endangered, while the bearded and harp seals are now Near Threatened due to shrinking sea ice. Arctic seals depend on sea ice for breeding, resting and feeding -  and the loss of the ice puts their survival at risk.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg426qqqqnro,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0524/live/c8f01350-a532-11f0-8469-192d9823e9a2.jpg,2025-10-10T08:01:28.681000+00:00,411d5b69bb00ac162d7da1ea0ea7227821546d80
20c9479325ca,Fossil found on Dorset coast is unique 'sword dragon' species,,"Fossil found on Dorset coast is unique 'sword dragon' species Jonah Fisher Environment correspondent Dean Lomax Ichthyosaur experts Dr Dean Lomax and Professor Judy Massare with the 185m year old skeleton A near-complete skeleton found on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a type of prehistoric marine reptile that once ruled the oceans. The dolphin-sized ichthyosaur has been named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the ""sword dragon of Dorset"" and is the only known example of its kind. Scientists say that marks on its skull suggest that the ""sword dragon"" may have been killed by a bite to the head, possibly inflicted by a much larger species of ichthyosaur. First discovered by a prolific fossil hunter at Golden Cap in Dorset in 2001 the new ichthyosaur was then acquired by a museum in Canada. Dean Lomax The skull of the ""sword dragon"" has a huge eye socket and a mark on its head that suggests it may have been attacked by another larger ichthyosaur It has only recently been fully analysed by experts and a paper published identifying it as a new species of ichthyosaur. ""I thought long and hard about the name,"" said ichthyosaur expert Dr Dean Lomax, who co-authored authored the paper identifying the skeleton as a new species. ""Xiphodracon translates to sword-like dragon and that is in reference to that very long, sword-like snout, but also the fact that ichthyosaurs have been referred to as sea dragons for about 200 years."" Getty Images This is a what ichthyosaurs may have looked like. This particular species is a shonisaurus which could grow to more than 15 metres long. Ichthyosaurs are classified as marine reptiles, not dinosaurs, and spent their lives in the water. This particular ichthyosaur is thought to have swum the seas about 185 million years ago, a period from which very few ichthyosaur fossils have been found. ""During this time ichthyosaurs are incredibly rare, and Xiphodracon is the most complete individual ever found from there, helping to fill a gap,"" Dr Lomax said. ""It's a missing piece of the puzzle in the ichthyosaur evolution."" The ""sword dragon"" is thought to have been about 3m long and has several features that have not been seen in other species of ichthyosaur.  Scientists say the strangest  detail is a prong-like bone near its nostril. The skull has an enormous eye socket and a long sword-like snout that it used to eat fish and squid. There are also clues as to how this particular specimen lived and died. ""The limb bones and teeth are malformed in such a way that points to serious injury or disease while the animal was still alive, "" said study co-author Dr Erin Maxwell from the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. ""The skull appears to have been bitten by a large predator - likely another much larger species of ichthyosaur - giving us a cause of death for this individual. Life in the Mesozoic oceans was a dangerous prospect."" The 'sword dragon' is one of numerous ichthyosaur fossils that have been found along Dorset's Jurassic Coast since the first discoveries of pioneering palaeontologist Mary Anning in the early 1800s. Chris Moore Chris Moore discovered the 'sword dragon' in cliffs at Golden Cap in Dorset after a storm This ""sword dragon"" was discovered in 2001 by fossil hunter Chris Moore and then acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada where it took more than 15 years to be fully analysed. ""I don't wish to blow my own ichthyosaur trumpet but I have found a few of them,"" Mr Moore said on a video call from Dorset. The actual number he's unearthed is somewhere in the region of 15, with several of them, like the ""sword dragon"", turning out to be new species. Mr Moore says he is planning to celebrate the new discovery but has yet to decide exactly how. ""Champagne or a mug of tea, I'm not sure which yet,"" he says.

d85b5b11f646,'How growing a sunflower helped me fight anorexia',,"'How growing a sunflower helped me fight anorexia' Malcolm Prior and Jenny Kumah BBC News rural affairs team Andy Alcroft/BBC Emily Hough is now using her experiences to help shape nature prescribing schemes For Emily Hough, nature was too often simply something ""out there"", a world apart from her, a view from a hospital window. Years spent in and out of specialist mental health units in Birmingham and London, being treated for the eating disorder she had had since the age of 12, meant she felt little connection with the countryside or interest in the everyday flora and fauna around her. That was until five years ago, when a hospital occupational therapist gave her an unusual prescription: Grow a sunflower. ""I'll be honest I'd never planted anything in my life,"" Ms Hough said. ""But I planted that sunflower and, just watching it grow, from me watering it and from me protecting it from the shade, helped me feel connected for the first time and really be able to appreciate what was around me - and how I can make a difference to nature and what nature can actually do for me. ""I was in a hospital at that point, so it was very limited. Fast forward five years, here we are today."" Getty Images Green social prescribing encourages people to take part in nature-based activities to benefit their health and wellbeing From those early roots, Ms Hough, now 35, embraced what is formally called by the NHS ""green social prescribing"" , where GPs and health practitioners refer patients to organisations that offer nature-based activities, whether that be hiking, birdwatching, rockpooling or looking after a city-based allotment. It is supposed to complement other more mainstream treatments and therapies and has been a key part of the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England. The scheme may not work for everyone but for Ms Hough, who has now relocated from Solihull to a life in the countryside, the benefits have been profound. She is now out of hospital and has become what the NHS calls an ""Expert by Experience"" (EbE) - someone who uses that experience to design and evaluate new health services. She helped shape the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)'s flagship ""nature prescription"" scheme for the West Midlands, launched earlier this year. On Friday – World Mental Health Day - the scheme marks the training of its 100th health professional, with enough resources to support 1,000 patients accessing nature-based activities. Andy Alcroft/BBC Dom Higgins, from the Wildlife Trusts, saids the evidence in favour of green social prescribing was clear But the future of green social prescribing is uncertain. Despite a four-year national pilot that ended in March being judged a success by an independent evaluation of its first two years, there is concern that the onus for funding these schemes is being left to charities. Organisations, including The Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB and the Ocean Conservation Trust, are calling on the government to commit more funding to nature prescription schemes and to roll them out, beyond their initial seven trial areas. Dom Higgins, head of health and education for The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""It is unequivocal that nature improves mental health. ""I think the time for questioning the evidence is really over and people within the system and the NHS and decision makers get this. ""It's just we need the mechanism to make it available everywhere. It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work."" The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas. Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought ""a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing"" for patients. The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested. When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published ""in due course"". 'Dramatic results' Although green social prescribing is designed to complement, not replace, conventional medical treatments and therapies, there are some who fear it does not deal with the bigger social health issues around mental health. Rob Poole, professor of social psychiatry at the Centre for Mental Health and Society, said that, while he was not against green social prescribing, it was an ""inadequate response to the social determinants of health, such as poor housing, poverty and deterioration in social infrastructure"". ""These are not lifestyle choices. They cannot be addressed by time-limited interventions, no matter how much better green activity makes you feel in the short run,"" he said. But Shannon Kang, an NHS health and wellbeing coach at the University Medical Practice in Birmingham, who has recently been trained in nature prescribing by the RSPB, said she had seen ""dramatic results"" - with patients' anxiety and stress levels reduced. For Ms Hough, getting in touch with the natural world has been life-changing: ""I was sceptical. For years I had walked around not appreciating nature. But I genuinely believe that nature has really helped save me. It has given me hope.""

33c3e5a48130,Naked mole rats' DNA could hold key to long life,,"Naked mole rats' DNA could hold key to long life Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Washington Post via Getty Images Naked mole rats live for up to 40 years, compared to about three years for a mouse They are weird, bald, subterranean rodents that look like sausages with teeth, and they have just revealed a genetic secret to long life. A new study of the bizarre naked mole rat shows that the animals have evolved a DNA repair mechanism that could explain their longevity. These burrow-dwelling rats have a maximum life span of nearly 40 years, making them the world's longest-lived rodent. The new findings, published in the journal Science , could also shed light on why naked mole rats are resistant to a wide range of age-related diseases. The animals are resistant to cancer, deterioration of the brain and spinal cord, and arthritis, so many scientists want to understand more about how their bodies work. For this study, led by a team at Tonji University in Shanghai, China, the focus was DNA repair - a natural process in our bodies' cells. When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break. The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair. When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together. Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan. In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact. Chicago Tribune via Getty Images Naked mole rats live in a network of underground tunnels and chambers Professor Gabriel Balmus studies DNA repair and ageing at the University of Cambridge. He said the discovery was exciting and ""the tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to understanding why these animals live such extraordinarily long lives. ""You can think of cGAS as a biological Lego piece - the same basic shape in humans and naked mole-rats, but in the mole-rat version a few connectors are flipped, allowing it to assemble an entirely different structure and function."" Over millions of years of evolution, Prof Balmus explained, naked mole-rats appear to have rewired the same pathway and ""used it to their advantage"". ""This finding raises fundamental questions: how did evolution reprogram the same protein to act in reverse? What changed? And is this an isolated case or part of a broader evolutionary pattern?"" Most importantly, scientists want to know what they can learn from these rodents to improve human health and extend quality of life with age. ""I think if we could reverse-engineer the naked mole-rat's biology,"" said Prof Balmus, ""we might bring some much-needed therapies for an ageing society.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7rxy21lxwo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d1e4/live/bb740ed0-a4fa-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T18:06:04.334000+00:00,e28443421349de1ad84238c909f1962ac44ae67b

The King's Foundation says the feature-length TV film, provisionally titled Finding Harmony: A King's Vision, will be screened on Amazon's Prime Video early next year. ""Never has it been more important for the world to make a concerted effort to protect and prioritise our planet, and to restore our relationship with it,"" the monarch said about the project. In the film the King will reflect on his own decades of campaigning for sustainability. The King said it was his ""fondest hope that this film may encourage a new audience to learn about the philosophy of harmony - and perhaps inspire the same sense of determination it has given me to help build a more sustainable future"". The King has appeared in a behind-the-scenes BBC film about the Coronation, but this will be a more unusual approach in looking at his beliefs. ""For much of my life I have sought to promote and encourage ways we can work with, rather than against nature. In other words, to restore balance to our planet which is under such stress,"" said the King. The one-off documentary will show how he believes humans are ""part of nature, not apart from nature"" and that a healthy connection with nature is at ""the core of human wellbeing"". With examples from around the world, the documentary will show how the philosophy of harmony can be applied to agriculture, traditional craft skills, architecture and town planning. ""This film will, I hope, demonstrate just some of the remarkable work being done around the world to put harmony into practice, from the forests of Guyana to sustainable communities in India – and, closer to home, through the work of my King's Foundation at Dumfries House and Highgrove,"" said the King. King's Foundation The King heard from Indigenous peoples about the importance of living with nature Director Nicolas Brown said there was a gap in knowledge about how the King's views on harmony had shaped his work. ""Remarkably few people around the world know the full depth of the King's lifelong battle to bring nature and humanity into harmony,"" he said. Their cameras recorded the King's first harmony summit, held at Highgrove in Gloucestershire in July. This brought together leaders of Indigenous people from around the world who shared their knowledge of how communities could live in tune with the natural world. Along with the King, they performed a fire ceremony at the start of the day, paying their respects to nature. The King's views on harmony and the design of towns have also influenced thinking about creating a new generation of new towns in England . With his Amazon documentary, the King will be the latest royal to appear on a streaming service. Prince William recently faced questions from Eugene Levy on Apple TV+ and Prince Harry and Meghan were in a Netflix series about their departure from royal life. They have provided platforms for the royals to share their thoughts and opinions, but without a conventional interview format.

The three scientists' work could tackle some of the biggest problems on our planet, including capturing carbon dioxide to help tackle climate change and reducing plastic pollution using chemistry. ""I'm deeply honoured and delighted, thank you very much,"" said Professor Kitagawa on the phone to a press conference after he was told the news. ""How long do I have to stay here? Because I have to go out for a meeting,"" he added. Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it ""molecular architecture"". The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. These ""rooms"" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds. So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced. One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories. Professor Robson, who was born in North Yorkshire but has been based at the University of Melbourne since 1966, told BBC Newshour that the news ""wasn't a big surprise [because of] all sorts of sounds I've been hearing over the years"". When asked about the potential applications of his work he urged caution:  ""There's talk about binding CO2 and solving the world's atmospheric problems, which don't sound realistic to me - but these sorts of compounds could do that sort of job on a small scale"". The 88-year-old professor admits the prize money ""is the main thing actually in my head. It wasn't the driving force for all of this but at this stage in my life that's a very nice thought to have"". The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems. ""Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,"" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of ""the usefulness of useless"", according to the Nobel committee. It reflected the philosophy of an ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who said that even if something did not bring immediate benefit, it could still turn out to be valuable. Professor Yaghi was born in Amman, Jordan and raised in a single room with his siblings without electricity or running water, according to the Nobel committee. He became captivated by molecular structures one day at school, and aged 15, he went to the US to study. It is the third science prize awarded this week. On Tuesday John Clarke, Michel H.

""There is no advanced technology used today that does not rely on quantum mechanics, including mobile phones, cameras... and fibre optic cables,"" said the Nobel committee. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden. ""To put it mildly, it was a surprise of my life,"" said Professor John Clarke, who was born in Cambridge, UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley. Michel H. Devoret was born in Paris, France and is a professor at Yale University while John M. Martinis is a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000). The Nobel committee recognised breakthrough work performed by the three men in a series of experiments in the 1980s on electrical circuits. In the words of the committee, ""the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit"". Even for a field often considered dense, this discovery sounds bewildering. Getty Images But its implications have been profound and far-reaching. The electronic devices that most of us use rely on it, and the findings are being used to build extremely powerful computers. ""This is something that leads to development of the quantum computer. Many people are working on quantum computing, our discovery is in many ways the basis of this,"" said Prof Clarke on the phone to the news conference moments after he was told he had won. He appeared mystified that his work completed forty years ago is worthy of science's most prestigious prize. ""I'm completely stunned. At the time we did not realise in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,"" he said. Quantum mechanics relates to the behaviour of tiny things in a tiny world. It refers to what particles like the electron do in the sub-atomic world. Professor Clarke and his team looked at how these particles appeared to break rules like travelling through energy barriers that conventional physics said was impossible - something called ""tunnelling"". Using quantum ""tunnelling"", the electron manages to burrow through the energy barrier. Their work demonstrated that tunnelling can be reproduced not only in the quantum world, but also in electrical circuits in the 'real world'. This knowledge has been harnessed by scientists in making modern quantum chips. ""This is wonderful news indeed, and very well deserved,"" said Professor Lesley Cohen, Associate Provost in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London.

""When I first stepped onto the ice... there [was] a special feeling of eternity,"" says Matthias. Today, the ice is half an hour from the same parking spot and the scene is very different. ""Every time I go back, I remember how it used to be,"" recalls Matthias, now director of Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS), ""how the glacier looked when I was a child."" There are similar stories for many glaciers all over the planet, because these frozen rivers of ice are retreating - fast. In 2024, glaciers outside the giant ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization report. That's equivalent to a block of ice 7km (4.3 miles) tall, 7km wide and 10km deep - enough water to fill 180 million Olympic swimming pools. ""Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world,"" says Prof Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography at the University of Bremen. ""They are sitting in a climate that is very hostile to them now because of global warming."" Switzerland's glaciers have been particularly badly hit, losing a quarter of their ice in the last 10 years, measurements from GLAMOS revealed this week. ""It's really difficult to grasp the extent of this melt,"" explains Dr Huss. But photos - from space and the ground - tell their own story. Satellite images show how the Rhône Glacier has changed since 1990, when Dr Huss first visited. At the front of the glacier is a lake where there used to be ice. Until recently, glaciologists in the Alps used to consider 2% of ice lost in a single year to be ""extreme"". Then 2022 blew that idea out of the water, with nearly 6% of Switzerland's remaining ice lost in a single year. That has been followed by significant losses in 2023, 2024 and now 2025 too. Regine Hock, professor of glaciology at the University of Oslo, has been visiting the Alps since the 1970s. The changes over her lifetime are ""really stunning"", she says, but ""what we see now is really massive changes within a few years"". The Clariden Glacier, in north-eastern Switzerland, was roughly in balance until the late 20th Century - gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to melting. But this century, it's melted rapidly. For many smaller glaciers, like the Pizol Glacier in the north-east Swiss Alps, it's been too much. ""This is one of the glaciers that I observed, and now it's completely gone,"" says Dr Huss. ""It definitely makes me sad."" Photographs allow us to look even further back in time. The Gries Glacier, in southern Switzerland near the Italian border, has retreated by about 2.2km (1.4 miles) in the past century. Where the end of the glacier once stood is now a large glacial lake. In south-east Switzerland, the Pers Glacier once fed the larger Morteratsch Glacier, which flows down towards the valley. Now the two no longer meet. And the largest glacier in the Alps, the Great Aletsch, has receded by about 2.3km (1.4 miles) over the past 75 years. Where there was ice, there are now trees. Glaciers have grown and shrunk naturally for millions of years, of course. In the cold snaps of the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries - part of the Little Ice Age - glaciers regularly advanced. During this time, many were considered cursed by the devil in Alpine folklore, their advances linked to spiritual forces as they threatened hamlets and farmland. There are even tales of villagers calling on priests to talk to the spirits of glaciers and get them to move up the mountain. Glaciers began their widespread retreat across the Alps in about 1850, though the timing varied from place to place. That coincided with rising industrialisation, when burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, began to heat up our atmosphere, but it's hard to disentangle natural and human causes that far back in time. Where there is no real doubt is that the particularly rapid losses of the past 40 years or so are not natural. Without humans warming the planet - by burning fossil fuels and releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) – glaciers would be expected to be roughly stable. ""We can only explain it if we take into account CO2 emissions,"" confirms Prof Marzeion. What is even more sobering is that these large, flowing bodies of ice can take decades to fully adjust to the rapidly warming climate. That means that, even if global temperatures stabilised tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat. ""A large part of the future melt of the glaciers is already locked in,"" explains Prof Marzeion. ""They are lagging climate change."" But all is not lost. Half of the ice remaining across the world's mountain glaciers could be preserved if global warming is limited to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels of the late 1800s, according to research published this year in the journal Science . Our current trajectory is leading us towards warming of about 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which would see three-quarters of ice lost eventually. That extra water going into rivers and eventually the oceans means higher sea levels for coastal populations around the world. But the loss of ice will be particularly acutely felt by mountain communities dependent on glaciers for fresh water. Glaciers are a bit like giant reservoirs. They collect water as snowfall - which turns into ice - during cold, wet periods, and release it as meltwater during warm periods. This meltwater helps to stabilise river flows during hot, dry summers - until the glacier disappears. The loss of that water resource has knock-on effects for all those who rely on glaciers - for irrigation, drinking, hydropower and even shipping traffic. Switzerland is not immune from those challenges, but the implications are much more profound for the high mountains of Asia, referred to by some as the Third Pole due to the volume of ice. About 800 million people rely at least partly on meltwater from glaciers there, particularly for agriculture. That includes the upper Indus river basin, which serves parts of China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In regions with drier summers, meltwater from ice and snow can be the only significant source of water for months. ""That's where we see the biggest vulnerability,"" says Prof Hock. So how do scientists feel when confronted by the future prospects of glaciers in a warming world? ""It's sad,"" says Prof Hock. ""But at the same time, it's also empowering. If you decarbonise and reduce the [carbon] footprint, you can preserve glaciers. ""We have it in our hands."" Top image: Tschierva Glacier, Swiss Alps, in 1935 and 2022.

Prince William will travel to Rio de Janeiro next month for the ceremony - the first time the awards have been hosted in Latin America. The prize, created by the prince five years ago, awards £1m every year to five projects for their environmental innovations. There have been almost 2,500 nominees this year from 72 countries - this year's winners will be chosen by Prince William and his Earthshot Prize Council which includes the actor, Cate Blanchett and Jordan's Queen Rania. This year's list of finalists range from a Caribbean country to small start-up businesses. The Earthshot Prize is a 10-year project with past ceremonies held in London, Boston, Singapore and Cape Town. Kensington Palace confirmed earlier this year that the main awards ceremony will be held at Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Tomorrow on 5 November. Barbados has been nominated for its global leadership on climate with the island on track to become fossil-free by 2030. The Chinese city of Guangzhou is shortlisted in the ""Clean our Air"" category for electrification of its public transport system. Prince William previously said he would like to take the Earthshot Prize to China. Finally, what has been billed as the world's first fully ""upcycled skyscraper"" makes the final list too. Sydney's Quay Quarter Tower was one of thousands of 20th century towers now reaching the end of their lifespans. Instead of demolition, which releases vast amounts of carbon and waste, a coalition of architects, engineers, building contractors and developers has effectively ""upcycled"" the original structure. ""Matter"" is the only British finalist in the line-up. Based in Bristol, the business has developed a filter for washing machines removing the greatest cause of microplastics in our oceans. ""I feel like winning an Earthshot prize for me would be like winning an Olympic gold medal,"" said Adam Root, the founder of Matter. Reuters In 2024, Actor Billy Porter and Earthshot ambassadors Robert Irwin and Nomzamo Mbatha joined the Prince of Wales on stage at the awards In a video message released to mark the announcement of this year's finalists, he reflected on the past five years. ""Back then, a decade felt a long time. George was seven, Charlotte, five, and Louis two; the thought of them in 2030 felt a lifetime away,"" said Prince William. ""But today, as we stand halfway through this critical decade, 2030 feels very real. ""2030 is a threshold by which future generations will judge us; it is the point at which our actions, or lack of them, will have shaped forever the trajectory of our planet."" He added: ""The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now."" The Earthshot Prize is now one of the key pieces of Prince William's public work. ""He has been able to build an unprecedented network of organisations,"" Jason Knauf, the new CEO of the Earthshot Prize, said. ""The philanthropists working together, the corporates that come together as part of the Earthshot prize community, the leaders who get involved. ""There's never been a group of people working together on a single environment project in the way they have with the Earthshot Prize. Prince William has been completely relentless in building that network.""

90984706df14,Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins,,"Dame Jane Goodall revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins Victoria Gill Science correspondent Watch: Jane Goodall tells BBC how she became interested in animals She was a serene force of nature. And she never wavered in her mission to help the animals to which she dedicated her life. When I interviewed Dame Jane Goodall last year, she exuded calm, even as she pressed home to me that a great extinction crisis was facing our planet. Over a slightly blurry video call, I could see her toy monkey, Mr H, behind her. That toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend. Dr Goodall, who was 90 years old when we spoke, was still travelling the world with Mr H at her side. Researchers I've spoken to this evening, whose work Dr Goodall inspired, or who were simply inspired by her energy, are in shock at her death aged 91. Professor Cat Hobaiter, from the University of St Andrews, who has worked with Chimpanzees - studying their communication - for more than 15 years, told me that one reason Dr Goodall had such an impact was that ""she gave up doing what she loved - spending time with her beloved chimpanzees - to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion with everyone she met."" In the many years that Jane Goodall observed and studied chimpanzees, she revolutionised our understanding of our closest primate cousins. Key to her groundbreaking discoveries were her curiosity and ability - quietly - to observe. Getty Images Dr Goodall ""gave up doing what she loved... to tirelessly travel the world and share her passion"" It was during her time in the rainforest reserve at Gombe, in Tanzania, when she stopped to spend time watching a male chimpanzee who was foraging. The chimp took a twig, bent and stripped it of its leaves, then he poked it into a termite's nest. He then used that stripped, bent twig to spoon the termites into his mouth. That observation - in 1960 - challenged the belief that only humans made and used tools. Even as she changed our understanding of the natural world, Dr Goodall faced cynicism and sexism. She was not formally trained as a scientist. And, in the 1960s, that was unusual. Her work in Gombe went on to show that chimps also form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory. But her approach – associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as ""my friends"" - made her unpopular with the male-dominated scientific establishment. Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, saw the value in that informality. ""He wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,"" she said. Getty Images Dr Goodall was still travelling the world into her 90s with her toy monkey, Mr H, at her side Now, the scientific establishment is reeling from the loss of a great scientist. Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Society, described her as ""an amazing scientist who inspired people to see the natural world in a new way"". Roger Highfield, from the Science Museum in London, which awarded Dr Goodall a fellowship earlier this year, called her an ""inspiration"". ""She was formidable and it's incredibly shocking news, because she completely changed how we think about other species and how we think about ourselves - she challenged human exceptionalism,"" he said. Jane Goodall eventually turned her focus from her chimpanzees to spreading the word about protecting nature. When she spoke to me for BBC Inside Science in 2024 , she was promoting a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation was carrying out in Uganda. ""We still have a window of time to slow down climate change and loss of biodiversity,"" she said at the time. ""But it's a window that's closing."" Prof Hobaiter, one of the many scientists Dr Goodall inspired, told me: ""Jane would be the first person to tell us that what the world needs right now is not sadness over her loss, but to get to work. ""We all have a lot to be getting on with to make sure that we are not the last generation to live alongside wild chimpanzees.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj1pz8q63go,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d9f8/live/de46afc0-9f06-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-01T20:53:35.157000+00:00,78c32b140229cb1f927fe5965e0260734bff63e1

Sir David, 99, a friend of Dr Goodall's, praised her as a ""tireless advocate"" of chimpanzees and ""a great champion of environmental protection"". The Prince of Wales said she inspired him personally and ""her boundless curiosity, compassion and pioneering spirit transformed our understanding of the natural world"". Dr Goodall died of natural causes while in California on a speaking tour of the US, according to a statement from the Jane Goodall Institute. It said her discoveries ""revolutionised science"" and that she advocated ""for the protection and restoration of our natural world"". In a statement issued to the PA news agency, BBC presenter and renowned environmentalist Sir David said: ""Jane Goodall was the first to prove that an investigating scientist and a great ape living in the wild could become true friends and in doing so she came to transform our understanding of chimpanzees."" Prince William said ""the world has lost an extraordinary voice"" in a post on X, adding: ""she challenged us all to make a difference and inspired me and countless others to work to protect our planet. Jane Goodall made a difference."" Many other public figures as well as global organisations have praised Dr Goodall's legacy. Former US president Barack Obama said Dr Goodall ""opened doors for generations of women in science"", while actor and environmental campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio said she ""inspired millions to care, to act, and to hope"", and called her ""a true hero for the planet"". The United Nations said it mourned the loss of Dr Goodall, saying that she ""worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature"". Greenpeace said it was ""heartbroken"" by her death, calling her ""one of the true conservation giants of our time"". Its co-executive director in the UK, Will McCallum, said: ""Dr Goodall's legacy is not only in science but in the global movement she helped spark to protect nature and give hope for a better world."" Naturalist Chris Packham told the BBC that he counted her among his heroes, calling her ""revolutionary"" and ""remarkable"". ""To have lost a hero at a time when we need all of them on the frontline fighting for life on earth is a tragedy."" Getty Images Dr Jane Goodall observing a chimpanzee in Tanzania in 1987 Born in 1934 and raised in London, Dr Goodall said she became fascinated by animals after reading books like The Story of Dr Doolittle and Tarzan. She met leading primatologist Prof Louis Leakey while staying on a friend's farm in Kenya in her mid-twenties.  Although she had no qualifications, Mr Leakey saw her potential and helped arrange her first research trip to the jungles of Tanzania in 1960. That year, she became the first person to record witnessing an animal using a tool - a large male chimpanzee, who she had named David Greybeard, digging termites out of a mound with a stick. Until then, it was thought only humans were intelligent enough to do so. Her observations challenged years of conventional scientific thinking and shaped the future of evolutionary science. Her work was published in leading journals, and in 1965 she made the front cover of National Geographic, introducing the world to the emotional and social lives of the primates. Getty Images She featured in 'Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees', narrated by Orson Welles and first broadcast in 1965 She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds and even engage in warfare over territory. She featured in a television documentary narrated by Orson Welles, which saw her playing and wrestling with baby chimps. Her approach - associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as ""my friends"" - was scoffed at by some, mostly male, scientists at the time. She undertook a PhD based on her findings, despite not having an undergraduate degree or any prior scientific training. After her experiences in the field she became an activist, working to free chimpanzees kept in zoos or in captivity for medical research, and later urged action on climate change in the face of widespread habitat devastation. She told the BBC in 2024 : ""We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction... the more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better."" Asked what kept her motivated late in life, she said: ""Surely people want a future for their children."" Getty Images Alongside her work with chimpanzees, Dr Goodall also advocated for the protection of orangutans and other great apes Her Jane Goodall Institute, founded in 1977, works to protect chimpanzees and supports projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment. Dr Goodall was appointed a Dame in 2003 and received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025. She was known for travelling constantly for her work, telling the Times newspaper in 2022 that she had not slept in the same bed for more than three weeks since 1986. Dr Goodall worked right up until her death, being interviewed on stage in New York  a week ago. She was due to speak again at a sold-out event on 3 October in California. PA Media Tributes have poured in for Dame Jane from across the globe, praising her advocacy and ""compassion"" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined the many honouring the legacy of Dr Goodall, describing her as a ""tireless advocate"" for the protection of nature. ""Dr Jane Goodall DBE was a visionary humanitarian, scientist, friend to the planet, and friend to us,"" Prince Harry and Meghan said in a statement. Former Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said ""her compassion will live on"" in future conservation work. Secretary General of the United Nations António Guterres hailed her work as a Messenger of Peace, a UN title she has held since 2002 for bringing ""global attention to the urgency of protecting our environment"".

Reiterating the words of his predecessor Pope Francis, the new pontiff lambasted critics who ""ridicule those who speak of global warming"". The Pope's remarks, at a speech in Castel Gondolfo near Rome, will be seen as an implied criticism of US President Donald Trump, who last month called climate change a ""con"". Pope Leo also called for greater action from citizens the world over on climate change, saying there was no room for indifference or resignation. The Pope was speaking at a conference to mark 10 years since the publication of Laudato Si'. That landmark document , written by his predecessor Pope Francis, made the issue of climate a central part of the church's concerns. Many credit it for helping set the tone that led to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But the new Pope, who was elected in May, was worried that the question of climate change was now becoming more divisive. Referring to his predecessor's writings, he said: ""Some have chosen to deride the increasingly evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming, and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them the most."" Just two weeks ago at the UN General Assembly in New York, US President Donald Trump criticised the climate movement as the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"", and rebuffed the use of renewable energy. ""The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction,"" he said. Pope Leo, the first pontiff born in the US, has previously clashed with Trump's White House on issues including migration and national security. Getty Images Pope Leo told the meeting that citizens needed to put more pressure on politicians over climate change In Wednesday's speech, the Pope called for people all over the world to put increased pressure on politicians. Citizens need to take an active role in political decisions, he said, as ""only then will it be possible to mitigate the damage done to the environment"". The Pope said that each of us will have to answer a question from God. ""God will ask us if we have cultivated and cared for the world that he created for the benefit of all and for future generations, and if we have taken care of our brothers and sisters - what will be our answer, my dear friends?"" The Raising Hope conference was held just over a month from the start of COP30 in Belém, in Brazil. World leaders and climate diplomats will meet in the Amazonian city as efforts to tackle rising emissions of planet warming gases have fallen down the political agenda.

2bc502092248,"Dismissed as a joke, UK's first rice crop ripe for picking after hot summer",,"Dismissed as a joke, UK's first rice crop ripe for picking after hot summer Georgina Rannard Climate and science correspondent Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Nadine Mitschunas is the UK's first rice grower Gwyndaf Hughes Climate and science videographer In an ordinary field in a quiet part of east England, a unique experiment is taking root. ""When I tell people what I'm doing here, they think I'm joking,"" says Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's first and only rice-grower. The crops in four small paddy fields are doing well, helped by basking in our hottest summer on record. ""We could never have contemplated this would grow here,"" says farmer Sarah Taylor, whose land the rice is planted  on. ""Not in a million years,"" her husband Craig adds. This young crop is part of an ambitious trial to see what foods Britain could grow in the future. The trial is trying to answer big questions about how we can produce enough food and protect farmer's livelihoods in a world being altered by climate change. The BBC got a sneak peek at the rice plants before harvest. Rice plants look a lot like thick grass. But running up the stalks there are small beads - these are the rice grains. They were still brown when we visited, but will be picked when they turn white. Nadine, an award-winning ecologist, is incredibly proud. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC The UK's first rice paddy field - where nine varieties of the crop have been grown this year ""I'm actually amazed because they are big, happy, bushy plants,"" she says, warning me not to fall over when we step into the calf-deep water. She points out her favourites. ""This is Estrella from Colombia, the best one so far,"" she says. ""But I'm least impressed with this,"" she says, gesturing to a Japanese rice that has not flowered. This experiment is the brainchild of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), in partnership with Craig and Sarah Taylor. Dozens of plants were planted in four mini paddy fields dug out and flooded on the Taylors' farm a few miles north of Ely in Cambridgeshire. We often think of rice as a tropical plant, but it does grow in colder climates. Nine varieties are growing, including from Brazil, Colombia, Italy and the Philippines. They include the stars of the rice world - risotto, basmati and sushi. The plants did well in the hot, sunny summer, which the Met Office says was the hottest in the UK since records began in 1884. ""Nobody has tried this before, but with climate change, we have crops that, 10 years ago, we wouldn't have thought would be viable. In 10 years time, rice could be a completely perfect crop for us,"" Nadine says. This is the very edge of where rice can grow at the moment and it would be a risky crop for farmers to plant commercially, says Prof Richard Pywell who is leading the project for UKCEH. But Britain's climate is changing quickly. If annual average temperatures warm by between 2 and 4C compared to pre-industrial levels - a scenario that many scientists say is likely - rice could be grown widely in the UK, according to research. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC The rice is part of a bigger trial looking at the future of agriculture in the UK But this project is about more than growing British rice for our dinner plates. It could also help the UK tackle climate change. The land in the Fens is some of the most productive in the UK. A third of the vegetables grown in Britain come from here, with a value of around £1.2bn per year. But this has a significant cost for the environment and climate. The farms are on rich peat soil that used to be underwater but is now slowly drying out. That is releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Nationally, peat soils account for 3% of our greenhouse gas emissions. That is also degrading the quality of the soil, a change seen in real time by farmers like Craig and Sarah. They feel deeply connected to the land and its history. ""All my ancestors were Fenmen. I love this place, we've been here for 500 plus years,"" says Craig. The rice field is surrounded by potato, onion and beet crops, which are still the thriving staples here. Digging a healthy clump of potatoes from the rich, black soil, Craig says, ""potatoes are an amazing crop. You can't knock that, but we know things need to change."" ""We don't want people thinking we're the 'crazy rice farmers' - this is about rethinking the whole system and making it work for everyone,"" he says. Unpredictable weather patterns in recent years have hit farmers nationally, affecting harvests and crop yields in some cases. ""We see that the future isn't stable. We want to be able to write our own destiny and not have it decided for us,"" says Sarah. ""Our legacy for our children and hopefully their children is really important to us and I want them to know that we at least try to make a difference,"" she says. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Craig and Sarah Taylor's families have farmed in Cambridgeshire for generations As well as rice, the team are trialling other crops including lettuce and hybrid willow that grow in waterlogged conditions. By flooding the peat soils in parts of Cambridgeshire, greenhouse gases could stay locked in the wet soil, cutting off that source of greenhouse gas emissions. Even though growing rice produces methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, initial results from the trials so far suggest the rice crop is not producing more emissions than it helps lock away. The government is interested in what happens here too, and officials from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs have visited the site. It could be a radical breakthrough in one of the thorniest questions in the UK - how to protect farming and food supplies, while also addressing the huge impacts they have on the environment and climate. The UK food system, including imports, is equivalent to 38% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, while agriculture accounts for 11.7%. Growing rice on peat soils won't fix that overnight, but it could provide a model. ""We're at a critical juncture in climate change and we need to make decisions. We need to understand what sort of crops we could be potentially growing in the future,"" explains Richard from UKCEH. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Rice varieties including risotto and basmati are growing in the trial in Cambridgeshire ""It's possible that for certain areas, peatland re-wetting and growing rice may be a viable option. In other areas, we may continue to grow our conventional crops, but under different conditions,"" he says. Growing rice domestically sounds simple, but this is a complicated project with big ambitions. It will still be some time before we can test taste a UK rice crop - but it's a very real possibility that in the next decade, UK-grown rice could be coming to our dinner plates.

b8423fa96c7d,"Environment Agency failed to visit serious pollution incidents, files show",,"Environment Agency failed to visit serious pollution incidents, files show Jonah Fisher Environment correspondent Getty Images Serious pollution incidents are those which have an impact on the environment, people or property. Documents and data shared with BBC News from inside England's much criticised environment watchdog show an agency struggling to monitor incidents of serious pollution. The information shows the Environment Agency (EA) only sent investigators to a small fraction of reported incidents last year and often relied on water companies - who may be responsible for the pollution - for updates. An internal EA document from this year states that all potentially serious incidents should be attended by staff. But in 2024, the EA didn't go to almost a third of nearly 100 water industry incidents that were eventually ruled to have posed a serious threat to nature or human health. The agency also downgraded the environmental impact of more than 1,000 incidents that it initially decided were potentially serious without sending anyone to take a look. The EA says it does ""respond"" to all incidents but has ways to assess pollution that don't involve going in person. It says when reports come in it is ""careful not to underestimate the seriousness of an incident report"". But the EA insider who provided the BBC with the data was critical of the agency. ""What not attending means is that you are you are basically only dealing with water company evidence. And it's very rare that their own evidence is very damning,"" the insider said. Among the incident reports shared with the BBC were an occasion when a chemical spilled into a reservoir killing all its fish and which the EA did not attend.  Another time, sewage bubbled up into a garden for more than 24 hours with no deployment from the EA. The BBC is not printing specific details from the reports to protect the identity of the whistleblower. But they show an agency often slow to respond and frequently copying water company updates into EA documents verbatim before downgrading incidents. Other documents show pollution incidents that were reported to the EA by water companies hours after the problem had already been solved, making the impact much harder to assess as the evidence may have washed away. The data show that overall the agency went to just 13% of all the pollution incidents, serious and more limited, that were reported to it in 2024. Jonah Fisher/BBC Ashley Smith from the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) says its ""virtually impossible"" to get the Environment Agency to come out. ""It's virtually impossible to get them to come out,"" Ashley Smith a veteran water quality campaigner from the Oxfordshire based campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) told the BBC. ""(When you call the EA) they go through a scenario where they'll say 'are there any dead fish'. And, typically there are not dead fish because often the fish are able to escape. ""The EA then says – we'll report that to Thames Water – and it will be Thames Water if anyone who gets in touch with you."" Jonah Fisher/BBC Matt Staniek (front row) is leading a campaign to get Windermere in the Lake District cleaned up Matt Staniek is a water quality campaigner in the Lake District and cited several incidents where he says the EA took explanations from the local water company about sewage spills at face value, which later through his own data requests were proved wrong. ""The Environment Agency has not been holding United Utilities accountable,"" he says. ""And the only way that we get them to properly turn up to pollution incidents and now actually try and do a proper investigation is by going to the media with it, and that should not be the case."" A United Utilities spokesperson responded saying ""we are industry leading at self-reporting incidents to the Environment Agency"". As part of the government's landmark review of water industry regulation it has promised to end ""self reporting"" of incidents by water companies. There is widespread agreement that the current system is not working and plans are being drawn up to merge the regulators – including the EA - which oversee different parts of the water industry – into just one. ""The Environment Agency is so hollowed out that it cannot investigate pollution crimes, effectively telling polluters they can act with impunity,"" James Wallace, the chief executive of campaign group River Action, told the BBC. In July the BBC revealed that staff shortages had led to the EA cancelling thousands of water quality tests at its main laboratory in Devon. ""We respond to every water pollution incident report we receive,"" an Environment Agency spokesperson said. ""To make sure we protect people and the environment, we are careful not to underestimate the seriousness of an incident report when it comes in. Final incident categorisations may change when further information comes to light. This is all part of our standard working practice."" The EA says in the next year it's aiming to more than double the number of water company inspections it carries out. To do that the agency says it's in the process of recruiting five hundred more staff and improving the way it handles data.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4jk8njpngo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b78a/live/381897e0-9555-11f0-a9d0-b91ec0b66439.jpg,2025-09-25T01:07:14.491000+00:00,eaece8dc2590c700b0f70bdae6ce4b03710b466c
a03fb30bdf7f,"America's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts say",,"America's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts say Nadine Yousif Senior Canada reporter Getty Images Smoke from Canada's wildfires have drifted south to the US several times this summer, clouding the sky with an orange haze. As deadly wildfires raged in the Canadian province of Manitoba this summer, Republican lawmakers in nearby US states penned letters asking that Canada be held accountable for the smoke drifting south. ""Our skies are being choked by wildfire smoke we didn't start and can't control,"" wrote Calvin Callahan, a Republican state representative from Wisconsin, in a letter dated early August. Callahan, along with lawmakers from Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota, filed a formal complaint with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urging an investigation into Canada's wildfire management. Manitoba premier Wab Kinew quickly condemned the move, accusing the lawmakers of throwing a ""timber tantrum"" and playing ""political games"". By August, the wildfires had scorched more than two million acres in Manitoba, forced thousands to evacuate, and killed two people – a married couple who authorities said were trapped by fast-moving flames around their family home. As September draws to a close, data shows that 2025 is on track to be Canada's second-worst wildfire season on record. A study published in the Nature journal in September has revealed that smoke from Canada's wildfires has also had far-reaching, fatal consequences. It estimates that the 2023 wildfires - the country's worst on record by area burned - caused more than 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide, including 4,100 acute, smoke-related deaths in the US and over 22,000 premature deaths in Europe. Wildfire smoke contains PM2.5 - a type of air pollution - that is known to trigger inflammation in the body. It can exacerbate conditions like asthma and heart disease, and, in some causes, can damage neural connections in the brain. ""These are big numbers,"" said Michael Brauer, a professor at the University of British Columbia who co-authored the study. He added the findings show wildfire smoke should be treated as a serious health issue, akin to breast cancer or prostate cancer. For some American lawmakers, the blame falls squarely on Canada. ""Canada's failure to contain massive wildfires,"" Callahan wrote in August, ""has harmed the health and quality of life of more than 20 million Americans in the Midwest."" Their complaints raise the question: Could Canada be doing more to curb its wildfires – and by extension, their smoke? Climate and fire experts in both countries told the BBC that the answer is largely no. ""Until we as a global society deal with human-cased climate change, we're going to have this problem,"" said Mike Flannigan, an emergency management and fire science expert at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia. Gallo Images/Orbital Horizon/Copernicus Sentinel Data 2025 Wildfire smoke can often travel thousands of miles. A satellite image here from August shows smoke from a fire in Newfoundland drifting over the Atlantic Ocean. Metrics show Canada's wildfires, a natural part of its vast boreal forest, have worsened in recent years. Fire season now starts earlier, ends later, and burns more land on average. The 2023 fires razed 15 million hectares (37 million acres) – an area larger than England – while the 2025 blazes have so far burned 8.7 million hectares (21.5 million acres). As of mid-September, there are still more than 500 fires burning, mostly in British Columbia and Manitoba, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Roughly half of Canada's wildfires are sparked by lightning, while the rest stem from human activity, data from the National Forestry Database shows. Experts warn that hotter temperatures are making the land drier and more prone to ignition. Wildfires are not only worsening in Canada. The US has recently seen some of its most damaging blazes, including the 2023 Hawaii wildfires that killed at least 102 people, and the Palisades fire in January, the most destructive in Los Angeles history. Both countries have struggled to keep pace, often sharing firefighting resources. Canadian water bombers were deployed in California this year, while more than 600 US firefighters travelled north to assist Canada, according to the US Forest Service. In Canada, strained resources – and worsening fires – have fuelled calls for a national firefighting service. Wildfire emergency response is currently handled separately by each of the provinces and territories. ""The system we have right now worked 40 years ago. Today? Not so much,"" argued Mr Flannigan. Others propose controlled burns, a practice used in Australia and by indigenous communities, as a solution, though these fires would still generate smoke. Some argue for better clearing of flammable material in forests and near towns, or investing in new technology that can help detect wildfires faster. Some of that work is already underway. In August, Canada pledged more than $47m for research projects to help communities better prepare for and mitigate wildfires. Getty Images Major Canadian cities, like Vancouver, have also been dealing with wildfire smoke. Still, experts like Jen Beverly, a wildland fire professor at the University of Alberta, warn there is little Canada can do to prevent wildfires altogether. ""These are high intensity fire ecosystems"" in Canada, she said, that are different from fires in Australia or the US. ""We have very difficult fires to manage under extreme conditions, and we're seeing more of those because of climate change."" With a warmer climate, Prof Beverly said attention should be paid to pollution. She noted that the US is the second-worst carbon emitter in the world behind China. ""I mean, we should be blaming them for the problem,"" she argued. In recent months, the Trump administration has also rolled back environmental policies designed to reduce emissions, and has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accords. Sheila Olmstead, an enviromental policy professor at Cornell University, noted that Canada and the US have a history of cooperation on pollution and climate, including an air quality agreement signed by the two in 1991 to address acid rain. ""It was a very clear framework for addressing the problem, and that's what seems to be missing here,"" Olmstead told the BBC. Both countries, she said, would benefit from working together on wildfires instead of trading blame. As for the EPA complaint, it is unclear what the agency could do to address the US lawmakers' concerns. In a statement to the BBC, the EPA said it is reviewing it ""and will respond through appropriate channels"". Prof Brauer said the data in his study shows that even though the fires are burning in Canada - often in remote areas - their impact can reach far beyond. The findings, he told the BBC, call for a re-framing of how the consequences of climate change are understood. ""The effects of a warmer climate are localised, and there are winners and losers,"" Prof Brauer said. ""But this is an illustration that some of these impacts are becoming global."" He argued that the US lawmakers' complaints are an ""unfortunate distraction,"" and that the focus should instead be on collaboration and learning how to ""live with smoke"". ""This stuff isn't going away,"" Prof Brauer said, adding that there are ways to prevent future deaths if there is a will to adapt.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4l3j93481o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b63d/live/cad5cb80-9595-11f0-b72b-7959ebab31f0.jpg,2025-09-25T01:17:33.301000+00:00,282a2d008321ce498cc92217bcab0db728cbd0d4
15183877186b,China makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissions,,"China makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissions Mark Poynting and Matt McGrath BBC News Climate and Science European Photopress Agency China, the world's biggest source of planet-warming gases, has for the first time committed to an absolute target to cut its emissions. In a video statement to the UN in New York, President Xi Jinping said that China would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 7-10% by 2035, while ""striving to do better"". The announcement comes at a time the US is rolling back on its commitments, with President Donald Trump on Tuesday calling climate change a ""con job"". But some critics said China's plan did not go as far as hoped to keep global climate goals in reach. ""Even for those with tempered expectations, what's presented today still falls short,"" said Yao Zhe, global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. While the year's big gathering of global leaders will be at COP30 in Brazil in November, this week's UN meeting in New York has extra relevance because countries are running out of time to submit their new climate plans. These pledges - submitted every five years - are a key part of the Paris climate agreement , the landmark deal in which nearly 200 countries agreed steps to try to limit global warming. The original deadline for these new commitments - covering emissions cuts by 2035 - was back in February, but countries are now scrambling to present them by the end of September. Speaking before the meeting UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the pledges were critical to keep the long-term rise in global temperatures under 1.5C, as agreed in Paris. ""We absolutely need countries to come [...] with climate action plans that are fully aligned with 1.5 degrees, that cover the whole of their economies and the whole of their greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is essential that we have a drastic reduction of emissions in the next few years if you want to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit alive,"" he added. As the world's biggest emitter, China's plans are key to keeping this goal in sight. Back in 2021, President Xi announced that China would aim to peak its emissions this decade and reach ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060 . Today's pledge marks the first time that China has set actual emissions reductions targets on that path. ""These targets represent China's best efforts based on the requirements of the Paris agreement,"" President Xi said. It also covers all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, and will be measured ""from peak levels"" of emissions - the timing of which President Xi did not specify. He added China would: expand wind and solar power capacity to more than six times 2020 levels increase forest stocks to more than 24bn cubic metres make ""new energy vehicles"" the mainstream in new vehicle sales Off track for 1.5C Such is the scale of China's emissions that any reduction would be significant in climate terms. China was responsible for more than a quarter of planet-warming emissions in 2023, at almost 14bn tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent. A 10% reduction in China's emissions would equate to 1.4bn tonnes a year, which is nearly four times the UK's total annual emissions. But China's new target does fall short of what would be needed to meet international climate goals. ""Anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Most scenarios to limit warming to 1.5C - or even well below 2C - would require China to make much greater cuts than that by 2035, he added. In many cases, that would mean more than a 50% reduction. It is further evidence of the gap between what needs to be done to meet climate targets and what countries are planning. Earlier this week, a report by the Stockholm Environment Institute warned that governments around the world are collectively planning to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be in line with keeping to 1.5C. Ramp-up of renewables What gives some observers hope is that China has a track record of exceeding many of its international climate commitments. It had, for example, pledged to reach a capacity of 1,200 gigawatts for wind and solar power by 2030. It smashed through that goal in 2024 – six years early. ""The targets should be seen as a floor rather than a ceiling,"" said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. ""China's rapid clean tech growth […] could propel the country much further over the coming decade,"" he added. ""China's 2035 target simply isn't representative of the pace of the energy transition in the country,"" agreed Bernice Lee, distinguished fellow and senior adviser at Chatham House. ""There's a case to be made that Beijing missed a trick in landing a more ambitious goal as it would have won broad global praise - a stark contrast to the US,"" she added. While China ramps up its renewables, it continues to rely heavily on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Last year saw China's electricity generation from coal hit a new record – although initial data suggests it has fallen in the first half of 2025 amid a surge in solar electricity. ""There is also mounting evidence that the country's emissions are plateauing, with this year's levels expected to be lower than in 2024,"" said Li Shuo. Today's new target signals ""the beginning of decarbonisation after decades of rapid emissions growth"", he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y159190go,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/73e0/live/86e8f090-97d0-11f0-9dd8-57dfaa725755.jpg,2025-09-24T18:57:20.911000+00:00,469f827716d4d3b66cf6cba4aab6e0b8b86523f8
f8c03333cacd,Musk's fellowship of Royal Society in doubt after rally address,,"Elon Musk's controversial comments at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London have raised doubts over his fellowship of the Royal Society - the world's most prestigious scientific institution. Addressing the rally organised by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, Musk criticised ""uncontrolled migration"" and said: ""Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die."" In response, Sir Adrian Smith, president of the Society, wrote a letter to fellows in which he raised concerns about ""resorting to the language of violence"" and the threat it posed to the organisation's values. He said the matter would be discussed at the society's next council meeting. Elon Musk was first elected a fellow of the UK's national academy of sciences in 2018, for his work in the space and electric vehicle industries. But his continued participation in the Royal Society has grown increasingly controversial. Earlier this year, thousands of scientists signed a letter raising concerns about his involvement in funding cuts to US scientific research, as part of his previous role in Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. The Society debated his fellowship in March but it was decided he would remain. Some fellows said any attempts to remove him could be seen as a curtailment of freedom of expression. Without refencing Musk directly, Sir Adrian Smith wrote to fellows: ""I am sure that many of you will share my concern at the events of the last week and the growing tendency to resort to the language of violence in pursuit of political programmes - including, unfortunately, an address to the recent London rally from a Fellow of the Royal Society."" He went on to say that: ""Most of us have had the good fortune to have lived our lives in contexts where core values of tolerance, courtesy, respect for others, and freedom of speech have been widely acknowledged and respected and we have come to take them for granted."" ""It is no accident that human understanding and science have also flourished to an extraordinary extent in this period. Threats to these values are now real,"" he finished. Sir Adrian's letter was first reported by The New World. Addressing the crowds on Saturday via video link, Musk said: ""I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration. ""This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. ""They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business. ""My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You're in a fundamental situation here. ""Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that's the truth, I think."" Any decision to remove Mr Musk would be a significant moment in the organisation's history. It is 250 years since a member of the Royal Society was ejected: German scientist and writer Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was accused of theft and fraud.

They say this is evidence humans may have got our taste for alcohol from common primate ancestors who relied on fermented fruit - a source of sugar and alcohol - for food. ""Human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this dietary heritage of our common ancestor with chimpanzees,"" said study researcher Aleksey Maro of the University of California, Berkeley. Chimps, like many other animals, have been spotted feeding on ripe fruit lying on the forest floor, but this is the first study to make clear how much alcohol they might be consuming. The research team measured the amount of ethanol, or pure alcohol, in fruits such as figs and plums eaten in large quantities by wild chimps in Côte d'Ivoire and Uganda. Based on the amount of fruit they normally eat, the chimps were ingesting around 14 grams of ethanol - equivalent to nearly two UK units, or roughly one 330ml bottle of lager. The fruits most commonly eaten were those highest in alcohol content. Aleksey Maro Figs are a significant part of the diet for many primates, including chimpanzees The research adds weight to the so-called ""drunken monkey"" hypothesis - the idea that the human appetite for alcohol was inherited from our primate ancestors. This was first proposed by Prof Robert Dudley of the University of California, Berkeley, who is a co-researcher on the study. Scientists were initially sceptical. But more observations of ""scrumping apes"" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team. ""What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years,"" she told BBC News. ""Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits."" Getty Images Wild chimpanzees in Uganda are under threat from deforestation and climate change Dr Kimberley Hockings, who studies primates at the University of Exeter and was not involved in the research, said it was important to note that the chimpanzees in this study were not consuming enough alcohol to become drunk. Had they done so,  ""this would clearly not improve their survival chances,"" she said. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , chimpanzees are endangered and the biggest threats they face include losing their forest homes to farming, logging and building roads or towns.

9bff1ed42680,US energy chief tells BBC nuclear fusion will soon power the world,,"US energy chief tells BBC nuclear fusion will soon power the world Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor BBC/Pol Reygaerts US Energy Secretary Chris Wright spoke to BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt during an interview in Brussels Don't worry too much about planet-warming emissions, the US Energy Secretary has told the BBC, because within five years AI will have enabled the harnessing of nuclear fusion – the energy that powers the sun and stars. Chris Wright told me in an interview that he expected the technology to deliver power to electricity grids around the world within eight to 15 years and that it would rapidly become a big driver of greenhouse gas reductions. His claims will likely surprise even enthusiasts for the technology. Harnessing the energy released when atoms fuse together could produce vast amounts of low carbon energy but most scientists believe commercial fusion power plants are still a long way off. ""With artificial intelligence and what's going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years,"" said Mr Wright. ""The technology, it'll be on the electric grid, you know, in eight to 15 years."" Scientists believe nuclear fusion, which Mr Wright studied at university, could one day produce vast amounts of energy without heating up our atmosphere. But it's a very complex process. Replicating it on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun. President Donald Trump's controversial energy chief also urged the UK government to lift the de facto ban on fracking and issue new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea. The US Energy Secretary warned the Trump Administration had ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on Chinese renewable technologies. ""It looks like the Chinese could control what's going on with your energy system,"" he said. He repeated the claims made by Donald Trump that the UK and Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels to low carbon energy is driving deindustrialisation and impoverishing their citizens. Mr Wright is in Brussels ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK next week. The US President will meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and will attend a banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. Getty Images China leads the world in solar technology and exports but the Trump administration has ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on its renewable technologies During the BBC interview the US Energy Secretary said fracking – releasing oil and gas trapped rock formations underground - could have a ""tremendous"" impact on the UK economy. Mr Wright, who has founded and run fracking companies in the US, suggested the oil and gas the process would produce could ""bring back manufacturing and blue-collar jobs and drive down not just electricity prices, but home-heating prices and industrial energy prices"". Reform UK recently said it would encourage fracking in the UK if it were to win the next election, but the British Geological Survey has warned the potential for the technology to produce large amounts of oil and gas in the UK is likely to be limited. Mr Wright defended the billions of dollars of cuts the Trump Administration has made to renewable energy subsidies. He said wind power has been subsidised for 33 years and solar for 25 years. ""Isn't that enough?"" the Energy Secretary asked: ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies."" Getty Images US Energy Secretary Chris Wright stands behind President Donald Trump as he holds an executive order The Energy Secretary also stood by the report issued by the Department of Energy in July which said the threat of climate change has been exaggerated. Among a series of controversial claims, the report said sea level rise is not accelerating, that computer models of the climate exaggerate future temperature rises and that climate scientists overlook beneficial aspects of climate change like the fact that high densities of carbon dioxide promote plant growth. Earlier this month more than 85 international scientists claimed it was riddled with errors and misrepresentations and that data had been ""cherry-picked"" - selectively chosen. The scientists also called into question the academic standards of the five authors of the paper. Mr Wright told the BBC he believes it is climate scientists who use data selectively.  ""Cherry-picking data in climate science, in the media, by activists and by politicians is the norm,"" he said. He acknowledged that climate change is a ""very real, physical phenomenon"" and said that he believes the world will decarbonise: ""It's just generations from now, not two or three decades from now."" He said he was delighted his report had prompted such vigorous debate: ""We've got a dialogue back and forth about climate change in a public forum.  I've wanted that for 20 years."" He denied that the cuts the Trump Administration is making to climate science, including a proposal to slash the funding for the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), would damage US research into weather and climate. There has been speculation that the cuts could block the development of the next generation of weather satellites and could even lead to the closure of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which is responsible for the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. ""There are a lot of rumours about all sorts of terrible things happening,"" said Mr Wright, who claimed the US government is trying to restore ""real science"". He claimed: ""One of the problems of science is it's become so politicised in the climate world, if you deviate from the church, your funding gets cut off.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlz5p314z0o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b857/live/0643dc50-8f58-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg,2025-09-11T23:02:49.282000+00:00,f67b79e48ae2d7176f4abaa40519b58eac92d5cf
acc8f47ed926,Tories pledge to get all oil and gas out of North Sea,,"Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected. The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on ""maximising extraction"" to get ""all our oil and gas out of the North Sea"" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday, She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up ""paying the price through higher energy bills"". The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: ""We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy."" Exploring new fields would ""not take a penny off bills"" or improve energy security and would ""only accelerate the worsening climate crisis"", a government spokesperson warned. Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be ""impossible"" by 2050 . Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove. The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage. Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"". Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration. It is a reversal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which channelled billions of dollars into clean energy. In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments. Since then, major energy companies such as BP have U-turned on the level of investment in renewables to focus on increasing oil and gas production in order to boost profitability. Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, a research and campaign group, said Badenoch's plan was ""reckless"" and would not ""bring down energy bills"". ""These rules are the bare minimum to needed hold the industry to account, and removing them will simply mean more emissions, more environmental harm and more handouts to oil and gas giants at the nation's expense,"" she said. Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected. But Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said scrapping requirements to reduce emissions ""is nothing short of irresponsible environmental vandalism"". He said the UK ""should be setting our sights on leading the world in clean energy, in off shore wind, instead of falling back to a dependency on fossil fuels"". Research shows that 2024 was the first calendar year where global average temperatures were more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This made it the hottest year since records began in 1850, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is managed by the European Commission and uses data from the European Union's space programme. The UK was one of 200 countries to sign the Paris Agreement who agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and keep them ""well below"" 2.0C above those recorded in pre-industrial times. Gillian Martin, the Scottish government's energy secretary, said: ""Too many are offering easy answers when what we need are the right answers."" She said that because the North Sea basin is ""maturing"", the ""responsible approach is to plan now for this eventuality, transitioning to new fuels and sustainable energy in a way that protects our energy security and Scotland's highly skilled workforce in the North East"". But David Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, a trade organisation representing the industry, said: ""The choice is clear - do we prioritise our homegrown energy or choose to sacrifice our jobs to rely on imports? ""While we use oil and gas, let us produce it here in the UK responsibly, alongside an accelerated rollout of renewables. In a country importing 40% of its energy needs, we need both."" The current government said it had made the ""biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first of a kind carbon capture and storage clusters"". Carbon capture and storage facilities aim to prevent carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from industrial processes and power stations from being released into the atmosphere. Most of the CO2 produced is captured, transported and then stored deep underground. It is seen by the likes of the International Energy Agency and the Climate Change Committee as a key element in meeting targets to cut the greenhouse gases driving dangerous climate change. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns, said: ""By far the best option for British growth, British jobs is investment in that green industrial transformation. Not the technology of the old century the 20th century, we need to invest in the technology of the 21st century.""

dbde8c486b16,Military drills spark hundreds of wildfires in UK,,"Military drills spark hundreds of wildfires in UK Malcolm Prior Rural affairs producer BBC Live army manoeuvres have caused 385 wildfires on MoD training sites across the UK countryside since 2023 Live-fire military training has sparked hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with unexploded shells often making it too dangerous to tackle them. Fire crews battling a vast moorland blaze in North Yorkshire this month have been hampered by exploding bombs and tank shells dating back to training on the moors during the Second World War. Figures obtained by the BBC show that of the 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land between January 2023 and last month, 385 were caused by present-day army manoeuvres themselves. The MoD said it has a robust wildfire policy which monitors risk levels and limits live ammunition use when necessary. HIWFRS Wildfires left to burn can cause large amounts of smoke pollution and have a significant environmental impact But locals near the sites of recent fires told the BBC they felt the MoD needed to do more to prevent them, including completely banning live fire training in the driest months. Wildfires in the countryside can start for many reasons, including discarded cigarettes, unattended campfires and BBQs and deliberate arson, and the scale of them can be made worse by dry, hot conditions and the amount of vegetation on the land. But according to data obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act, there have been 1,178 wildfires in total linked to present-day MoD training sites since 2020 – with 101 out of 134 wildfires in the first six months of this year caused by military manoeuvres or training. More than 80 of the fires caused by training itself so far this year have been in so-called ""Range Danger Areas"" - also known as ""impact zones"". These are areas where the level of danger means the local fire service is usually not allowed access and the fire is left to burn out on its own, albeit contained by firebreaks. The large amounts of smoke produced can lead to road closures, disruption and health risks to local residents, who are directed to keep their windows shut despite it often being the hottest time of the year. One villager who lives near the MoD's training site on Salisbury Plain said wildfires there, like the recent one in May , were ""a perennial problem"" and the MoD had to do more to control them and restrict the use of live ordnance to outside of the hottest months. Neil Lockhart, from Great Cheverell, near Devizes in Wiltshire, said the smoke from fires left to burn was a major environmental issue and posed a risk to the health and safety of locals. Villager Neil Lockhart has asthma and says the smoke produced by the wildfires causes him particular challenges ""It's the pollution. If you suffer like I do with asthma, and it's the height of the summer and you've got to keep all your windows closed, then it's an issue,"" explained Mr Lockhart. Arable farmer Tim Daw, whose land at All Cannings overlooks the MoD training site on Salisbury Plain, said he ""must have seen three or four big fires this year"" but found the smoke only a ""mild annoyance"". He said many locals were worried about the impact of the wildfires on wildlife and the landscape, saying the extent of the area affected by the blazes often looked ""fairly horrendous"", and likened it to a ""burnt savannah"". But he said the MoD was ""very proactive"" in keeping locals informed about the risks of wildfires and any ongoing problems on their land. Wartime ""legacy"" Aside from the problem of live military training sparking fires, old unexploded ordnance left behind from previous manoeuvres make wildfires harder to fight, This month has seen a major fire burning on Langdale Moor, in the North York Moors National Park, since Monday, 11 August. It has seen a number of bombs explode in areas that were once used for military training dating back to the Second World War. One local landowner, George Winn-Darley, said the peat fire had produced ""an enormous cloud of pollution"" that could have been prevented if there had not been live ordnance on site. ""If that unexploded ordnance had been cleared up and wasn't there then this wildfire would have been able to be dealt with, probably completely, nearly two weeks ago,"" he told the BBC. Mr Winn-Darley called for the MoD to clear up any major munitions left on the moors. ""That would seem to be the absolute minimum that they should be doing,"" he said. ""It seems ridiculous that here we are, 80 years after the end of the Second World War, and we're still dealing with this legacy."" A MoD spokesperson said the fire at Langdale had not started on land currently owned by the MoD but that an Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team had responded on four occasions to requests for assistance from North Yorkshire Police. ""Various Second World War-era unexploded ordnance items were discovered as a result of the wildfires, which the EOD operator declared to be inert practice projectiles. They were retrieved for subsequent disposal,"" he explained. He added that the MoD monitors the risk of fires across its training estate throughout the year and restricts the use of ordnance, munitions and explosives when training is taking place during periods of elevated wildfire risk. ""Impact areas"" are constructed with fire breaks, such as stone tracks, around them to prevent the wider spread of fire and grazing is used to keep the amount of combustible vegetation down. Earlier this month, the MoD launched its ""Respect the Range"" campaign , designed to raise the public's awareness of the dangers of accessing military land, such as live firing, unexploded ordnance and wildfires. A spokeswoman for the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said it worked closely with the MoD to ""understand the risk and locations of munitions and to create plans to effectively extinguish fires"". ""We always encourage military colleagues to account for the conditions and the potential for wildfire when considering when to carry out their training,"" she added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08j04je2jo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4a40/live/aee52200-835b-11f0-b3de-c13d348c14aa.jpg,2025-08-30T00:55:53.136000+00:00,cdedbf97f940c747cf06f0bab09673c0559c7a44

Helen Briggs BBC environment correspondent and Gwyndaf Hughes Science videographer BBC The Druids Oak is the oldest living tree in this woodland in Buckinghamshire Dr Ed Pyne snips a leaf from the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree that has watched over this woodland in Buckinghamshire for centuries, enduring droughts, storms, heatwaves and more. ""We know that this tree is a survivor,"" he says, taking a leaf sample for DNA testing. ""Is it just that it's got lucky? Has it led a stress-free life? Or is there something special about the genes of this tree?"" The conservation scientist from the charity, The Woodland Trust, thinks the secrets of such remarkable resilience lie in its DNA. The experts want to understand how oaks can live for 1,000 years or more, resisting threats such as climate change and bouncing back from disease - knowledge that could be vital in restoring Britain's depleted woodlands. ""By exploring the genome of ancient trees, we can understand how to manage them better so that we can secure their future for generations to come,"" says Dr Emma Gilmartin of the tree charity, the Arboricultural Association, which is involved in the project. Dr Emma Gilmartin says ancient trees like the Druids Oak are monuments of nature English oaks are one of the UK's best-loved trees, growing widely in parks, gardens and the countryside. They are classed as ancient when they reach around 400 years of age. By studying the DNA of ancient oaks, the scientists hope to unravel the genes behind the trees' long life and their ability to survive climatic extremes. This information would be used to select the best oak trees to plant in the future, to restore woodlands and bring back wildlife. About 50 of the UK's most well-known ancient oaks will be studied, including: The Druids Oak Dr Ed Pyne and Dr Emma Gilmartin measure the girth of the tree, which comes in at   9m Located within a nature reserve in Buckinghamshire managed by the City of London Corporation The tree likely dates to the 13th Century, making it older than many historical buildings The tree has a girth and height of about 9m It has been pollarded, meaning its upper branches were historically cut back to encourage regrowth above the reach of grazing animals, giving it a distinctive squat shape Oaks were revered by ancient druids, which may have inspired the tree's name. The Crouch Oak The tree is now hollow due to age and decay, but it remains a cherished local landmark Found off a busy high street in Addlestone, Surrey One of the oldest in the borough, it is believed to be at least 800 years old The name ""Crouch Oak"" may come from the Middle English word crouche, meaning cross, possibly indicating its use as a boundary marker It is also referred to as Queen Elizabeth's Picnic Tree, after Elizabeth I is said to have dined beneath it. As well as their cultural and historical value, oaks are a haven for wildlife. They support more life than any other native tree species in the UK, hosting more than 2,300 species, including birds, mammals, insects, fungi, and lichens. Their leaves feed caterpillars, their bark shelters bats and beetles, and their acorns sustain mammals and birds through the winter. Some of these species are very rare, such as the Moccas Beetle, which lives on just 14 old oak trees in Moccas Park, Herefordshire. Britain is a stronghold for ancient oaks, holding more than the rest of Europe combined At the National Nature Reserve adjoining Moccas Park, conservationists are putting oaks at the heart of an effort to restore the landscape. They are restoring a natural wildlife-rich habitat made up of open grasslands populated with ancient trees, known as wood pasture. Acorns of ancient oaks that have stood for centuries in the area are being collected and grown into young oak trees, then put back where they once stood. Conifers that weren't part of the natural habitat were once planted here, but these are being removed and woodlands restored. This has led to a resurgence of rare species, including hundreds of different flies and beetles, rare bats and woodland birds. ""We're really seeing a sort of boom in the bird population here,"" says Tom Simpson of Natural England, the UK government agency responsible for protecting and improving England's natural environment. ""In a short period of time – that's 16 years of restoration - we are really seeing nature recovery on this site. "" The National Nature Reserve near Moccas in Herefordshire is a haven for rare birds and insects Young oak trees grown from ancient oaks show the way to restore woodlands As climate change and habitat loss become bigger problems, conservationists want better protection and care for ancient trees. Old trees can't be replaced - they take decades or even centuries to grow and support many other living things. Saul Herbert of The Woodland Trust says more needs to be done to protect these  ""living legends"". ""We need to find out where they are and we need to engage with people and communities to ensure that these trees are valued and looked after for the ecological, cultural and the historic value that they bring to our landscapes,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xz8r7egpo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ead/live/6e288800-849c-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,2025-08-29T00:10:56.472000+00:00,0589bfb66b1d24ff7ebd8422582531476f63c9de

The dinosaur, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been given the name Istiorachis macarthurae with the first word meaning ""sail spine"" and the second referring to Dame Ellen's surname. The record-breaking round-the-world yachtswoman said it was a ""huge honour"", adding: ""The fact that the Istiorachis 'sail' could be likened to the sails I have spent so much of my life below was very touching."" After being analysed it has now been officially named and described by island-based scientist Jeremy Lockwood, and is now on display at Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown. PA/James Brown Jeremy Lockwood with the spinal column of an Istiorachis macaruthurae The medium-sized herbivore once roamed the floodplains of what is now the island's south-west coast. Its remains, which date back 125 million years, were originally discovered by fossil hunter Nick Chase , who died of cancer in 2019. Before Dr Lockwood's analysis the fossils were assumed to have belonged to one of the two known iguanodontian dinosaur species from the Isle of Wight. He said: ""While the skeleton wasn't as complete as some of the others that have been found, no-one had really taken a close look at these bones before. ""It was thought to be just another specimen of one of the existing species, but this one had particularly long neural spines, which was very unusual. ""It may have been used for display, much like a peacock's feathers, possibly to attract mates or intimidate rivals."" For the study, researchers compared the fossilised bones with a database of similar dinosaur back bones which allowed them to see how these sail-like formations had evolved. EMCTrust Dame Ellen MacArthur, who is from Derbyshire, said it was ""both extraordinary and a huge honour"" to have the dinosaur named after her Dame Ellen, founder and patron of the East Cowes based charity the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, said: ""It is certainly not an everyday occurrence to be asked if a newly discovered dinosaur could reference your name in its title. ""I was somewhat taken aback when this conversation began, but felt hugely privileged to be asked.

083930a8829e,Scientists make 'superfood' that could save honeybees,,"Scientists make 'superfood' that could save honeybees Georgina Rannard Climate and science correspondent Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Scientists have developed a honeybee ""superfood"" that could protect the animals against the threats of climate change and habitat loss. Bee colonies that ate the supplement during trials had up to 15 times more baby bees that grew to adulthood. Honeybees are a vital part of food production and contribute to the pollination by animals of 70% of leading global crops. ""This technological breakthrough provides all the nutrients bees need to survive, meaning we can continue to feed them even when there's not enough pollen,"" senior author Professor Geraldine Wright at the University of Oxford told BBC News. ""It really is a huge accomplishment,"" she says. Gywndaf Hughes/BBC Honeybees globally are facing severe declines, due to nutrient deficiencies, viral diseases, climate change and other factors. In the US, annual colony losses have ranged between 40-50% in the last decade and are expected to increase. Beekeepers in the UK have faced serious challenges too. Nick Mensikov, chair of the Cardiff, Vale and Valleys Beekeepers Association, told BBC News that he lost 75% of his colonies last winter and that this has been seen across South Wales. ""Although the hives have all been full of food, the bees have just dwindled. Most of the bees survived through January, February, and then they just vanished,"" he says. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Nick Mensikov has kept hives for 15 years and sells honey in South Wales Honeybees feed on pollen and nectar from flowers that contain the nutrients, including lipids called sterols that are necessary for their development. They make honey in hives, which becomes their food source over winter when flowers have stopped producing pollen. When beekeepers take out honey to sell, or, increasingly, when there isn't enough pollen available, they give the insects supplementary food. But that food is made up of protein flour, sugar and water, and has always lacked the nutrients bees require. It is like humans eating a diet without carbohydrates, amino acids, or other vital nutrients. Sterol has always proved very difficult to manufacture, but Prof Wright has led a group of scientists for 15 years to identify which exact sterols bees need and how to engineer them. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Professor Geraldine Wright was inspired to work on bee nutrition after beekeepers told her about how many of their bees were dying In the lab at Oxford, PhD student Jennifer Chennells showed us small clear boxes of honeybees in an incubator that she feeds with different foods she has made. She uses kitchen equipment you could find at home to make the ingredients, and rolls out glossy, white tubes of food. ""We put ingredients into what's like a cookie dough, with different proteins, fats, different amounts of carbohydrate, and the micronutrients that bees need. It's to try to work out what they like best and what's best for them,"" she says. She pushes the tubes inside the boxes and bees nibble at the mixture. It's in this lab that, using gene editing, Prof Wright's team successfully made a yeast that can produce the six sterols that bees need. ""It's a huge breakthrough. When my student was able to engineer the yeast to create the sterols, she sent me a picture of the chromatogram that was a result of the work,"" she says, referring to a chart of the substance structure. ""I still have it on the wall of my office,"" she explains. See inside the hive that tested honeybee 'superfood' The ""superfood"" was fed to bees in the lab's hives for three months. The results showed that colonies fed the food had up to 15 times more baby bees that made it to adulthood. ""When the bees have a complete nutrition they should be healthier and less susceptible to disease,"" Prof Wright says. Prof Wright says the food would be particularly useful during summers like this one when flowering plants appear to have stopped producing early. Gwyndaf Hughes/BBC Beekeepers often feed supplementary food to bees to sustain them ""It's really important in years when the summer came early and bees will not have sufficient pollen and nectar to make it through the winter,"" she says. ""The more months that they go without pollen, the more nutritional stress that they will face, which means that the beekeepers will have greater losses of those bees over winter,"" she explains. Larger-scale trials are now needed to assess the long-term impacts of the food on honeybee health, but the supplement could be available to beekeepers and farmers within two years. The study was led by University of Oxford, working with Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, University of Greenwich, and the Technical University of Denmark.

fdc767bcf2f3,Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets,,"Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Elisenda Balleste The researchers worked from a vessel at a number of locations around the Antarctic Peninsula Kate Stephens and Gwyndaf Hughes BBC News science team Why would anyone brave hand-numbing cold, icy winds and rough seas - sometimes working through the night - to dig up mud from the Antarctic seabed? That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling -  affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. The research is part of a global effort to understand the relationship between the ocean and the climate. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. They collected more than 40 long cores, or tubes, of seafloor sediment from locations around the peninsula. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Collecting the sediment gives insight and clues to the past, ""like a book of history"", explained lead researcher Dr Elisenda Balleste from the University of Barcelona. ""What is living in the seas now, what was living in the seas in the past and evidence of our human impact"" is recorded in layer upon layer of sediment over centuries, she said. By preserving and dating those layers, and analysing what they contain, researchers can build a picture of the history of Antarctic marine life. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. From there, carefully extracted pieces of this Antarctic mud will be sent out to several academic institutions around the world. Scientists will scan and date the sediment layers, work out what microbial life they contain, measure levels of pollution and calculate how much carbon is buried in the mud. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. Claire Allen, an oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey who has studied Antarctica's past for more than 20 years, said that cores like these were particularly valuable. ""Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time,"" she said. Elisenda Balleste Scientists carefully slice the sediment cores in a lab on board the ship The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes. Dr Balleste took them out of the industrial-sized freezer where they are being stored to show them to us, very briefly. ""They're kept at minus 80 degrees to stop them degrading,"" she explained. These small pieces of the seabed - frozen in time at temperatures that preserve genetic material - will be used for what is known as environmental DNA analysis. It is an area of science which has developed rapidly in recent years. It gives researchers the ability to extract genetic information from water, soil and even air, like a fingerprint of life left behind in the environment. Getty Images Industrial whaling in Antarctica drove many species to the brink of extinction Dr Carlos Preckler, from King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia, is leading this part of the research and will be trying to measure how almost a century of industrial whaling in Antarctica affected the ocean and our atmosphere. Carbon - when it is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide - warms up our planet like a blanket. So, as the world struggles to reduce those emissions, any processes that absorb and lock significant amounts of carbon might help to rein in global warming. ""We know whales have a lot of carbon in their bodies, because they are huge animals,"" said Dr Preckler. What he and his colleagues want to know is how much of that carbon gets buried in the seafloor - and locked away from the atmosphere - when the animals die. ""We can measure whale DNA and the carbon in the sediment,"" explained Dr Preckler. ""So we can measure what happened before industrial whaling removed most of the whales in the [Southern] ocean,"" he added. That, the researchers say, will provide a measure of how much whales - simply by existing, being huge and living out their natural lives - remove carbon from our atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2vz9jg8jzo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4be9/live/74786430-7788-11f0-907d-6ff0082c2def.jpg,2025-08-18T23:21:37.548000+00:00,c086f572bee7c3806a192937427f7e57e1061f12

The offences, which occurred between 2022 and 2024 at the energy-from-waste plant, were revealed last week after the operator Viridor admitted it had been collecting pollution data incorrectly. Sutton Council, who sends waste to the site, has written to the Environment Secretary Steve Reed urging him to take enforcement action and say it was only told about the breaches 16 months after they were discovered. A Viridor spokesperson said it takes environmental responsibility seriously and the under-reporting was ""human error"". The plant provides waste disposal services for 400,000 households across four councils - Croydon, Sutton, Merton and Kingston. In order to operate, it has to record daily air pollution from burning the waste for key pollutants and ensure these remain below certain levels. In March, Viridor realised that its monitoring software was incorrectly calibrated and that a reassessment revealed it had been breached daily pollution limits for nitrogen oxides regularly between August 2022 and March 2024. The Environment Agency (EA) was notified and a subsequent investigation confirmed 16 breaches of its licence - one for each quarter across its two incinerators. The regulator told the BBC it was considering further enforcement action. This could include a fine and, as a last resort, criminal proceedings - although such action is rarely taken. A Viridor spokesperson said: ""The Environment Agency has acknowledged the breaches at Beddington resulted from human error on the part of the third-party contractor, corroborating the independent environmental consultant's investigation."" It went on to say it takes environmental responsibility seriously. 'Potential harm' Sutton Council told the BBC it was only notified of the breaches this month - some 16 months after Viridor first found the issue. On Friday, council leader Barry Lewis wrote to the company and the Environment Secretary who represents neighbouring Streatham and Croydon North, raising concerns about the health impacts and reiterating its opposition to the proposed expansion of the site. In his letter to Mr Reed, Mr Lewis said the news is ""still deeply troubling"" for residents. ""What is also concerning is the lack of proper monitoring and scrutiny by the EA. it is important that our residents have confidence in the ability of government regulators. This report only contributes to the erosion of that trust,"" he wrote. The government has yet to respond. Nitrogen dioxide has been associated with adverse health effects including increased respiratory symptoms. The UK Health Security Agency assessed local monitors following the revelation, and confirmed that daily air quality limits were not breached and ""the emissions are unlikely to have caused harm to human health or the environment."" But it also said ""an exposed population is likely to be subject to potential harm at any level.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627evk7yrzo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e0e1/live/0b410df0-83fe-11f0-a3f8-9b56bf5c3841.jpg,2025-08-28T12:48:19.198000+00:00,146251721ae7a5987049ebb772028c9d1c3bc7f6

The world's largest and most powerful rocket blasted off from Texas just after 18:30 local time (00:30 BST) for a nail-biting 60-minute flight. Parts of the engine appeared to explode at one stage, and flaps on the side of the rocket caught fire and swung from side-to-side. US space agency Nasa plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon for its Artemis programme in 2027. ""Great work by the SpaceX team!!"", posted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on X, who is spending billions on developing Starship, which each launch costing an estimated $100m. He will be welcoming the success after three Starship launches ended in spectacular failure this year, and one rocket exploded on its test stand in June. Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket built to date. It is made up of a  booster called Super Heavy and the spacecraft Starship. The signs were positive from the start of Tuesday's test flight. All of the booster's 33 engines fired up, and after about seven minutes, the booster separated from the spacecraft and fell into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship continued to ascend, reaching a maximum height of almost 200km above Earth, before coasting around the planet. SpaceX said it intended to put the rocket under stress to test its limits, and parts of the rocket's flaps appeared to burn and swing wildly during the descent. The company has designed Starship to one day be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying people to the Moon and Mars. ""This was a great day for SpaceX, executing its full mission for the first time and deploying some test dummy satellites along the route,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at the Open University. He adds that SpaceX will have gathered a full set of data from take-off, cruising and landing, which is a big step forward for the company. The first version of the rocket had five successful launches, but all attempts to launch the newest version had ended in spectacular explosions. In March, one explosion grounded flights and caused debris to rain down over the Bahamas with pieces landing in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. But SpaceX did successfully execute the ""chopstick"" manoeuvre that caught the rocket booster in mechanical arms when it returned to Earth. Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket system which has ever flown It is high stakes for US space agency Nasa, too. It has contracted SpaceX to use a modified version of Starship to take humans to the Moon as part its Artemis programme in 2027, although most observers say that date is almost certain to slip. ""This is also a big step forward for Nasa's Artemis program, but there's still a lot of development work to happen to get this spacecraft ready and to be rated to carry humans safely to the Moon,"" Dr Barber says. Mr Musk wants Starship to be certified for human travel as early as next year, and has also suggested it will start un-crewed flights to Mars in the next 12 months. SpaceX's mantra has been to fail fast, learn fast. Rather than taking a cautious approach, it has always aimed to move quickly and when rockets have exploded, the company says it is simply a chance to collect performance data. But after three failures in a row this year, questions were being asked about the future of SpaceX and about whether Mr Musk had been spending too much time on US politics. The world's richest man was a key supporter of US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election campaign, and until a falling out in June, the two men were close allies. Starship returned to Earth battered and bruised on Tuesday but it was a big step forward for the company that needs to prove it can safely and reliably take humans to the Moon. Tuesday's success ""gets the programme back on track - getting to the Moon is another question,"" suggests Dr Ken Kremer, research scientist and founder of website Space UpClose. He says the US reaching the moon in 2027 is ""extremely unlikely. I don't want to say it's impossible but it's extremely unlikely"". The US is racing against China to be the first to return humans to the Moon, and some scientists say that even with Starship's progress, it is likely that China will win.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly69z9lwnno,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/65a1/live/b78d26f0-82e8-11f0-ab3e-bd52082cd0ae.jpg,2025-08-27T13:00:47.828000+00:00,4527dbca0e647bc064280331f8527aed707464fb
9b89234f54ef,"Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, dies aged 97",,"Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 astronaut, dies aged 97 Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth ""Houston, we've had a problem"" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Astronaut Jim Lovell, who guided the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth in 1970, has died aged 97. Nasa said he had ""turned a potential tragedy into a success"" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. Lovell, who was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, was the first man to go to the Moon twice - but never actually landed. Acting Nasa head Sean Duffy said Lovell had helped the US space programme to ""forge a historic path"". In a statement, Lovell's family said: ""We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind."" Tom Hanks, who played Lovell in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 , called the astronaut one of those people ""who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own"". Hanks said in a statement on Instagram that Lovell's many voyages ""were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive"". NASA Teenage rocket maker One Saturday, a 16-year-old hauled a heavy, three-foot tube into the middle of a large field in Wisconsin. He had persuaded his science teacher to help him make a makeshift rocket. Somehow, he had managed to get his hands on the ingredients for gunpowder - potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal. He pulled on a welder's helmet for protection. He packed it with powder, struck a match and ran like hell. The rocket rose 80 feet into the air and exploded. Had the chemicals been packed slightly differently, he would have been blown to pieces. For Jim Lovell, this was more than a childish lark. In achieving his dream to be a rocket scientist, he would become an American hero. But it was not going to be easy. Getty Images The crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13: Jack Swigert, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic. ""Boys like either dinosaurs or airplanes,"" he said. ""I was very much an airplane boy."" When he was five years old, his father died in a car accident. His mother, Blanche, worked all hours, struggling to keep food on the table. University was well beyond their financial reach. The answer was the US Navy, which was hungry for new pilots after World War Two. It was not building rockets but at least it involved flying. Lovell signed up to a programme that sent him to college at the military's expense while training as a fighter pilot. Two years in, he gambled and switched to the Navy Academy at Annapolis, on Chesapeake Bay, in the hope of working with his beloved rockets. It was a lucky decision. A few months later, the Korean War broke out and his former fellow apprentice pilots were sent to South East Asia. Many never got to finish their education. Marriage was banned at Annapolis and girlfriends discouraged. The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities. But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he had shyly asked to the prom. Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes. Somehow the relationship survived. Just hours after his graduation in 1952, the newly commissioned Ensign Lovell married her. They would be together for more than 70 years, until Marilyn's death in 2023. Getty Images Jim and Marilyn Lovell were high school sweethearts He did everything he could to advertise his love of rocketry. His thesis at the Navy Academy was in the unheard-of topic of liquid-fuel engines. After graduation, he hoped to specialise in this pioneering new technology. But the navy had other ideas. Lovell was assigned to an aircraft carrier group flying Banshee jets off ships at night. It was a white-knuckle, high-wire business fit only for daredevils. But for Lovell, it was not enough. Kennedy's men In 1958, he applied to Nasa. Project Mercury was America's attempt to place a man in orbit around the Earth. Jim Lovell was one of the 110 test pilots considered for selection but a temporary liver condition put paid to his chances. Four years later, he tried again. In June 1962, after gruelling medical tests, Nasa announced its ""New Nine"". These would be the men to deliver on President Kennedy's pledge to put American boots on the Moon. It was the most elite group of flying men ever assembled. They included Neil Armstrong, John Young and, fulfilling his childhood dream, Jim Lovell. Getty Images Apollo 8 was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet Three years later he was ready. His first trip into space was aboard the two-man Gemini 7. Lovell and fellow astronaut Frank Borman ate a steak-and-eggs breakfast and blasted off. Their mission: to find out if men could survive two weeks in space. If not, the Moon was out of reach. With the endurance record complete, Lovell's next flight was in command of Gemini 12 alongside space rookie Buzz Aldrin. This time they proved that man could work outside a spacecraft. Aldrin clambered awkwardly into the void, spending five hours photographing star fields. Now for the Moon itself. The crew of Apollo 8 would be the first to travel beyond low Earth orbit and enter the gravitational pull of another celestial body. It was Nasa's most dangerous mission yet. 'Get the camera' The Saturn V rocket that shot Lovell, Borman and William Anders out of our atmosphere at 25,000mph (40,233km/h) was huge - three times larger than anything seen on the Gemini programme. As navigator, Lovell took with him a sextant to take star readings - in case the computers failed and they had to find their own way home. Sixty-eight hours after take-off, they made it. The engines fired and Apollo 8 slid silently behind the Moon. The men heard a crackle in their headsets as the radio signal to Mission Control faltered and then failed. The spellbound astronauts pinned themselves to the windows, the first humans to see the far side of our nearest celestial neighbour. And then, from over the advancing horizon, an incredible sight. ""Earthrise,"" gasped Borman. ""Get the camera, quick,"" said Lovell. Getty Images The image of Earth from Space captivated the World It was Christmas Eve 1968. America was mired in Vietnam abroad and civil unrest at home. But at that moment, it seemed that humanity was united. The people of the world saw their planet as the astronauts saw it - fragile and beautiful, shining in the desolation of space. Lovell read from the Book of Genesis, the basis of many of the world's great religions, to the people of the Earth. ""And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."" For him, it was an image that changed our world forever. He put his thumb against the window and the whole world disappeared behind it. It was the most moving experience of his life. As the spacecraft re-emerged from the darkness, Lovell was first to announce the good news. ""Please be advised,"" he said as the radio crackled back into life, ""there is a Santa Claus."" At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. He walked past the dozens of reporters camped outside and handed a box to Marilyn. She opened the star-patterned tissue paper and pulled out a mink jacket. ""Happy Christmas,"" said the card that came with it, ""and love from the Man in the Moon."" Getty Images President Lyndon B Johnson, like millions of others, sat glued to his television sets during the Apollo 8 mission They went up as astronauts and came down celebrities. The people of the Earth had followed their every move on TV. There were ticker tape parades, congressional honours and a place on the cover of Time Magazine. And they had not even set foot on the Moon. That honour went, of course, to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. A year later, Kennedy's dream was posthumously seen to fruition. A small step was taken and mankind took its giant leap. The New Nine had done their job. 'Houston, we've had a problem' In April 1970, it was Jim Lovell's turn. Fortunately, the crew of Apollo 13 did not believe in unlucky numbers. Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were men of science - highly trained and determined to follow Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface. But things went badly wrong. They were 200,000 miles above the Earth and closing in on their target when they needed to stir tanks containing vital oxygen and hydrogen. Swigert flicked the switch. It should have been a routine procedure but the command module, Odyssey, shuddered. Oxygen pressure fell and power shut down. ""I believe we've had a problem here,"" said Swigert. Lovell had to repeat the message to a stunned Mission Control: ""Houston, we've had a problem."" It was one of the greatest understatements of all time. The crew were in big trouble - a dramatic explosion had disabled their craft. Getty Images Flight controllers at Nasa working out how to get the crippled Apollo 13 back to Earth. Haise and Lovell worked frantically to boot up the lunar module, Aquarius. It was not supposed to be used until they got to the Moon. It had no heat shield, so could not be used to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. But it could keep them alive until they got there. The world stopped breathing and watched. For a second time, Jim Lovell had brought the world together as one. The first time it had been for Earthrise, the second would be to witness his fight to survive. “For four days,"" said Marilyn, ""I didn’t know if I was a wife or a widow."" Temperatures fell to freezing, food and water were rationed. It was days before they limped back to the fringes of Earth's atmosphere. They climbed back aboard the Odyssey and prayed the heat shield had not been damaged. The radio silence that accompanies re-entry went on far longer than normal. Millions watched on TV, many convinced that all was lost. After six agonising minutes, Jack Swigert's voice cut through the silence. The team on the ground held its breath until the parachutes deployed and the crew was safely down. The mission was Nasa's greatest failure and, without question, its finest hour. Getty Images Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert are rescued from the Pacific Ocean after their dramatic escape Lovell retired from the navy in 1973 and opted for a the quiet life, working for the Bay-Houston Towing Company, giving speeches and serving as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. His book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, became the famous 1995 movie, starring Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. For the film, the director asked him to dress up as an admiral. It was for a cameo scene, shaking hands with Hanks when the crew were rescued from the sea. But the old American hero was not having it. Jim Lovell had been to the Moon twice, witnessed Earthrise and narrowly avoided a cold death in space - and saw no reason to falsely burnish his résumé . He took out his old navy uniform, dusted it down and put it on for the cameo appearance. ""I retired as a captain,"" he insisted, ""and a captain I will be.""

24725bf26a31,Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men,,"Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men NASA Who will be the next human to leave their footprint on the surface of the Moon? They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. The death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell , who guided the stricken mission safely back to Earth in 1970 , means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. More than 50 years since a human last set foot on the Moon, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is heating up once again. Nasa hopes its Artemis programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030, having landed a probe on the far side of the Moon in June 2024. A number of private companies have tried to send scientific craft to the Moon, although the mishaps have outnumbered the successes . Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but that date has slipped into 2026 , as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Meanwhile, companies such as SpaceX and Boeing continue to develop their own technology, although not without their setbacks. The issues with Boeing's Starliner which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the ""rapid unscheduled disassemblies"" of SpaceX's Starship have become a customary sight to space watchers. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. NASA Apollo 13 was Jim Lovell's final mission Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth ""Houston, we've had a problem"" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. But what of the remaining five Moon men? Who are they, and what are their stories? Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11) NASA Buzz Aldrin, right, along with his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, before their mission to the Moon On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. Allow X content?

""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time.. Charles Duke (Apollo 16) There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" NASA Charlie Duke, along with Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in Mission Control, during the Apollo 11 mission In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC . In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise NASA Fred Haise and his crewmates seemed surprised by their celebrity after they returned to Earth. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17) NASA Harrison Schmitt was the first scientist to visit the Moon Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott (Apollo 15) NASA David Scott was the seventh person to walk on the Moon David Scott, the commander of Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon.

30ac8da6bf8a,Nasa to put nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 - US media,,"Nasa to put nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 - US media Georgina Rannard Science correspondent NASA A concept image of NASA's Fission Surface Power Project US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media. It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface. According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries ""could potentially declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon. But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon's surface, with some planning permanent human settlements. ""To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,"" US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times. Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts. The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor. And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035. Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface. One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging. CNSA/CLEP In 2020 China planted a flag on the Moon on its Chang'e-5 mission ""Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,"" suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the university of Surrey ""Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,"" he adds. Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 ""given the commitment of enough money"", and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors. ""It's just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,"" he adds, referring to Nasa's Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon. There are also some questions around safety. ""Launching radioactive material through the Earth's atmosphere brings safety concerns. You have to have a special license to do that, but it is not insurmountable,"" says Dr Simeon Barber, planetary science specialist at the Open University. Mr Duffy's directive came as a surprise following recent turmoil in Nasa after Mr Trump's administration announced cuts of 24% to Nasa's budgets in 2026. That includes cuts to a significant number of science programmes such as the Mars Sample Return that aims to return samples from the planet's surface to Earth. Scientists are also concerned that this announcement is a politically-motivated move in the new international race to the Moon. ""It seems that we're going back into the old first space race days of competition, which, from a scientific perspective, is a little bit disappointing and concerning,"" says Dr Barber. ""Competition can create innovation, but if there's a narrower focus on national interest and on establishing ownership, then you can lose sight of the bigger picture which is exploring the solar system and beyond,"" he adds. Mr Duffy's comments about the potential for China and Russia to potentially ""declare a keep-out zone"" on the Moon appear to be referring to an agreement called the Artemis accords. In 2020 seven nations signed the agreement to establish principles on how countries should co-operate on the Moon's surface. The accords include so-called safety zones to be established around operations and assets that countries build on the Moon. ""If you build a nuclear reactor or or any kind of base on the moon, you can then start claiming that you have a safety zone around it, because you have equipment there,"" says Dr Barber. ""To some people, this is tantamount to, 'we own this bit of the moon, we're going to operate here and and you can't come in',"" he explains. Dr Barber points out that there are hurdles to overcome before placing a nuclear reactor on the Moon for humans to use. Nasa's Artemis 3 aims to send humans to the lunar surface in 2027, but it has faced a series of set-backs and uncertainty around funding. ""If you've got nuclear power for a base, but you've got no way of getting people and equipment there, then it's not much use,"" he added. ""The plans don't appear very joined up at the moment,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev2dylxv74o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7fdf/live/4bea4430-71ec-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.png,2025-08-05T11:36:24.551000+00:00,396e7ddcaa00ffe104fcff1b293a1d2876dfb1d1
66f75494cd87,Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere,,"Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere Maddie Molloy Climate & science reporter Getty Images The Soviet Union launched a number of missions to explore Venus – this probe was from an earlier flight Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries"".

f2295447d595,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,,"The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent BBC Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Reuters Nasa estimates that there are at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. Breathtakingly ambitious tech As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. NASA Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope detected the gas on K2-18b in this week's discovery But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. More discoveries, more questions Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Reuters Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. Getty Images A working prototype of the ExoMars rover A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. NASA/ Reuters JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. Reducing human 'specialness' If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" NASA The prospect of finding alien life is not far away, according to some scientists Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. NASA Many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". NASA As exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

971f3e593c8b,Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth,,"Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Greg Brosnan BBC Science Watch: Astronauts return to Earth after extended stay in Space After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth. Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft. After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. ""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference. It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days. It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems. ""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate. Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"". The journey home took 17 hours. The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment. They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families. NASA Triumphant - Suni Williams exits the capsule ""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut. ""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time."" The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space. NASA Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been on the ISS since June 2024 They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home . And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust. ""Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,"" he told the BBC. ""Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment. ""But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing."" In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home. Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: ""I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1dd0/live/d396c300-0490-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,2025-03-19T00:14:48.610000+00:00,7c4f000ec9d471f43aeb4fc8232cb993bc50e327

The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures. WWF Dr Cait McCarry catching krill in a net in Antarctica in order to study the animals ""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica. WWF The scientists have started by studying how krill change the colour of seawater The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space. Victoria Gill/BBC The fluke of a humpback whale, which is feeding on krill in Antarctica Krill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them. They are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill,  krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants. However, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable. Mr Downie said: ""We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas. ""[This project could] give us a new tool to help monitor and safeguard this vital species.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g41845jdo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7cd9/live/86e274b0-e225-11ef-87aa-53645de28b43.jpg,2025-02-04T01:59:32.359000+00:00,bc28ef3096f1e2044e7a5806da298a5948d0d963
757f6088f0db,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists",,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists Rebecca Morelle Science Editor and Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona Asteroid Bennu is a 500m-wide pile of boulders, rocks and rubble The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals. Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds. These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA. This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago. Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System. ""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?"" The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. NASA/Erika Blumenfeld/Joseph Aebersold The grains of Bennu contain a vast array of organic molecules Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted. A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023. About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove. ""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks. About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK. Natural History Museum/Tobias Salge Scanning electron microscopes revealed the minerals in the Bennu sample The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds. These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA  - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too. Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now. ""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell. This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth. ""The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,"" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum. The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible. But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too. ""Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,"" said Dr King. ""And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?"" It's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer. They have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vd1zjlr5lo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4283/live/85215210-dca6-11ef-8d55-c509ea2c94a9.jpg,2025-01-29T16:07:12.197000+00:00,1cf9aadd01ea441b80d04b7cdf7efc1f98b3b254

But the Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The mission came hours after the first flight of the Blue Origin New Glenn rocket system, backed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. The two tech billionaires both want to dominate the space vehicle market. ""Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause,"" SpaceX posted on X. ""With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability."" Unverified footage shared on social media shows what appears to be the rocket breaking up in flames. And footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind. ""Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!"" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky. He also said ""improved versions"" of the ship and booster were ""already waiting for launch"". ""Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,"" Musk said a short while later, adding that ""nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month"". Footage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream. The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission. The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned. But then SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship. The Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware ""an anomaly occurred"" during the SpaceX mission. ""The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,"" it said in a statement. It comes a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying two privately constructed lunar landers and a micro rover to the Moon.

The New Glenn rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 02:02 local time (07:02 GMT). It firmly pits the world's two richest men against each other in a commercial space race, vying to fly bigger and more powerful rockets. Both want to populate the skies with more satellites, run private space stations, and provide transport for regular trips by people to the Moon. ""Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!"" Musk wrote in a post to Bezos on X. Dave Limp, CEO of Bezos's space company Blue Origin, said he was ""incredibly proud"". ""We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring,"" he added. Bezos's team overcame technical barriers that caused delays earlier this week when ice formation halted a launch. Blue Origin's employees and crowds gathered near Cape Canaveral cheered as the 98 meters-high rocket hurtled into orbit. But the company failed to land New Glenn's main rocket engine, or booster, onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean. It had hoped that the booster would be reusable for future launches but after about 20 minutes of flight, the company confirmed it had lost the engine. Bezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business. The New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago. The rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services. That project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service. Blue Origin Media New Glenn is 98 metres high Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted ""millions of people working and living in space."" For years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021. But Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year. And SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today. Starship is even bigger than Blue Origin's New Glenn Some experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations. ""What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,"" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK. Governments have historically spent billions on building rockets and sending missions into space. But US space agency NASA is increasingly moving away from relying only on public money and has issued huge contracts to private companies to provide rockets and other space services.

6d5f7a45f97e,Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?,,"Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts? Jonathan O’Callaghan BBC On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth. This was a landmark moment for humanity – but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all. Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby , the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C. But the success of these autonomous spacecraft – coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence – raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration. NASA Artist's concept of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft approaching the sun Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all. ""Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,"" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. ""I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space."" He also points to the risk to humans. ""The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,"" he argues. Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. ""For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,"" he says. ""[They] go much further and do more things."" NASA US astronaut Buzz Aldrin walking on the surface of the Moon in 1969 They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. ""And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer."" But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts – and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could? Rovers versus mankind Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon. In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket). ""Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,"" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. ""It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant."" But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science. NASA The Earthrise photo was taken by US astronaut William Anders in December 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces. ""Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,"" says Dr Weinersmith. In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: ""A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep… It wants and asks for nothing."" But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical – for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph. ""AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?"" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. ""I just don't think we know."" He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be ""more efficient"". AI assistants and humanoid robots Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research. ""[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,"" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't."" The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. ""We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has"" – meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM. Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans. NASA Nasa's Valkyrie humanoid robot Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities. Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans. Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems. A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly. Reuters Valkyrie demonstrates how it is able to open a bag ""If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,"" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. ""We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around."" He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them. Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input. ""You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,"" says Dr Wagstaff. ""It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep."" NASA Nasa's Perseverance Mars rover takes a ""selfie"" But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot. ""Inspiration is something that is intangible,"" argues Prof Coates. Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. ""Humans relate when humans are doing something. ""The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing."" Life on Mars? Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme. The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface. Reuters Astronauts for NASA's Artemis II mission The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon. Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land . His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years . ""Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,"" explains Dr Weinersmith. ""If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary."" However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved. ""Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,"" she says. ""There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to. ""I think we should be slowing down."" Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. ""I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,"" he says. ""We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars."" Until then, however, humans are likely to continue their small steps into the cosmos, on a path long trodden by robotic explorers before them.

7a8f6f0e1256,New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life,,"New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life Pallab Ghosh Science Correspondent SPL Artwork: Uranus and its five largest moons had been thought to be inactive and sterile. The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought. Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say. Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa’s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago. But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like. Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds – as if it had been knocked over – making it arguably the weirdest. We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons. But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought. The measurements from the spacecraft’s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus’s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun. A planet’s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive. This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system’s other planets and their moons. NASA Miranda, one of the moons of Uranus, photographed by Voyager 2. The new research says the moon possibly has a sub-surface ocean and may even be home to life NASA Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day. The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field. So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London. “These results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!”. NASA The first picture of Uranus was sent back by Voyager 2 in 1986 Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy. “The results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,” she told BBC News. “I’m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It’s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries”. Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as “very exciting”. “It shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions”. Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research. It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years’ time. NASA Plumes of material coming from Enceladus, one of the moons of Saturn, indicating a possible sub-surface ocean. Could the same be true of the Uranian moons? According to Nasa’s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey. “Some of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries”. Nasa’s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36c3/live/d7d05950-9c2a-11ef-a65b-4d3707c63685.jpg,2024-11-11T16:00:05.358000+00:00,a937b3231828496b9bff94e1b83d5fdb9e312e15
66f0921e99f3,Tories pledge to scrap landmark climate legislation,,"The Conservatives have pledged to scrap the UK's landmark climate change legislation and replace it with a strategy for ""cheap and reliable"" energy. The Climate Change Act 2008, which put targets for cutting emissions into law, was introduced by the last Labour government and strengthened under Tory PM Theresa May. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said her party wanted to leave ""a cleaner environment for our children"" but argued ""Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions"". Environmental groups said the move would be an act of ""national self-harm"", while Labour said it would be ""an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations"". Conservative ex-prime minister Baroness Theresa May criticised the decision as a ""retrograde step which upends 17 years of consensus between our main political parties and the scientific community"". ""To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same,"" Baroness May added. The 2008 law, which was passed when current Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the same role in Gordon Brown's government, committed the UK to cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2019, under May's premiership, this legally binding target was updated to reaching net zero by 2050 - meaning the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces. The legislation also established the Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on meeting the target and reports on progress towards reducing emissions. At the time, the law passed through Parliament with the support of all major parties. However, the political consensus on net zero has since fragmented. Badenoch has previously said the target of net zero by 2050 is ""impossible"" for the UK to meet and promised to ""maximise"" extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea . Reform UK has also said it would scrap net zero targets if it wins the next election , blaming the policy for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK. The UK was the first country to establish a long-term legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions, and since the act was passed many other countries have introduced similar legislation. However, the Tories said the act forced ministers ""to make decisions to meet arbitrary climate targets, even if they make the British people poorer, destroy jobs, and make our economy weaker"". The party argues that the 2008 law has ""forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances"". As an example, it pointed to fines for boiler manufacturers who do not hit heat pump sales targets, which critics have branded a ""boiler tax"". The scheme, announced but then delayed by the previous Conservative government, came into force under Labour in April. The UK has high electricity costs, ranking the fourth highest for domestic consumers of medium usage when compared to other EU countries, and the highest for industrial usage. Labour says its plan to boost clean energy in Britain will reduce household energy bills by ""up to £300"" by 2030. However, earlier this year energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family. Badenoch said: ""We want to leave a cleaner environment for our children, but not by bankrupting the country. ""Climate change is real. But Labour's laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions. Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour's climate laws work - they don't. ""Under my leadership we will scrap those failed targets. Our priority now is growth, cheaper energy, and protecting the natural landscapes we all love."" However, Miliband said: ""This desperate policy from Kemi Badenoch if ever implemented would be an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations. ""The Conservatives would now scrap a framework that businesses campaigned for in the first place and has ensured tens of billions of pounds of investment in homegrown British energy since it was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support 17 years ago."" Former Conservative minister Lord Alok Sharma, who was president of the Cop 26 UN climate summit in 2021, said the last Conservative government had a legacy of ""global leadership"" on tackling climate change and urged Badenoch not to ""squander this for the sake of short-term political expediency"". The Liberal Democrats also criticised the announcement. The party's energy security and net zero spokesperson Pippa Heylings said: ""The reality is that investing in renewables is the greatest economic growth opportunity in this century and will protect the planet for future generations."" Meanwhile, Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of environmental groups, said: ""The real route to lasting security is in homegrown clean power, not burning more fossil fuels. ""Without binding climate law, ministers will be free to trade away our future - and it is nature and the poorest communities that will pay the price.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrp2k3m3deo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/752b/live/bb9f6640-9ef4-11f0-b1c8-5d59c9f3a032.jpg,2025-10-02T16:21:23.593000+00:00,3b38645165d96877bb8286fa27d0f09d9add6367
1b42e702a98e,Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities,,"Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor BBC Listen to Justin read this article One morning last year, John Gladwin opened the cupboard under his kitchen sink and discovered a bag of soil he'd been storing there was torn to shreds. Days later he noticed a pungent smell too. It was musty and slightly astringent, not unlike the communal bin area in his block of flats. ""I knew what it was straight away,"" he says. ""Rats."" He'd often seen them scurrying around near bins. Now they were inside his home too. ""I heard them in the cupboards and behind the bath panel. One morning when I woke up they were fighting under the bath, screaming and squealing."" Rodents on the estate in Croydon where John Gladwin lives - a brazen one jumped in a bin bag and pulled out a hunk of food Mr Gladwin, who lives in Croydon with his five children, acted immediately. He put down peppermint oil and rat poison and so far they haven't returned. But the experience shook him. ""I was worried for the children's health, I didn't want them catching anything."" There was another feeling too: shame. ""It's not nice to say we're infested, that our family is living in a rat-infested property."" Cleankill, the pest control company tasked with tackling the infestation on Mr Gladwin's estate, works across the south of England. Its founder, Clive Bury says he has seen a ""remarkable"" increase in call outs for rat activity, estimating a 20% increase in the last two years. Similar patterns are being reported across the country. Trade body the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) says more than half of the pest control companies who are members have seen an increased number of rat callouts over the last five years. Rats live in drains, sewers and burrows, and emerge mostly at night, so counting them is nearly impossible and estimates on rat population figures vary. In the UK it could be anywhere from 10 million to 120 million. What is known is that more than half a million rodent infestations were reported to UK councils, between 2023 and the middle of this year, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by repair company, Drain Detectives. But it's not just affecting the UK. Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto. Though they're not inherently dirty animals, rats scavenge in sewers and bins and can pass on serious diseases to humans. Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) is transmitted through their urine, and hantavirus can be spread by breathing in infected droppings. They can also eat their way through farm produce and contaminate food supplies. So, given rats have shown themselves to be wily in avoiding being caught - what would it really take to stop them? Or are we too far gone to prevent rats from overrunning our cities? Rising temperatures, rising rat activity Bobby Corrigan calls himself an urban rodentologist. He started out as an exterminator in New York City and has spent his life immersed in rats. ""I ended up in sewers, trying to hang poison baits to kill rats."" Years later, while studying rats in college, he went to extreme lengths to understand their behaviours - once he slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe it first hand. What astonished him was their complex social structure, and evidence of what he believed to be signs of altruism. ""I saw young rats carrying food and giving it to older rats that couldn't get around,"" he remembers. He was also determined to understand the reasons for the rise. The number of rats at this block of flats in Croydon is on the rise There are many possible reasons for this. Niall Gallagher, technical manager at the BPCA, says our growing appetite for fast food, the fact some councils collect rubbish less frequently, as well as road and building works disturbing the sewer network, all contribute. But there is evidence that rising temperatures might also be at play. Scientific evidence has found that rat populations are sensitive to temperature but Dr Corrigan, who previously worked at the New York City Department of Health as a research scientist, together with researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia, set out to find out whether the rise in rat activity correlated to temperature increases. Their study examined 16 cities, mostly in North America, and the results, published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year, found that 11 of them recorded significant increases in rat activity over a period of between seven and 17 years. Bobby Corrigan Dr Bobby Corrigan once slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe their behaviour patterns firsthand In Washington DC the increase was almost 400%, in San Francisco it was 300%, Toronto 180% and New York 160%. Only three cities saw declines, including Tokyo and New Orleans. ""Cities experiencing greater temperature increases over time saw larger increases in rats,"" the study found. Those increases approached 2C in some places during the study period. Dr Corrigan believes that - as long as temperatures continue to rise, and in particular winters become warmer - the increase in rat numbers is likely to continue. And global temperatures are indeed set to rise between at least 1.9C and 2.7C above the pre-industrial average by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of independent climate researchers. Phenomenal breeders - until it's cold Rats are phenomenal breeders. A female typically has around six litters a year, each with up to 12 pups. Those rats can start breeding after nine weeks, meaning two rats can potentially create more than 1,000 offspring in a single year. Universal Images Group via Getty Images Rats don't hibernate, so when exposed to the cold, it can kill them  or result in them producing fewer pups, as baby rats are known – which slows population growth Researchers say numbers are particularly prone to increase in cities. That's because their  heat-trapping tarmac and buildings tend to warm more quickly than rural areas. And the trend of people moving from rural areas to cities is playing a part too, according to Dr Corrigan. ""Land is disappearing like crazy, and we're putting up buildings so we reduce their [rats] habitat in the wild,"" he says. Extra buildings means more nooks, pipes and drains for rats to live in. Which all adds to the challenge of how to best control growing populations. A surprising superpower One of the curious facts about rats - and one begins to explain why poison baits often don't work - is that they cannot vomit. In theory this means that once rat poison is ingested, they can't get rid of it. But rats are also ""neophobic"" or fearful of new things, according to Professor Steven Belmain, a professor of ecology at the University of Greenwich. He believes the two points are related. It is something of a ""superpower"", he says, as when they come across a potential food they don't just dive in. ""They will only try a little bit. So once they understand that they don't feel ill, they'll realise, 'okay, I can eat that'. ""You could argue that this cautious approach to life has stood them well."" Getty Images One expert says the solution comes down to focusing on our cities, not rat traps and poison baits Dr Alan Buckle of the University of Reading has spent 30 years working to develop new rat poisons but - he tells me with a laugh - ""I failed"". If a poison tastes bad or causes any discomfort or pain to a rat, they will not eat more. Which is why slower-acting substances, mainly anticoagulants - drugs that stop blood forming into clots - are used. These take up to a week to act, giving enough time for rats to eat a lethal dose. But they are recognised as a cruel way to die, killing the rats by causing internal bleeding. What's more, in recent years rats have developed genetic mutations that give them some immunity to these powerful drugs too. Some researchers are looking at the possibility of using oral contraceptives as an alternative, more humane way to prevent rat numbers growing further. On patrol with the Rat Tsar Few know this challenge better than Kathleen Corradi, a former schoolteacher who was appointed the city's Rat Tsar by the New York Mayor in 2023. An estimated three million rats live in the five boroughs and Corradi was reportedly awarded $3.5m (£2.6m) to increase public awareness about rat mitigation. She started what she calls a ""rat academy"" that teaches people how to stop their neighbourhood from being overrun by rats. New York City Hall Kathleen Corradi was appointed New York's ""Rat Tsar"" to tackle the city's rat problem ""They take a rat walk with me, where we go out into neighbourhoods, and we talk about human behaviour and we talk about rat behaviour,"" she told the BBC earlier this month. ""We talk about how it all comes together and what they could be doing in their neighbourhoods."" Her team also urged New York residents to phone in if they see rats or evidence of behaviours likely to encourage rats. Inspectors investigate the reports and order action, with stiff fines if it isn't taken. And there was another crucial change – instead of putting their rubbish out on the street in plastic bags, now most New Yorkers are obliged to put their waste in rat-proof bins. Getty Images In New York, residents must now use rat-proof bins to keep out rodents - like these Corradi is now leaving the role, but she says the approach is showing some progress. Ultimately, she explained, ""cutting off rats' food source is the key to a sustained reduction"". Overflowing bins and fast food Back in Croydon, Alex Donnovan, a pest controller for Cleankill, leads me into the backyard of the estate where John Gladwin lives. It is just after dawn, and he gestures for me to stay still and keep quiet. Moments later, there is a rustling and a rat darts from beneath the concrete walkway towards the communal bins. Next, the head of a large rat emerges from a burrow at the end of the garden. During the two hours we spent on the estate, some rats climbed high into a tree, while a particularly brazen one jumped into a bin and pulled a hunk of food from a plastic bag while I watched on, less than a metre away. Mr Donnovan believes it is almost impossible to get control of an infestation of this scale. ""There's just so much food."" He gestures to bins overflowing with rubbish bags. ""Even if we put down rodenticide, they won't eat it. They are just not interested… Once these bins are infested with rats, the bin men don't want to collect it either."" John Gladwin, who lives on the estate, says finding rats in his flat made him concerned for his children's health - it also made him feel ashamed Warmer temperatures may well help fuel growing rat populations but our overflowing bins, fondness for fast food and fractured communities all add to the challenge of keeping it under control. In the UK there are more people than ever are living in closer proximity. The Office for National Statistics projects the population will increase from 67.6 million in 2022 to 72.5 million by 2032, with the proportion living in urban areas growing too. So, instead of hoping poison will do the trick, the solution could come down to something far more straightforward. AFP via Getty Images Rats are thriving in cities, fuelled by overflowing bins, fast food and dense urban living ""If we take care of our city environment, then we won't have to worry about being so inhumane to them,"" argues Dr Corrigan. ""By not giving [rats access to] the food and scraps, then we don't have to poison them and kill them and torture them and all the crazy things we do to them."" The challenge now is how to do that, and at speed. After all, as he puts it, we have already ""underestimated them"". ""We ignored rats and let them get out of hand… and now we are paying the price.""

3dd588e836b4,Life on Mars? 'Leopard-spot' rocks could be biggest clue yet,,"Life on Mars? 'Leopard-spot' rocks could be biggest clue yet Rebecca Morelle Science editor NASA/JPL The rocks are covered with unusual markings that look like leopard spots Unusual rocks discovered on Mars contain the most tantalising evidence yet of potential past life on the Red Planet. The mudstones, found in a dusty riverbed by Nasa's Perseverance Rover, are dotted with intriguing markings nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds. Scientists believe these features contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient Martian microbes. It's possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but at a press conference Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found. Watch: NASA finds ""clearest sign"" of ancient life on Mars The findings are significant enough to meet Nasa's criteria for what it calls ""potential biosignatures"". This means that they warrant further investigation to determine whether they are biological in origin. ""We've not had something like this before, so I think that's the big deal,"" said Prof Sanjeev Gupta, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London and one of the authors of a study which has been published in the journal Nature. ""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase."" ""It's like seeing a leftover fossil. Maybe it was a leftover meal, maybe that meal's been excreted and that's what we're seeing here,"" Dr Nicola Fox, Nasa's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, said in at the press conference. The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis . A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain.  The US Space Agency's science budget is facing huge cuts that have been put forward in President Trump's 2026 budget and a sample return mission is one of those facing cancellation. Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. The Perseverance Rover, which touched down on the Martian surface in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology. It has spent the last four years exploring a region called the Jezero Crater, which was once an ancient lake with a river flowing into it. The rover found the leopard print rocks last year at the bottom of a canyon carved out by the river in an area called the Bright Angel Formation. They are about 3.5bn years old and are a type of rock called mudstone, which is fine-grained rock formed from clays. ""We kind of immediately knew there was some interesting chemistry that had happened in these rocks so we were pretty excited right away,"" said Joel Hurowitz from Stony Brook University in New York, who is also a Perseverance mission scientist and lead author of the paper. The rover used several instruments in its onboard lab to analyse the minerals in the rocks. This data was then beamed back to Earth for scientists to study. ""We think what we've found is evidence for a set of chemical reactions that took place in the mud that was deposited at the bottom of a lake - and those chemical reactions seem to have taken place between the mud itself and organic matter - and those two ingredients reacted to form new minerals,"" explained Dr Hurowitz. In similar conditions on Earth, chemical reactions creating minerals are typically driven by microbes. ""That is one of the possible explanations for how these features came to be in these rocks,"" said Dr Hurowitz. ""This feels like the most compelling potential biosignature detection that we've had to date."" The scientists have also examined how the minerals could have formed without microbes - and concluded that natural geological processes could also be behind the chemical reactions. However they would require high temperatures, and the rocks don't look like they've been heated. ""We found some difficulties for the non-biological pathways - but we can't rule them out completely,"" Dr Hurowitz said. NASA/JPL Perseverance has collected samples of the intriguing rocks Perseverance has been collecting samples while it's been exploring Mars - including the rocks found at the Bright Angel Formation.  They have been stored in canisters, and will be deposited on the surface of Mars awaiting a mission that could return them. Nasa's plans for such an endeavour hang in the balance because of the threatened budget cuts, but China is also pursuing a sample return mission that could launch in 2028. While the decision is debated, scientists are desperate to get their gloved hands on the rocks. ""We need to see these samples back on Earth,"" said Prof Gupta. ""I think for true confidence, most scientists would want to see and examine these rocks on Earth - this is one of our high priority samples to return.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd725pj0g9ro,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76f6/live/29389990-8da9-11f0-a306-c7044329a9c6.jpg,2025-09-10T15:00:16.706000+00:00,5e94a5baed2f1f3020c2d3bbe0576f0ae1ac5205

The Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to reach the South Pole more than a century ago. The British party lost the race to the pole, and died on their return journey in 1912. The footage shows the Terra Nova colonised with sea life, but key features of the wooden ship are still visible including its wheel, winch and mast. Getty Images/Royal Geographical Society The Terra Nova is forever entwined in the tragic tale of Captain Scott and his men The wreck lies 170m down off the coast of Greenland. After the polar expedition with Scott, the ship continued in service and eventually sank in 1943 while carrying supplies to US bases during World War Two. The Terra Nova was discovered in 2012 by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, but the new expedition has been the first opportunity to record extensive footage of the wreck. ""To be able to see these significant parts of the wreck, it was truly awe inspiring,"" said Leighton Rolley, Science Systems Manager at REV Ocean. ""The wheel was sat there perfectly intact amongst the debris of the aft section of the wreck. ""When you think of the people who have stood there, manoeuvred the Terra Nova through ice, like Captain Scott… It was like, wow, if that ship's wheel could talk, it could tell an amazing history."" The Terra Nova was one of the finest polar vessels of its time and sailed for 60 years. The ship was 57m (187ft) long with a wooden hull that was a metre thick in places to help it break through the sea ice. Captain Scott's men embarked to Antarctica in 1910. A comprehensive scientific programme was planned for the Terra Nova expedition - along with the goal of being the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, along with Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans, were attempting to make history. After trekking hundreds of miles, the British party reached the pole in January 1912, but they found they had been beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen. Getty Images Captain Scott and his men reached the pole but realised others had got there first A black flag, planted by Amundsen, is now on display at the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge along with other items from the Terra Nova. ""Their hearts must have sunk seeing this black flag against the whiteness of Antarctica,"" said David Waterhouse, curator of the polar museum at SPRI. The deflated British party began their arduous return journey to their base.  But they encountered unusually bad weather, and Edgar Evans died after falling while descending a glacier. Several weeks later Captain Oates left the men's tent. His last words were recorded in Scott's journal: ""I'm just going outside and may be some time."" He was never seen again. Scott, Bowers and Wilson continued on and made a final camp, but trapped by a freezing blizzard with dwindling supplies, all three perished. A search expedition discovered their last camp just 11 miles from a resupply depot that would have provided them with food and fuel. Getty Images The Terra Nova played a crucial role in breaking the news of their death. ""In January 1913, the Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans in the Antarctic to pick up the shore party, and they were expecting to pick up Captain Scott and his pole party at the same time,"" explained Naomi Boneham, an archivist at SPRI. ""But when they arrived they found out the sad news."" The ship's log records that the men had died from ""exposure and want"". The vessel sailed on to New Zealand, where the tragic end of the Terra Nova expedition was announced to the world. Getty Images/SPRI The Terra Nova (pictured in the background) continued in service after the polar expedition finished The new footage from the deep provides another chance to retell Scott's story, says David Waterhouse. ""It's a story that's really got the whole package - the heroism, the tragedy,"" he said. ""And, I guess, as British people, we like an underdog, and they were so close to being the first to the pole and making it back alive."" The ship that witnessed so much history now has a very different existence lying beneath the waves at the other end of the planet. It's not in good condition. While the centre of the ship is relatively intact, there is a lot of damage at the stern and the bow has split into two. But it's become a reef of life, says Leighton Rolley. ""It's full of fish, it's got corals growing on it - it's become one with the ocean.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwyvyqkx9yo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d5a/live/7f161480-790b-11f0-a0a3-2909e79b7d59.jpg,2025-09-02T23:21:27.812000+00:00,b6624250fc670893b94fd193d62fafecc81f6016
04826df30b0c,Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie',,"Oceangate's Titan whistleblower: 'People were sold a lie' Rebecca Morelle Science Editor and Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist David Lochridge David Lochridge was sacked after raising safety concerns When the Titan submersible went missing during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic in 2023, David Lochridge hoped the five people on board – including his former boss - could be rescued. ""I always hoped that what happened wouldn't happen. But I just knew if they kept carrying on the way they were going and with that deficient equipment, then there would be an incident,"" he told the BBC. The whistleblower had been sacked by the firm behind the sub, Oceangate, after warning about safety issues in 2018. In June 2023 the sub imploded killing all five people on board – including Oceangate CEO Stockton Rush. A report from the US Coast Guard (USCG) published on Tuesday found that Oceangate's failures over safety, testing and maintenance were the main cause of the disaster. ""There is so much that could have been done differently. From the initial design, to the build, to the operations - people were sold a lie,"" Lochridge told the BBC. But he firmly believes the US authorities could - and should - have done more to stop Oceangate. PA Media The design and construction of Titan's hull was criticised in the report Lochridge had joined Oceangate seven years earlier as the company's Director of Marine Operations. He moved his family from Scotland to the US, and was full of excitement about the company's ambitions. Oceangate was building a new submersible to take paying passengers down to the most famous wreck in the world - the Titanic. And he was going to be involved in the project from the very start, working alongside the team designing the sub. The straight-talking Glaswegian has worked at sea for more than 25 years, first with the Royal Navy and later as a submersible pilot. He also led submarine rescue operations, responding to distress calls from people trapped underwater. He knows about the risks involved in deep dives. His responsibilities included planning dives and, as chief pilot, he would be the one taking the sub and its passengers 3,800m beneath the waves to see the Titanic. Safety was at the heart of his role. ""As the director of marine operations, I'm the one responsible for everybody,"" he told BBC News. ""I was responsible for the safety of all Oceangate personnel and all of the passengers that were going to be coming in the sub."" Supplied via Reuters / AFP Clockwise from top left: Stockton Rush, Hamish Harding, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet were all killed in the accident A prototype for the new submersible, which would eventually be called Titan, was being developed with the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). The plan was to build its hull - the part where the passengers would sit - out of carbon fibre. No deep diving sub had been made out of this material before - most have hulls constructed from titanium or steel. But Lochridge had confidence in the APL team. He said he was told by Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush that the craft would undergo a safety assessment by an independent marine organisation, known as certification. Lochridge was adamant that this third-party oversight was essential - especially because Titan was to be made of experimental materials. But by the summer of 2016 he was starting to have doubts about the project. Oceangate stopped working with APL and decided to bring the design and construction of Titan in-house. Lochridge was worried. He didn't have the same confidence in Oceangate's engineers. He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic. ""At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,"" he said. As the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem. ""When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,"" he said. He saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination. And he identified issues with other key components. David Lochridge David Lochridge had years of experience at sea The carbon fibre hull had titanium domes fitted on each end, but he said the metal had been machined incorrectly. He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths. Most concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety. He told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent. ""I brought up all the issues that I was seeing… but I was just met with resistance all the way,"" he said. In January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel. Titan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway. Lochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans. ""I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company."" The following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees. A transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush. Towards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: ""I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do."" To Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired. But he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA. OSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety. As part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018. But Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed. In March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined. Then in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal. Lochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate. ""I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks."" he said. ""OSHA did nothing."" 'They beat us down' In December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case. This meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement. ""Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned… We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down."" Oceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic. In 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m. A crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan. In 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck. But in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor. At the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. ""I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented."" ""It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped."" In response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had ""followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case"". OSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety… but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard. The spokesperson said: ""The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels."" But the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention. The report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG. The investigation found that the email from OSHA to the coast guard about Mr Lochridge's complaint was not received. It had been sent to a staff member who had responsibility for monitoring OSHA cases – but the employee had moved on to a new job within the agency. Jason Neubauer,  the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more. ""The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have."" Oceangate said that in the wake of the accident, it had permanently wound down operations and directed its resources towards cooperating with the inquiry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0wpe9479wo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6a63/live/d47e0240-5c12-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg,2025-08-06T05:35:42.501000+00:00,81c5a0423c2c289341117e1f8f83136faf1ec7bd

This is the ambitious £50m plan to renovate the world-famous Palm House, which sits at the heart of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. The hot and humid conditions inside have taken their toll on the building, which opened in 1848 and houses a tropical rainforest. Kew will also use the refurbishment – which will see the glass house closed for five years from 2027 – to reduce emissions from the Palm House to net zero. Kevin Church/BBC News Kew's oldest pot plant will be one of the trickier specimens to relocate The planning permission for the project has now been submitted, and some of the plants that make up the indoor tropical rainforest have started to be relocated. ""This is probably the plant that I worry about moving the most,"" says Thomas Pickering, head of glasshouses. He's standing next to one of Kew's most precious specimens: a plant called Encephalartos altensteinii , which is a type of cycad. It's growing in a pot, and at 250 years old, it's older than the Palm House itself. It's also enormous - weighing more than a tonne and standing about 4m tall. ""It's the sheer size of it. It has a huge weight in that root ball, but also this incredibly long stem, which is very old because they're incredibly slow-growing plants,"" says Pickering. The horticulturists will use scaffolds, supports and braces to protect the plant when the time comes for it to be moved. Other plants, that are a bit easier to shift, have already been taken to a temporary greenhouse. Kevin Church/BBC News The Palm House is packed with plants from all over the world ""It's going to be a long term project,"" explains Pickering. ""And over the next two years, it's going to be a process of selecting which plants we need to containerize (place in pots) and keep, which ones we need to propagate - and also some of the plants will be felled because we won't be able to move them."" RBG Kew The Palm House under construction in the 1840s RBG Kew This is what its interior looked like when it was being built RBG Kew It was completed in 1848 and was an engineering marvel of its time The Palm House was built more than 175 years ago and was a wonder of the Victorian age. No-one had ever constructed a glass house on that scale before and the engineers borrowed techniques from the shipping industry to build the huge structure. It was last renovated in the 1980s, but now the iron is heavily rusting in places, so it will be stripped back to the bare metal work, repaired and repainted. All of the thousands of single glazed panes of glass will be replaced and tests are under way to find the best type of glass to provide maximum insulation. Kevin Church/BBC News Techniques were borrowed from the shipping industry to build the huge structure Kevin Church/BBC News The heat and humidity that help the plants to thrive have damaged it Maintaining the Palm House's temperature at 21C uses a lot of energy,  but now gas boilers will be replaced with air source and water source heat pumps. ""This is an incredibly challenging building to make net zero,"" said Rachel Purdon, head of sustainability at Kew. ""We can do a huge amount with things like sealing the glass and improving the heating systems to massively reduce the carbon footprint and improve the sustainability of the Palm House without impacting the aesthetics.""

82550e7d7a8c,Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it?,,"Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it? Imogen Foulkes Geneva correspondent BBC In a small village in Switzerland's beautiful Loetschental valley, Matthias Bellwald walks down the main street and is greeted every few steps by locals who smile or offer a handshake or friendly word. Mr Bellwald is a mayor, but this isn't his village. Two months ago his home, three miles away in Blatten, was wiped off the map when part of the mountain and glacier collapsed into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days earlier, after geologists warned that the mountain was increasingly unstable. But they lost their homes, their church, their hotels and their farms. Lukas Kalbermatten also lost the hotel that had been in his family for three generations.""The feeling of the village, all the small alleys through the houses, the church, the memories you had when you played there as a child… all this is gone."" Hotel Edelweiss Blatten's residents were evacuated days before the disaster Today, he is living in borrowed accommodation in the village of Wiler. Mr Bellwald has a temporary office there too, where he is supervising the massive clean-up operation - and the rebuild. The good news is, he believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with the first new houses ready by 2029. But it comes with a hefty pricetag. Rebuilding Blatten is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 million (USD) per resident. Voluntary contributions from the public quickly raised millions of Swiss francs to help those who had lost their homes. The federal government and the canton promised financial support too. But some in Switzerland are asking: is it worth it? Shutterstock Houses were destroyed after a large part of Blatten was buried under masses of ice, mud, and rock Though the disaster shocked Switzerland, some two thirds of the country is mountainous, and climate scientists warn that the glaciers and the permafrost – the glue that holds the mountains together – are thawing as the global temperature increases, making landslides more likely. Protecting areas will be costly. Switzerland spends almost $500m a year on protective structures, but a report carried out in 2007 for the Swiss parliament suggested real protection against natural hazards could cost six times that. Is that a worthwhile investment? Or should the country - and residents - really consider the painful option of abandoning some of their villages? The day the earth shook The Alps are an integral part of Swiss identity. Each valley, like the Loetschental, has its own culture. Mr Kalbermatten used to take pride in showing hotel guests the ancient wooden houses in Blatten. Sometimes he taught them a few words of Leetschär, the local dialect. Losing Blatten, and the prospect of losing others like it, has made many Swiss ask themselves how many of those alpine traditions could disappear. Angus MacKenzie 'I'll never forget it. The earth shook.' Fernando Lehner recalls the day of the landslide Today, Blatten lies under millions of cubic metres of rock, mud, and ice. Above it, the mountain remains unstable. When they were first evacuated, Blatten's residents, knowing their houses had stood there for centuries, believed it was a purely precautionary measure. They would be home again soon, they thought. Fernando Lehner, a retired businessman, says no one expected the scale of the disaster. ""We knew there would be a landslide that day… But it was just unbelievable. I would never have imagined that it would come down so quickly. ""And that explosion, when the glacier and landslide came down into the valley, I'll never forget it. The earth shook."" Landslides are 'more unpredictable' The people of Blatten, keen to get their homes back as soon as possible, don't want to talk about climate change. They point out that the Alps are always dangerous, and describe the disaster as a once in a millennium event. But climate scientists say global warming is making alpine life more risky. Matthias Huss, a glaciologist with Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology, as well as glacier monitoring group Glamos, argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster. ""The thawing of permafrost at very high elevation led to the collapse of the summit,"" he explains. Matthias Huss Glaciologist Matthias Huss argues that climate change was a factor in the Blatten disaster ""This mountain summit crashed down onto the glacier… and also the glacier retreat led to the fact that the glacier stabilised the mountain less efficiently than before. So climate change was involved at every angle."" Geological changes unrelated to climate change also played a role, he concedes - but he points out that glaciers and permafrost are key stabilising factors across the alps. His team at Glamos has monitored a record shrinkage of the glaciers over the past few years. And average alpine temperatures are increasing. In the days before the mountain crashed down, Switzerland's zero-degree threshold – the altitude at which the temperature reaches freezing point – rose above 5,000 metres, higher than any mountain in the country. ""It is not the very first time that we're seeing big landslides in the Alps,"" says Mr Huss. ""I think what should be worrying us is that these events are becoming more frequent, but also more unpredictable."" Angus MacKenzie Blatten's residents lost their homes, church and farms: living below a mountain, as many Swiss do, looks increasingly precarious A study from November 2024 by the Swiss Federal Research Institute, which reviewed three decades of literature, concurred that climate change was ""rapidly altering high mountain environments, including changing the frequency, dynamic behavior, location, and magnitude of alpine mass movements"", although quantifying the exact impact of climate change was ""difficult"". More villages, more evacuations Graubünden is the largest holiday region in Switzerland, and is popular with skiers and hikers for its untouched nature, alpine views and pretty villages. The Winter Olympics was hosted here twice - in the upmarket resort of St Moritz - while the town of Davos hosts world leaders for the World Economic Forum each year. One village in Graubünden has a different story to tell. Brienz was evacuated more than two years ago because of signs of dangerous instability in the mountain above. Its residents have still not been able to return, and in July heavy rain across Switzerland led geologists to warn a landslide appeared imminent. Angus MacKenzie Average alpine temperatures are increasing, say scientists. Meanwhile glaciers are shrinking Elsewhere in Switzerland, above the resort of Kandersteg, in the Bernese Oberland region, a rockface has become unstable, threatening the village. Now residents have an evacuation plan. There too, heavy rain this summer raised the alarm, and some hiking trails up to Oeschinen Lake, a popular tourist attraction, were closed. Some disasters have claimed lives. In 2017, a massive rockslide came down close to the village of Bondo, killing eight hikers. Bondo has since been rebuilt, and refortified, at a cost of $64 million. As far back as 2003, the village of Pontresina spent millions on a protective dam to shore up the thawing permafrost in the mountain above. Not every alpine village is at risk, but the apparent unpredictability is causing huge concern. The debate around relocation Blatten, like all Swiss mountain villages, was risk mapped and monitored; that's why its 300 residents were evacuated. Now, questions are being asked about the future of other villages too. In the aftermath of the disaster, there was a huge outpouring of sympathy. But the possible price tag of rebuilding it also came with doubts. An editorial in the influential Neue Zürcher Zeitung questioned Switzerland's traditional - and constitutional - wealth distribution model, which takes tax revenue from urban centres like Zurich to support remote mountain communities. The article described Swiss politicians as being ""caught in an empathy trap"", adding that ""because such incidents are becoming more frequent due to climate change, they are shaking people's willingness to pay for the myth of the Alps, which shapes the nation's identity."" It suggested people living in risky areas of the Alps should consider relocation. Preserving the alpine villages is expensive. And Neue Zürcher Zeitung was not the first to question the cost of saving every alpine community, but its tone angered some. While three quarters of Swiss live in urban areas, many have strong family connections to the mountains. Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration. Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word ""heimat"" is hugely important in Switzerland. ""Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child. ""It's a much bigger word than home."" Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in. For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak Leetschär, the dialect they all still dream in. Imogen Foulkes Traditional wooden masks called Tschäggättä are unique to that valley The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the Tschäggättä, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan. Every February, local young men wear them, along with animal skins, and run through the streets. Mr Kalbermatten points to the example of some areas of northern Italy where this loss of culture has happened. ""[Now] there are only abandoned villages, empty houses, and wolves. ""Do we want that?"" Angus MacKenzie Lukas Kalbermatten believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with Blatten's first new houses ready by 2029. For many, the answer is no: An opinion poll from research institute, Sotomo, asked 2,790 people what they most cherished about their country. The most common answer? Our beautiful alpine landscape, and our stability. But the poll did not ask what price they were prepared to pay. Trying to tame a mountain Boris Previsic, the director of the University of Lucerne's Institute for the Culture of the Alps, says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment. Switzerland's railways, tunnels, cable cars and high alpine passes are masterpieces of engineering, connecting alpine communities. But now, in part because of climate change, he suggests, that confidence is gone. ""The human induced geology is too strong compared to human beings,"" he argues. ""In Switzerland, we thought we could do everything with infrastructure. Now I think we are at ground zero concerning infrastructure."" Boris Previsic Boris Previsic says that many Swiss, at least in the cities, had begun to believe they had tamed the alpine environment The village of Blatten had stood for centuries. ""When you are in a village which has existed already for 800 years, you should feel safe. That is what is so shocking."" In his view, it is time to fight against these villages dying out. ""To fight means we have to be more prepared,"" he explains. ""But we have to be more flexible. We have always also to consider evacuation."" At the end of the day, he adds, ""you cannot hold back the whole mountain"". In the village of Wiler, Mr Previsic's point is greeted with a weary smile. ""The mountain always decides,"" agrees Mr Bellwald. ""We know that they are dangerous. We love the mountains, we don't hate them because of that. Our grandfathers lived with them. Our fathers lived with them. And our children will also live with them."" Angus MacKenzie Helicopters carry debris from the disaster site at Blatten. Even the military is involved in the operation. At lunchtime in the local restaurant in Wiler, the tables are filled with clean-up teams, engineers and helicopter crew. The Blatten recovery operation is in full swing. At one table, a man from one of Switzerland's biggest insurance companies sits alone. Every half hour, he is joined by someone, an elderly couple, a middle aged man, a young woman. He buys each a drink, and carefully notes down the details of their lost homes. Outside, along the valley's winding roads, lorries and bulldozers trundle up to the disaster site. Overhead, helicopters carry large chunks of debris. Even the military is involved. Sebastian Neuhaus commands the Swiss army's disaster relief readiness battalion, and says they must press on despite the scale of the task. ""We have to,"" he says. ""There are 300 life histories buried down there."" The abiding feeling is one of stubborn determination to carry on. ""If we see someone from Blatten, we hug each other,"" says Mr Kalbermatten. ""Sometimes we say, 'it's nice, you're still here.' And that's the most important thing, we are all still here."" Lead image: The village of Blatten after the disaster.

c57d453b9995,Why plane turbulence is becoming more frequent - and more severe,,"Why plane turbulence is becoming more frequent - and more severe Simon King Lead Weather Presenter BBC Listen to this article being read Andrew Davies was on his way to New Zealand to work on a Doctor Who exhibition, for which he was project manager. The first leg of his flight from London to Singapore was fairly smooth. Then suddenly the plane hit severe turbulence. ""Being on a rollercoaster is the only way I can describe it,"" he recalls. ""After being pushed into my seat really hard, we suddenly dropped. My iPad hit me in the head, coffee went all over me. There was devastation in the cabin with people and debris everywhere. ""People were crying and [there was] just disbelief about what had happened."" Mr Davies was, he says, ""one of the lucky ones"". Other passengers were left with gashes and broken bones. Geoff Kitchen, who was 73, died of a heart attack. Death as a consequence of turbulence is extremely rare. There are no official figures but there are estimated to have been roughly four deaths since 1981. Injuries, however, tell a different story. REUTERS/Stringer Severe turbulence on the Singapore Airlines flight caused the plane to drop 178ft (54m) in 4.6 seconds In the US alone, there have been 207 severe injuries - where an individual has been admitted to hospital for more than 48 hours - since 2009, official figures from the National Transportation Safety Board show. (Of these, 166 were crew and may not have been seated.) But as climate change shifts atmospheric conditions, experts warn that air travel could become bumpier: temperature changes and shifting wind patterns in the upper atmosphere are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe turbulence. ""We can expect a doubling or tripling in the amount of severe turbulence around the world in the next few decades,"" says Professor Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading. ""For every 10 minutes of severe turbulence experienced now, that could increase to 20 or 30 minutes."" So, if turbulence does get more intense, could it become more dangerous too - or are there clever ways that airlines can better ""turbulence-proof"" their planes? The bumpy North Atlantic route Severe turbulence is defined as when the up and down movements of a plane going through disturbed air exert more than 1.5g-force on your body - enough to lift you out of your seat if you weren't wearing a seatbelt. Estimates show that there are around 5,000 incidents of severe-or-greater turbulence every year, out of a total of more than 35 million flights that now take off globally. Of the severe injuries caused to passengers flying throughout 2023 - almost 40% were caused by turbulence, according to the annual safety report by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The route between the UK and the US, Canada and the Caribbean is among the areas known to have been affected. Over the past 40 years, since satellites began observing the atmosphere, there has been a 55% increase in severe turbulence over the North Atlantic. But the frequency of turbulence is projected to increase in other areas too according to a recent study - among them, parts of East Asia, North Africa, North Pacific, North America and the Middle East. The knock-on effect of climate change There are three main causes of turbulence: convective (clouds or thunderstorms), orographic (air flow around mountainous areas) and clear-air (changes in wind direction or speed). Each type could bring severe turbulence. Convective and orographic are often more avoidable - it is the clear-air turbulence that, as the name might imply, cannot be seen. Sometimes it seemingly comes out of nowhere. KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV /AFP via Getty Avoiding turbulence-producing storms can crowd airspace, as more planes are forced to change routes, according to experts Climate change is a major factor in driving up both convective and clear-air turbulence. While the relationship between climate change and thunderstorms is complex, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture - and that extra heat and moisture combine to make more intense thunderstorms. Linking this back to turbulence — convective turbulence is created by the physical process of air rising and falling in the atmosphere, specifically within clouds. And you won't find more violent up and downdrafts than in cumulonimbus, or thunderstorm clouds. This was the cause of the severe turbulence on Andrew Davies's journey back in 2024. A report by Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau found that the plane was ""likely flying over an area of developing convective activity"" over south Myanmar, leading to ""19 seconds of extreme turbulence that included a drop of 178 feet in just under five seconds"". MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images A 2014 US study found that for every 1°C rise in global temperature, lightning strikes increase by 12% One study from the US published in the Science journal in 2014 showed that for 1C increase in global temperature, lightning strikes increase by 12%. Captain Nathan Davies, a commercial airline pilot, says: ""I have noticed more large storm cells spreading 80 miles plus in diameter in the last few years, something you'd expect to be rare."" But he adds: ""The large cumulonimbus clouds are easy to spot visually unless embedded within other clouds, so we can go around them."" Clear-air turbulence could also soon rise. It is caused by disturbed air in and around the jet stream, (a fast-moving wind at around six miles in the atmosphere, which is the same height as where planes cruise). Wind speeds in the jet stream travelling from west to east across the Atlantic can vary from 160mph to 250mph. There is colder air to the north and warmer air to the south: this temperature difference and change in winds is useful for airliners to use as a tailwind to save time and fuel. But it also creates the turbulent air. ""Climate change is warming the air to the south of the jet stream more than the air to the north so that temperature difference is being made stronger,"" explains Prof Williams. ""Which in turn is driving a stronger jet stream."" 'It should worry us all' The increase in severe turbulence - enough to lift you out of your seat - could potentially bring more incidents of injury, or possibly death in the most severe cases. And some passengers are concerned. For Mr Davies, the prospect of more turbulence is worrying. ""A lot. Not just for me, but my children too,"" he explains. ""I'm pleased there hasn't been an incident as severe as mine but I think it should worry us all"". More than a fifth of UK adults say they are scared of flying, according to a recent YouGov survey, and worsening turbulence could make journeys even more of a nightmare for these people. As Wendy Barker, a nervous flyer from Norfolk, told me: ""More turbulence to me equals more chance of something going wrong and less chance of survival."" Aircraft wings are, however, designed to fly through turbulent air. As Chris Keane, a former pilot and now ground-school instructor says, ""you won't believe how flexible a wing is. In a 747 passenger aircraft, under 'destructive' testing, the wings are bent upwards by some 25 degrees before they snap, which is really extreme and something that will never happen, even in the most severe turbulence."" For airlines, however, there is a hidden concern: that is the economic costs of more turbulence. The hidden cost of turbulence AVTECH, a tech company that monitors climate and temperature changes - and works with the Met Office to help warn pilots of turbulence - suggests that the costs can range from £180,000 to £1.5 million per airline annually. This includes the costs of having to check and maintain aircraft after severe turbulence, compensation costs if a flight has to be diverted or delayed, and costs associated with being in the wrong location. Kevin Carter/GETTY Climate change is one factor in making turbulence worse, increasing both storm-related and clear-air turbulence Eurocontrol, a civil-military organisation that helps European aviation understand climate change risks, says that diverting around turbulence-producing storms can have a wider impact - for example, if lots of aircraft are having to change flight paths, airspace can get more crowded in certain areas. ""[This] increases workload for pilots and air traffic controllers considerably,"" says a Eurocontrol spokesperson. Having to fly around storms also means extra fuel and time. In 2019 for example, Eurocontrol says bad weather ""forced airlines to fly one million extra kilometres, producing 19,000 extra tonnes of CO2."" With extreme weather predicted to increase, they expect flights will need to divert around bad weather such as storms and turbulence even more by 2050. ""Further driving up the costs to airlines, passengers and [increasing] their carbon footprint."" How airlines are turbulence-proofing Forecasting turbulence has got better in recent years and while it is not perfect, Prof Williams suggests we can correctly forecast about 75% of clear-air turbulence. ""Twenty years ago it was more like 60% so thanks to better research that figure is going up and up over time,"" he says. Aircraft have weather radar that will pick up storms ahead. As Capt Davies explains, ""Before a flight, most airlines will produce a flight plan that details areas of turbulence likely throughout the route, based on computer modelling."" It is not 100% accurate, but ""it gives a very good idea combined with other aircraft and Air Traffic Control reports once we are en-route"". RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock An Austrian start-up, Turbulence Solutions, says it has developed turbulence-cancelling tech for light aircraft Southwest Airlines in the US recently decided to end cabin service earlier, at 18,000ft instead of the previous 10,000ft. By having the crew and passengers seated with belts on ready for landing at this altitude, Southwest Airlines suggests it will cut turbulence-related injuries by 20%. Also last year, Korean Airlines decided to stop serving noodles to its economy passengers as it had reported a doubling of turbulence since 2019, which raised the risk of passengers getting burned. From owls to AI: extreme measures Some studies have taken turbulence-proofing even further, and looked at alternative ways to build wings. Veterinarians and engineers have studied how a barn owl flies so smoothly in gusty winds, and discovered wings act like a suspension and stabilise the head and torso when flying through disturbed air. The study published in the Royal Society proceedings in 2020 concluded that ""a suitably tuned, hinged-wing design could also be useful in small-scale aircraft…helping reject gusts and turbulence"". Separately, a start-up in Austria called Turbulence Solutions claims to have created turbulence cancelling technology for light aircraft, where a sensor detects turbulent air and sends a signal to a flap on the wing which counteracts that turbulence. These can reduce moderate turbulence by 80% in light aircraft, according to the company's CEO. NurPhoto via Getty Turbulence forecasting has improved in recent years, helping pilots avoid bumpy areas Then there are those arguing that AI could be a solution. Fourier Adaptive Learning and Control (FALCON) is a type of technology being researched at the California Institute of Technology that learns how turbulent air flows across a wing in real-time. It also anticipates the turbulence, giving commands to a flap on the wing which then adjusts to counteract it. However Finlay Asher, an aerospace engineer and member of Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers calling for a more sustainable future in aviation, explained that these types of technology are some time away. ""[They're] unlikely to appear on large commercial aircraft within the next couple of decades."" But even if turbulence does become more frequent, and more severe, experts argue this isn't cause for worry. ""It's generally nothing more than annoying,"" says Captain Davies. But it might mean more time sitting down, with the seat-belt fastened. Andrew Davies has already learnt this the hard way: ""I do get a lot more nervous and don't look forward to flying like I used to,"" he admits. ""But I won't let it define me. ""The moment I sit down, my seat belt goes on and if I do need to get up, I pick my moment - then I'm quickly back in my seat, buckled up again.""

4001cd116eb4,The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern,,"The fate of the Sycamore Gap tree has shed light on a deeper concern Helen Briggs Environment correspondent BBC James Canton spent two years sitting beneath an 800-year-old oak tree near his home in Essex, watching acorns fatten and butterflies land on the massive knurled grey trunk. Sometimes he sat in the branches too. Canton, a lecturer at the University of Essex, recalls how it helped him feel a ""sense of connection"". ""We're happier sat in an oak tree ten foot from the ground, watching blue tits feeding on caterpillars – involved and immersed in that natural world."" He went on to write a book called The Oak Papers about that time spent studying the Honywood Oak. For years, it was easy to forget that we used to be a woodland nation: around 6,000 years ago untouched swathes of oak, hazel, birch and pine blanketed an estimated 75% of the UK. But in recent months the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland has put our relationship with trees, and the natural world more widely, back under the spotlight. PA Media The Sycamore Gap tree stood in a natural dip along Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland for over a century before it was felled in 2023 Two men are due to be sentenced today for the crime that has been called a ""mindless destruction"". Canton calls it a ""symbolic"" moment. The felling of the Sycamore Gap has prompted calls for stricter legal protections for trees, not only to help prevent similar crimes in future but also to help the public appreciate the value of trees at a time when many of our woodlands are in poor health and targets for tree-planting are not being met. But even if the government were to back calls for greater legal protections, other questions remain - namely, which trees should be protected? And arguably even more pressingly: should Britain be thinking more broadly about how to save our depleting woodlands - and is legal protection enough or is a fundamental rethink required? UK's 'odd relationship' with trees The Sycamore Gap wasn't a particularly ancient tree, nor a native species, but its position gave it a totemic status. Tucked into a fold of the hills in an area of outstanding beauty, it was famous around the world. People went there to have picnics, propose marriage, scatter ashes and to seek solace during lockdown. Local people spoke of their devastation at its loss, while Northumberland National Park Authority received thousands of emails, letters and messages. Northumbria Police Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were both found guilty of two counts of criminal damage in connection with the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree And yet despite apparently being a nation of tree lovers, the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth - it still isn’t planting enough trees, despite calls by successive governments. The UK has 13% woodland cover, compared to an average of 38% in Europe, according to Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University. Despite woodland creation rates being much higher now than they were in the 2010s, they remain off track, according to statistics from Forest Research. The target set by the previous Conservative government was to plant 30,000 hectares a year by 2025 across the UK, in line with the heyday of tree planting in the 1970s. Statistics show that 20,700 hectares of new woodland was created in the UK between April 2023 and March 2024, a big achievement. However, this fell to 15,700 hectares over the year to March 2025, largely as a result of a drop-off in planting in Scotland. (Rates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland went up – though from a low base.) Mike Kemp via Getty Images Experts warn that the UK's native woodlands are in crisis, with only 7% currently in good ecological condition And the woodlands that already exist aren't in great shape. Only 7% of it is in good ecological health, says Prof Gagen. She is among those who think that this all nods to an ""odd relationship"" with trees – one of ""simultaneously adoring and denuding woodlands"". Andrew Allen of the Woodland Trust warns there could be a knock-on effect: ""While money goes into getting new trees in the ground, we continue to spend very little on looking after the trees we already have - and this risks serious consequences."" 'Why would a tree older than Stonehenge go unprotected?'' Ancient trees provide a home to hundreds of different bird, insect and mammal species, yet they have no automatic right of protection. This is unlike some other countries, including Italy and Poland, where so-called ""heritage"" trees have specific legal protections. Some UK trees are protected through being in a nature reserve or a site of special scientific interest, while Tree Preservation Orders can be made by a local planning authority to protect specific trees or woodland from deliberate damage or destruction. PA Media The Tree Council has published a report urging stronger protection for the country's most significant and irreplaceable trees, like the one at Sycamore Gap Yet many fall through the gaps. Only a fifth of our ""oldest and most important veteran trees"" are in protected areas, says Prof Gagen. Veteran trees are trees that through their own decay act as a habitat for other species, promoting biodiversity. The Tree Council charity has written a report calling for greater protections for the country's ""most important trees"", such as the one that stood at the Sycamore Gap. The outpouring of emotion and anger after the felling shows how valued these ""socially, culturally and environmentally important trees are"", says Jess Allan, science and research projects manager at the charity. On the back of a Heritage Trees Bill, introduced in December 2023 as a private members bill in the House of Lords, the charity is calling for legislation to create a statutory list of the most valuable trees and to impose stricter penalties for damaging them, mirroring the system for listed buildings. Crucially, this could protect trees that are much-loved and culturally important because of their place in the landscape, as well as protecting ancient trees that are vital in preserving nature. PA Media Backed by the proposed Heritage Trees Bill in the House of Lords, the Tree Council is calling for a legal register of the UK's most valuable trees, along with tougher penalties for damaging them Jon Stokes, the charity's director of trees, science and research, points out that in Portugal, the fine for destroying a notable tree can be as much as €500,000 (£433,000). He says protecting our ""most celebrated trees"" is a no-brainer. ""There are yew trees in this country that are older than Stonehenge – nobody would ever contemplate not protecting Stonehenge so why would a living thing that's older than Stonehenge not receive some protection?"" He hopes something positive could come out of the felling of the Sycamore Gap: it has made people realise that some of the UK's trees are ""truly vital to our culture and heritage and history – and our biodiversity - we should be looking after them better than we are at the moment"". The Tree Council's report is currently being assessed by the government, but there is no date on when any decision will be made. 'You can't stop reckless acts' There are some who believe legal reforms are not enough. After all, the proposed new measures might not have saved the famous sycamore: its felling involved trespass onto land owned by the Northumberland National Park. A Tree Preservation Order wouldn't have made a difference either, adds Sarah Dodd of Tree Law in Barry, Wales, a law firm that specialises in legal issues involving trees. ""Ultimately, you can put all the protection you want on trees, but some people are just going to break the law. You can't stop some people doing some reckless acts.” PA Media At the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, Dame Judi Dench was presented with a seedling from the Sycamore Gap tree The bigger question, she says, is how we get people to appreciate the value of trees and therefore not want to fell them. She hopes that giving trees special legal status will raise their profile, and make people recognise their importance. Mr Stokes, of the Tree Council, says that to maximise the biodiversity value of trees, it’s crucial to celebrate and protect the old ones. And to build up new trees next to older ones, so that wildlife can flow ""from these ancient bastions into the new woods and hedges and individual trees that we're planting"". A recent report by the Woodland Trust confirmed that the current health of woods and trees is ""concerning"". Proposed solutions include more woodland creation, better management, agroforestry (combining agriculture and trees), ancient woodland restoration, and natural flood management, whereby trees are planted to slow down water flow. But this will not be easy and Prof Gagen of Swansea University says saving the UK's woodlands is a complex problem that demands difficult choices. Difficult choices ahead ”Unfortunately, for most people if asked if they'd like more new, cheaper housing or faster transport, or to protect nature, they are going to sacrifice a woodland,"" says Prof Gagen. She argues there is a need to ensure people are aware of the ""true value of nature"". ""A single big tree in the right place is providing thousands of pounds worth of carbon store, flood protection, free air conditioning, habitat, wellbeing provision, pollution control and a hundred other benefits, and no one is asked to pay those costs if the tree is felled for development. “That needs to change to save UK woodlands."" As for Canton, he stills visits the Honywood Oak near his home, and is involved in projects to turn around the fortunes of the ""forgotten forests"", areas of ancient woodland that were historically turned into timber plantations and now need to be restored. He hopes that years from now we will have learned from the loss of the Sycamore Gap tree and others like it, and changed our attitude. ""I'd really like to think that in a generation's time, there will be rights for trees – trees that are over say 100 years old that you cannot do this, and you get much worse punishments than currently exist,"" he says. ""Hopefully in time we will gradually get there – our society is naturally catching up with our natural emotional connection with the natural world.""

323e4673cd37,This burger was made from cow cells in a lab. Should it really be served in restaurants?,,"This burger was made from cow cells in a lab. Should it really be served in restaurants? Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent BBC Inside an anonymous building in Oxford, Riley Jackson is frying a steak. The perfectly red fillet cut sizzles in the pan, its juices releasing a meaty aroma. But this is no ordinary steak. It was grown in the lab next door. What's strangest of all is just how real it looks. The texture, when cut, is indistinguishable from the real thing. ""That's our goal,"" says Ms Jackson of Ivy Farm Technologies, the food tech start-up that created it. ""We want it to be as close to a normal steak as possible."" Lab-grown meat is already sold in many parts of the world and in a couple of years, pending being granted regulatory approval, it could also be sold in the UK too - in burgers, pies and sausages. Unlike so-called vegetarian meat, which is already available in UK supermarkets -  from fake bacon rashers made from pea protein to steaks made of soy, and dyed bright red to resemble the real thing - lab-grown meat is biologically real meat, grown from cow cells. Ivy Farm Technologies The lab-grown steak from Ivy Farm Technologies has a texture indistinguishable from regular steak To some, this could be a smart technological fix for a growing environmental problem: the rise in planet-heating gases caused, in part, by the rapid and growing demand for meat. But others argue that the environmental benefits of lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, have been oversold. Some critics say that more effort should instead be expended on reducing meat consumption, instead of looking to a technology fix. Then there are questions around the ultra-processed nature of this meat, which some also worry will be produced by a handful of multinational companies. So now, with dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats having already gone on sale in the UK earlier this year and with the possibility of lab-grown food for humans becoming available sooner than expected - the debate has never been more prescient. Nor has the question: to grow or not to grow? Curbing greenhouse gas emissions Global demand for meat is growing. According the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, meat production has increased fivefold since the 1960s and reached around 364 million tonnes in 2023. Producing 1kg of beef can generate planet-heating greenhouse gases, equivalent to roughly 40kg of carbon dioxide, though estimates can vary depending on the type of production. A study published in Nature Food in 2021 concluded that food production was responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle also burp planet-heating methane gas, plus they require water and land. Ivy Farm Technologies The BBC's Pallab Ghosh witnessed Ivy Farm's lab-grown steak being cooked but was unable to sample it as it is not yet approved Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City St George's, University of London argues that the issue is a ticking environmental time bomb. ""The situation is absolutely dire,"" he says. ""Politicians are fearful of engaging with the issue. They don't want to take on the meat and farming industry, nor do they wish to risk unpopularity by enacting policies that would reduce meat consumption."" Lab-grown meat has been marketed as part of a solution. Its advocates claim that it can meet the growing demand for meat with much less carbon emissions and land use, plus it can help governments hit certain targets. In the UK, for example, a 2021 independent review for the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has called for a 30% reduction in meat consumption by 2032 to meet the country's net zero target. Lab-grown sausages, eel and caviar The science behind lab-grown meat is also relatively straightforward. Researchers take cells from a farm animal and grow more of them in a dish. When they have enough, they are put into ever larger vats until they have enough to produce a meat product. Turning this into something that people want to eat is trickier. Each company has its own closely guarded secret sauce. But in the main, the cells are developed in a cocktail of nutrients, which encourage them to grow in the right way, after which other ingredients are sometimes added to boost the nutritional values. The result is a paste, which is then processed and mixed with other foods such as soy to make it look, feel and taste more like meat. There are also plans to produce fish-like products this way, including eel and even caviar. Good Meat, Inc. The laboratory at GOOD Meat - its cultivated chicken is approved for sale in Singapore and the United States Ivy Farm Technologies business that has applied for approval to sell its cultivated meat in the UK. If granted, its first products won't be steaks but burgers and sausages. It plans to combine cultivated mince, (which is cheaper and easier to produce than trying to replicate the taste of a real steak) with regular mince to create a blended cow-cultivated beef burger. ""If you want to make a sustainable difference, you have to go for mass production and burgers are where the masses are,"" says the firm's CEO Dr Harsh Amin. ""If you blend our cultivated meat with animal derived meat, you are [still] reducing the carbon footprint."" ""Hope not hard evidence""? Ivy Farm claims this type of meat can lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental benefits. Other companies make similar claims, but these are based more on hope than hard evidence, according to Dr John Lynch, of Oxford University, who has carried out a comprehensive, independent assessment of the climate impact of lab-grown meat. ""There have not been any accurate climate assessment studies because production is not happening at large scale at the moment,"" he adds. The problem with comparing the climate impact of lab-grown meat with agricultural production is that there is little data and many variables. Growing cells in vats requires energy, as does producing the chemicals that are added. Businesses keep the details of their processes secret, for perfectly legitimate reasons, so it is hard to produce a single figure for the climate cost of cultivated meat. Farm Images via Getty Methane from cows disappears from the atmosphere after about 12 years but the CO2 used to produce lab-grown food may stay around for longer Dr Lynch has assessed the data available in scientific papers and found that the best-case cultivated meat carbon footprints were as low as 1.65 kg of CO2 per kg, which is better for the climate than traditional beef production. However, if a lab-grown meat process needs a lot of energy, some estimates put the figure as high as 22kg of CO2 per kg, making its climate advantage less certain. Then there is the fact that the cows' methane gas burps disappear from the atmosphere after 12 years or so, whereas the CO2 produced to grow the lab meat continues to do its damage for much longer. Dr John Lynch has taken the more damaging impact of methane into account in his calculations and they indicate that the persistance of CO2 in the atmosphere can do more damage in the long term. So, in the long run, it may be a bad idea to replace cows with high energy lab-grown production, according to Dr Lynch's assessment. Yet that may be counter-balanced by the fact that cultivated meat production would require far less land. The bottom line is that the environmental advantages of lab-grown beef over cattle farming is a closer run thing than its advocates argue - but it is likely to have the edge as production methods scale up and become more efficient, according to Dr Lynch. ""For beef, it is quite viable for cultured meat to come out on top,"" he argues. ""But I don't think it is the same story for chicken and pork, which convert their feed into meat more efficiently than cattle."" Lab-grown salmon in fine dining restaurants Singapore became the first country to allow the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption in 2020. This was followed by the United States three years later and Israel in 2024. UK firms have complained that the regulatory approvals process is too slow for them to keep up with overseas competitors. But sales in those countries have in the main been peripatetic, with many firms only offering tastings or serving it in upmarket restaurants for short periods. Good Meat, Inc. Good Meat's lab-grown chicken was served at a restaurant in Washington, DC This is largely because manufacturers are not able to mass-produce their products in sufficient quantities or as cheaply as traditional meat. In the US, four companies have received some form of regulatory approval for their lab-grown chicken, pork fat and salmon. Salmon from Wildtype, for example, is now served at Kann, a fine-dining restaurant in Oregon, while Good Meat's chicken was introduced at a restaurant in Washington, DC. The response from consumers so far has been ""optimistic and curious"", according to Suzi Gerber who is the executive director of the US Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation. What farmers and fishermen say Some parts of the US cattle industry have, however, expressed opposition to the technology and lobbied for it to be banned, though other livestock firms have remained neutral or been supportive. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and several state-level organisations publicly oppose bans, perhaps in case it sets a precedent for banning other scientific advances, such as bio-engineered food stock for cattle. The cultivated meat industry says that their products should have no effect on the livestock industry – people will always prefer real meat over artificial. The role of the new technology is, they say, to meet the demand that livestock production is unable to. The seafood industry has also shown openness: for example, the US National Fisheries Institute recognises cultivated seafood as part of a broader domestic production of on-land fish, like aquaculture. Will ""high-protein slurry"" really save the planet? Ellen Dinsmoor is chief operating officer of Vow, a Sydney-based firm that sells cultivated Japanese quail products in Singapore. It recently received approval to sell in Australia too. Unlike some cultivated meat firms, Vow is not trying to copy normal meats. Instead, the firm has chosen quail because fewer people know what it is supposed to taste like. ""What we have to do is produce a really delicious product that people want,"" she explains. ""A little later we can sell it on nutrition, for example we can add healthy omega-3 oils found only in salmon into chicken. And then if we can do all that at a fraction of the price, this is where it becomes interesting to consumers."" This is all part of a strategy to create a stable high-end market, which could in time enable investment in producing food that is less posh and in larger quantities. But for some critics, the potential benefits of this technology for the environment, or indeed for the poorest communities in the world, are being lost. Vow Unlike other lab-grown meat companies, Vow isn't trying to copy traditional meats - its products include Vow Japanese Quail Foie Gras and Japanese Quail Whipped Pate Some of the start-up companies involved are driven by delivering swift returns to their investors, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken, author of Ultra-Processed People, which can be more easily done by producing high-priced products in high-income countries. A simpler, cheaper and easier option, he argues, would be to persuade people in both developed and emerging countries to eat less meat. ""It is all very well to propose to people that they should eat a high-protein slurry to keep themselves well,"" he argues, ""but… I don't think it is something we should impose on already marginalised groups of people."" He also worries that the emergence of cultivated food is an acceleration of a long-term trend away from environmentally sustainable, locally sourced, whole foods and toward factory mass-produced fare. ""And at the moment the process is pretty energy intensive."" But like it or not, lab-grown meat is here. To some, it's a healthier option with less cholesterol, no animal suffering - and a clever solution to a pressing environmental problem. To others, those benefits may have been overblown. For all the promises and potential about helping the world, however, most people choose food for more personal reasons, namely how it tastes and how affordable it is. That, more than anything, may well decide its future.

217450c7542d,William visibly moved as widow tells of husband's suicide,,"William visibly moved as widow tells of husband's suicide Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Watch: Prince William was visibly moved as he heard first hand about the devastating impact of suicide, having to pause during a conversation The Prince of Wales was visibly moved as he heard first hand about the devastating impact of suicide, having to pause during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, whose husband took his own life. Rhian has since set up a bereavement charity - and Prince William's Royal Foundation is contributing £1m to develop a National Suicide Prevention Network. The network, which will operate across the UK, will work to understand more about the root causes of suicide and to offer support for those affected. Prince William, on World Mental Health Day, said he wanted to ""build a bold, unified national response to the heartbreaking and preventable tragedy of suicide"". KENSINGTON PALACE Prince William visited Rhian Mannings at her home in Cardiff In an emotional conversation, captured on camera, Rhian Mannings told the prince that her husband had taken his own life, five days after the couple had faced the death of their one-year-old son. The prince asked her how she had coped and continued to bring up two children. ""I look back and I still don't know how we survived it,"" said Rhian. ""Unfortunately, there's still a lot of stigma around suicide, did you feel that at the time?"" asked Prince William. ""I was quite surprised by it. I'd never been touched by suicide. It was something that happened on the news. No one would talk about it,"" he was told by Rhian, in a conversation in her kitchen in Cardiff. Prince William asked her what she would say to her husband. ""'Why didn't you speak to me?' I ask myself that every single day. He was absolutely devastated, he did keep blaming himself,"" she said. ""But I would just like to sit him down like this and say 'Why didn't you come to me?' Because he's missed out on just so much joy. And we would have been ok. I think that's the hardest thing, we would have been ok."" The prince seemed too upset to speak. ""Are you ok?"" she asked. ""I'm sorry, it's hard to ask you the questions,"" said William. ""You've experienced loss yourself,"" said Rhian. ""Life can throw you these awful curve balls. By talking about it, by having hope, you can continue."" After her own terrible loss, which happened in 2012, Rhian founded a charity, 2wish, to help those affected by the sudden or unexpected death of a child or young person. That charity will be one of 20 organisations that will form part of a new National Suicide Prevention Network, being launched with £1m over three years, from the Royal Foundation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The network will be chaired by Professor Ann John, an expert in the prevention of suicide and consultant in public health medicine in Wales. The Royal Foundation says that preventing suicide is a ""complex challenge"" and there is no ""one size fits all model of support"". But the new network will try to understand more about the causes of suicide, to provide support that can be accessed by anyone and to encourage more collaboration between different agencies and charities. Reuters Prince William last month visited the Jac Lewis Foundation in Cardiff Among the charities in the network will be the Jac Lewis Foundation in Cardiff, which Prince William visited last month. It provides a drop-in centre, located inside Cardiff's Principality Stadium, which can provide mental health support to the local community. The charity's chief executive officer, Elizabeth Thomas-Evans, said: ""From the valleys to the cities, suicide has scarred communities across Wales."" But she hoped that people in need would now be able to walk in and get help. Another partner is James' Place, which offers free support to men in suicidal crisis in Liverpool, London and Newcastle. Chief executive Ellen O'Donoghue said she wanted to ""remove some of the barriers men face in accessing support at the point of crisis"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ej877g7w1o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/572e/live/8de9a860-a5a6-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-10T06:48:16.182000+00:00,332c5fdb7f3f5cb7417db8e864ef255107810ba1
b959f604a52e,Want to feel calmer? How 20 minutes outside will help,,"Want to feel calmer? How 20 minutes outside will help Getty Images Spending just 20 minutes in nature can trigger measurable changes inside your body If you've ever felt calmer after a walk in the park or a stroll through the woods, it's not your imagination - it's biology. Being outdoors can trigger measurable changes inside your body from lowering stress hormones, easing blood pressure and even improving your gut health. You don't have to hike for hours to feel these benefits as maximum impact happens after just 20 minutes, so even a lunchtime walk to the park and a sandwich on a bench a few times a week can benefit your body and mind. Here are four ways that being among nature can help improve your health. Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves. Listen to What's Up Docs? on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your BBC podcasts."" 1. You unconsciously relax When you see green trees, smell pine and hear gentle rustling leaves or the sound of birdsong, your autonomic nervous system - a network of nerves controlling unconscious processes - responds instantly. This can happen on a visit to the local park. ""We see changes in the body such as a lowering of blood pressure, a change in your heart rate variability and  your heart beats slower - all associated with physiological calming,"" Baroness Kathy Willis, a biodiversity professor at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's What's Up Docs? podcast . A UK study , involving nearly 20,000 people, found that those who spent at least a total of 120 minutes every week in greenery were significantly more likely to report good health and higher psychological well-being. The evidence for the benefits of spending time in nature is compelling enough that some areas have trialled so called green social prescribing connecting people with nature to improve their phsyical and mental health, with a positive impact on happiness and wellbeing . 2. Your hormones reboot Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. Willis says that spending time outdoors triggers our endocrine system and lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. ""A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a large increase in natural killer cells in their blood."" Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body. The participants in the study still had elevated natural killer cells in their body two weeks after inhaling the smell. Essentially nature ""calms what needs calming and strengthens what needs strengthening,"" is how Prof Ming Kuo from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, summed it up to the BBC . ""A three-day weekend in nature has a huge impact on our virus fighting apparatus and even a month later it can be 24% above baseline."" Studies also show smaller but still persistent effects from shorter periods spent in nature, she says. 3. Smell is a powerful sense Smelling nature is just as powerful as seeing and hearing it. The scent of trees and soil is full of organic compounds released by plants and ""when you breathe them in, some molecules pass into the bloodstream."" Willis says pine is a good example of this as the smell of a pine forest can make you calmer within just 90 seconds and that effect lasts for about 10 minutes. You may think that the relaxing effect of nature is all in your mind, but another study found that even very young babies with no memory associated with particular smells, still calmed down when another scent associated with calming, limonene   was puffed into the room they were in. 4. Gets good bacteria into your gut Getty Images Touching soil can help your body adopt good bacteria As well as soothing your mind, nature can also help boost your microbiome as soil and plants are full of good bacteria. ""They're the same kinds of good bacteria we pay for in probiotics or drinks,"" Willis explains. Prof Ming Kuo has studied the effect on factors such as infection susceptibility as well as mental health and says breathing in certain ones have the potential to boost your mood; and the antimicrobial chemicals released by plants – called phytoncides – could help fight disease. Dr Chris van Tulleken says as an infection scientist he sees nature as a positively challenging environment that ""tickles your immune system"". He gets his children to play with dirt in the forest which then enters their system through the nose or mouth. Bring nature to you Getty Images Even having a nature screensaver on your laptop can help you relax Of course, not everyone can head into the woods on a whim but the good news is, you don't have to. Even small touches of nature at home can make a difference, according to Willis. Visually, flowers such as white or yellow roses have been shown to create the greatest calming effect on brain activity. When it comes to smell, use a diffuser with essential oils like pinene which can help you feel calm. And if all else fails, even a photo of a forest can help. Research shows that looking at pictures of nature on your laptop or simply gazing out at something green can trigger the same calming brainwave changes and reduce stress. ""Every bit seems to help,"" says Prof Ming Kuo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0yvdjgn5o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg,2025-10-09T23:45:15.516000+00:00,fea44fd8e8d7d4a0ae48c30d3910c9ca7b0d57fd

At the end of August the waiting list for routine treatments hit 7.41 million – in May it was 7.36 million. The proportion waiting longer than the target time of 18 weeks has also risen. Experts said the government was facing a significant challenge reducing waits, but ministers said its investment in the NHS would pay off. The government has promised that by the end of this parliament it will hit the 18-week waiting time target – something that has not been done for a decade. That requires 92% of patients, waiting for treatments such as knee and hip operations, to be seen within 18 weeks. Currently, 61% are. Over the summer waits worsened following a period of sustained progress after Labour came to power. Dr Francesca Cavallaro, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said on current trends the government would fall short on its pledge. ""The scale of the challenge remains significant."" Prof Peter Friend, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, predicted the coming winter would be tough. ""The government must face facts: without urgent investment in NHS infrastructure and support for staff wellbeing, progress on reducing waiting times will remain slow. ""Surgeons are ready to do more but are held back by critical resource issues - a lack of operating time, staff vacancies and equipment. Patients deserve better."" Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, said: ""NHS leaders and their teams are working incredibly hard to boost productivity. So it is deeply frustrating that waiting lists have gone up for the third month in a row. But Health Minister Stephen Kinnock defended the performance of the NHS. He said it had been a ""record-breaking"" summer with more tests and checks being done than ever before. ""We know there's more to do - that's why we're pressing ahead with new surgical hubs, evening and weekend scans, and cutting-edge technology to get millions more patients treated on time,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje5ljdnygo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a2f1/live/3869b8b0-a4f9-11f0-8e74-1f6664d312e9.jpg,2025-10-09T10:24:23.722000+00:00,a23c931a07404d6450a9536580ce43ced5fd0e52
dfd715e888a9,"Children harmed by decision to redeploy health visitors, Covid inquiry hears",,"Children harmed by decision to redeploy health visitors, Covid inquiry hears Vanessa Clarke Education reporter Getty Images A decision by the NHS to redeploy health visitors during the pandemic was ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""children were harmed"" as a result, the head of a health visiting charity has told the Covid inquiry. Many health visitors were sent to work in other parts of the NHS at the beginning of the pandemic. Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting, told the inquiry it was ""inappropriate"" as they ""were needed most on their own front line"". NHS England's Chief Nursing Officer Duncan Burton told the inquiry its response to safeguarding did not stop throughout the pandemic despite staff being diverted to critical services. Health visitors in almost two thirds of trusts in England were redeployed in March 2020, according to research by University College London. The intention was that they would go to work in hospitals to support acutely ill patients but some were sent to do administration, to deliver parcels and to answer telephones, the inquiry heard. Some health visitors who remained in post were left with case loads of 750 children or more, way above the recommended 250, evidence provided by Prof Catherine Davies, of Leeds University, to the inquiry showed. ""We let families down"", Ms Morton told the inquiry, saying protection was not afforded to babies and that ""some children paid the highest price"". The inquiry was shown research by the child safeguarding review practice panel which identified Covid adaptions, such as virtual visits as opposed to home visits by health visitors, as factors in the deaths and serious incidents of some children. Children like Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes - who were both killed by their guardians during the pandemic - hit the headlines but there were many others, Ms Morton told the inquiry. ""Children were being harmed by these practices,"" she said. ""It had life-changing and life-ending consequences for these children and they were the canary in the coalmine and we needed to listen to them and make their voices count even in their deaths"". ""For me, it was the most sad part of the pandemic, how we let those children down"", Ms Morton added. The Institute of Health Visiting - a charity and professional body that works to strengthen the quality and consistency of health visiting practice - said it was in regular contact with the government in the summer of 2020 raising concerns. It said a letter was eventually sent by the Chief Nursing Officer for England to trusts in October 2020 saying redeployments must end. The body also had to make ""a strong intervention"" for there not to be another redeployment in December 2020, the inquiry was told. The inquiry is due to hear evidence from those who were in government at the time in the next two weeks. Earlier, Duncan Burton, the Chief Nursing Officer for England told the inquiry, at the start of pandemic, the NHS was dealing with a new virus and staff had to be freed up to help with critical services. He said NHS England's response to safeguarding activity did not stop throughout the pandemic but it did change. ""For example, we made sure that the staff in testing centres were trained around safeguarding and what the things they might need to look for. ""And as more clinical contacts happened online, we needed to make sure that the kind of guidance around online factored in the safeguarding needs of children."" The inquiry also heard about the decision by the NHS to keep children out of the healthcare system unless essential and to pause elective procedures for children in March 2020. The NHS was focusing on freeing up beds for critical care, the inquiry heard, and Mr Burton said ""we had to focus on that"". They did not suggest stopping anything that was urgent, Mr Burton said but ""there was a balance of prioritisation"". Children's waiting lists grew at twice the rate of adult list during the recovery period after the pandemic, NHS England data which was shown to the inquiry indicated. Mr Burton's evidence noted that children's procedures being seen ""as less of a priority compared to, for example, adult cancer treatment"" was one of the reasons for the rise in children's waiting lists size. He said the fact that children's operations are mainly done in more specialist hospitals and there is a smaller workforce might also have added to delays. Some of the biggest waiting lists are for speech and language appointments - with schools seeing a huge increase in students needing additional help. Children were ""hugely and in some cases irretrievably damaged"" by the indirect consequences of the pandemic, Prof Steve Turner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told the inquiry. ""They are 25% of the population and get 11% of the NHS spend."" They are not treated equally in our society and became a lower priority in the pandemic and in the recovery period, Prof Turner said. This part of the Covid inquiry is looking at the impact of the pandemic on children and young people, and whether they were considered in key decisions made by government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz3n126kwo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8c97/live/867a0080-a465-11f0-8c79-29eeaf2ea52d.jpg,2025-10-08T18:42:37.026000+00:00,b419a1e101fccb6f90398e813c9e0f82105f39e2
d5c48e21652f,Pharmacies facing angry patients over Covid jab confusion,,"Pharmacies facing angry patients over Covid jab confusion Nick Triggle health correspondent and Jim Reed health reporter PA Media (File photo) Pharmacists in England say they are facing ""major issues"" with large numbers of patients booking appointments for Covid jabs only to find they are no longer eligible. The criteria have been tightened this year so that only those aged 75 and older are being offered free boosters, along with younger patients who have a weakened immune system. Between a third and a half of people who turn up for their appointment are having to be turned away at many sites, according to Community Pharmacy England (CPE), which represents more than 10,000 chemists including many major chains. It has described the situation as ""unacceptable"" with reports of angry, frustrated patients and abuse aimed at staff. CPE director of NHS services Alastair Buxton said it had become clear within an hour of the NHS website booking system going live last week that there was a problem. He said lots of people appeared to be missing the information about eligibility on the booking system and making the assumption they were still eligible. But when they turn up for their vaccinations pharmacies are only able to give them the flu jab. ""That obviously takes a lot of explaining to patients. It causes upset, concern and maybe anger for some patients. ""We've certainly had examples of some patients becoming abusive with pharmacy team members."" As well as shouting abuse, Dr Leyla Hannbeck, of the Independent Pharmacies Association, said she was even aware of patients throwing objects at staff. ""This is unacceptable,"" she added. Patients have also been telling Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have been receiving text messages from the NHS and their GP asking them to come forward for their Covid jab despite not being eligible. Henry Gregg, head of the National Pharmacy Association, which represents independent pharmacists, says the issues have been raised with NHS England and the government. ""This should have been avoidable and it is deeply frustrating for both pharmacies and patients. We urge any patient in this situation to treat pharmacy teams with respect as pharmacies try and manage the new NHS clinical criteria."" Pharmacists said more should have been done to make people aware of the changes - given the flu and Covid vaccine programmes largely over-lapped last year. In response to the problems, NHS England said the wording on the website had been changed to make it clearer the eligibility criteria had been tightened. A spokeswoman added: ""Please double check you are still eligible to receive a Covid vaccine before booking – the NHS website sets out whether your age, health condition or medication means you are eligible, and your GP practice or pharmacist will confirm this before giving you the vaccine."" And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Abuse of our hard-working pharmacists is totally unacceptable - we expect pharmacy providers to report any inappropriate incidents where necessary."" Family handout Paul Williamson, 71, says he was disappointed to find out he was no longer eligible for the Covid vaccine Paul Williamson, aged 71, from Doncaster, is one of those who has only just discovered he is no longer eligible for the Covid booster. He did realise when he logged on to the booking site and told Your Voice, Your BBC News he was shocked to find out the criteria had changed. ""I'm disappointed. It feels like a cost-cutting exercise."" As an older person, he said he would do everything possible to protect himself and so would now consider paying for it privately. Covid vaccines are available privately at high street pharmacists and cost around £100 per person. Changes in eligibility The changes to eligibility were made on the advice of a group of independent experts called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). It recommended that eligibility for the Covid autumn booster should be changed from 2025. Last year the jab was offered for free to anyone 65 years old and over and those with a long list of chronic or long-term conditions. That's now been changed with the age limit raised to all those who turn 75 before January 2026, plus residents in care homes for older adults and people classed as immunosuppressed. That includes those undergoing some cancer treatment and transplant patients, along with those living with HIV and some genetic disorders. But it means many people with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illneses, asthma and severe mental illness will no longer qualify. In addition, pregnant women and frontline health and social care workers will not be offered the jab for free this autumn. The JCVI said Covid was now a ""relatively mild disease for most people"", with rates of hospitalisation and death having ""reduced significantly"". It said focusing on the oldest adults and individuals whose immune systems are compromised, as the two groups who continue to be at higher risk, was based on ""a standard cost-effectiveness assessment, in line with other routine vaccinations"".

Dorinnia Carville said about 12,000 operations, which include tummy tucks and tonsillectomies, were carried out in 2023-24 without any assurance they complied with government policy. Ms Carville described the lack of oversight by the Department of Health and the trusts as ""very disappointing"". The Department of Health and the five health trusts acknowledged the concerns raised in the Audit Office report and accepted that oversight arrangements must be strengthened. Health trusts must adhere to the Effective Use of Resources (EUR) policy which restricts 29 medical procedures, with six of these not permitted at all. The Audit Office report found 40 restricted procedures were carried out each day during that year. Other restricted procedures include liposuction, breast reduction, removal of breast implants, carpal tunnel and tattoo removal. About £6m was spent in a single year on removing patients' tonsils. Dorinnia Carville's report found health trusts had not put any arrangements in place to verify this Procedures such as the repair of split ear lobes, fixing simple snoring and the reversal of male and female sterilisation are not permitted. The auditor general found the EUR policy was ""not resulting in good value for money being achieved"". She said: ""Trusts have not put in place arrangements to verify that medical staff are complying with the policy."" ""At a time when our health service is facing increased demands and significant financial pressures, measures introduced to ensure the effective use of resources are vital. ""However, these can only be successful if they are properly implemented and monitored."" While some of the thousands of procedures performed may have been permissible under the policy, the report found health trusts had not put any arrangements in place to verify this. No such assurances were provided by trusts during 2023-24, and none was sought by the department, said the auditor general. The report recommends that trusts introduce arrangements for monitoring and complying with the rules, and for the Department of Health to ensure they are doing so. It is also calling on the department to review the rules policy every two years. The Department of Health said it was committed to working collaboratively over the next 12 months to implement the recommendations. ""It must be emphasised that the EUR commissioning position is there to guide clinicians who must continue to exercise their professional judgment in providing appropriate, timely care,"" a spokesperson added. ""While there is an onus to take account of the position, other factors must also be taken into account, including patient safety.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq6x94np6o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ee72/live/14279840-a455-11f0-8a21-ff96e44d1cc2.jpg,2025-10-08T07:01:32.803000+00:00,6ff642adf1ac17ca57283dbee059e34fea1f0ba3
4f2df46a9593,'My eyesight might have been saved if I'd gone to the optician sooner',,"'My eyesight might have been saved if I'd gone to the optician sooner' Aileen Moynagh BBC News NI health reporter 'Had I known that you could have such a sudden loss of sight, I wouldn't have waited' A woman who has been left with partial sight after she delayed seeking medical help said she wishes she had gone to an optician when she first had symptoms as her vision could have been saved. Gail Cairns, from Belfast, started experiencing sight loss, headaches, and eye pain in July 2025, but waited four days before getting her eyes checked. After being scanned at an opticians through a free NHS scheme she was immediately referred to hospital for treatment. She had a serious eye condition that had left permanent damage. Getty Images Detailed scans by the optician showed damage to her optic nerve because of swelling in her brain Mrs Cairns was diagnosed with Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NA-AION) and Pseudo Foster-Kennedy syndrome. Detailed scans by the optician showed damage to her optic nerve because of swelling in her brain. She was treated in hospital with steroids to reduce the swelling, but said ""unfortunately the damage was done"". It has been ""life changing"" and she can no longer drive. ""If I had known about this condition and how quickly things can change, I would have gone on the Monday. ""The likelihood is that I would still be able to drive, and do all the normal things that I was doing,"" she said. The 60-year-old said day-to-day things like cooking, going up and down stairs, reading to her grandchildren and putting on make-up are now difficult. But she said the ""hardest part was in the hospital whenever my three-year-old granddaughter was sitting on the bed, and I couldn't make out any of her features"". ""I just took a lump in my throat, and it was like somebody punched me in the stomach. ""That was the first time I teared up over it,"" she said. Mrs Cairns had annual eye tests because of a family history of glaucoma but wants to encourage anyone with sudden changes in their eyes to act quickly. ""Even the slightest change - don't put it off - get it seen to by an optician immediately."" She is thankful that she has not lost her sight completely. Much like a GP, an optometrist is a primary care provider who is specialised in detecting and correcting conditions that affect vision and eye health. An optometrist is trained to recognise abnormalities in eyes, and many provide enhanced services, including same day NIPEARS appointments for urgent eye care issues, like how Mrs Cairns was seen. It is a service for patients who have developed a sudden eye problem within the previous 14 days, such as: Pain and/or discomfort in the eyes, or around the eye area Sudden reduction in vision in one or both eyes Recent onset or sudden increase of flashes and/or floaters in one or both eyes Something in your eye that you cannot remove yourself Sam Baird stresses the importance of early intervention The service has been running since 2018, with more than 90% of practices providing the service, including Sam Baird's in Dundonald where Mrs Cairns went. ""Gail came in at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon with very painful eyes, not able to see clearly. ""We got drops to make her eyes more comfortable. We scanned her and assessed that she needed urgent attention at the hospital,"" he said. He was able to provide her with the scans of the optic nerve, ""which are diagnostic of the condition, which meant that when she got to the Ulster Hospital she was admitted immediately as opposed to waiting for hours"". This meant Mrs Cairns could start treatment immediately. Mr Baird stressed the importance of getting your eyes checked as soon as symptoms appear as sight loss can happen very quickly. While he said Mrs Cairn's case is rare, if she'd come in earlier in the week there might have been a different outcome. ""Those are the small cases where it can make a very dramatic difference. ""Opticians have the specialised equipment to do proper scans and a proper investigation of the eyes - something that the emergency room and GPs don't have."" Mr Baird said the NIPEARS system is reducing pressure on ""two ends"" of the health service. ""We're taking the pressure off the GPs by taking care of minor eye conditions and we're taking pressure off the ophthalmology hospital clinics because they're not  filled with unnecessary referrals,"" he said. According to the Royal National Institute of Blind people (RNIB) , every day 250 people start to lose their sight in the UK, which is equivalent to one person every six minutes. The charity says more than two million people are living with sight loss in the UK and half of them are blind and partially sighted and live with a long-term irreversible eye health condition. The RNIB said it is predicted that by 2050 the number of people with sight loss in the UK will double to more than four million. Raymond Curran says half of all sight loss is avoidable In September 2025, the Department of Health (DoH) highlighted the ""vital role of community optometry in improving access to care and shaping the future of eyecare in Northern Ireland"". Raymond Curran, the DoH's Head of Ophthalmic Services is encouraging people to look after their eyes as ""50% of all sight loss is avoidable"". He said ""primary care optometrists"" should be the first port of call for eyes, as GPs are experiencing capacity issues. ED eye departments are struggling to cope with increased demand. The DoH said it is committed to making it easier for patients to access the care they need, and that community optometry shows how services delivered closer to home can detect problems early, reduce waiting lists, and ease pressure on hospitals.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87yzywrrdjo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4a7e/live/02e28580-a528-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-08T23:10:14.783000+00:00,4921fee5ac3ce09ce92e90abb1217c12054b330e
c3dbf0dd6f4d,"Alarming number of people now vape, says WHO",,"Alarming number of people now vape, says WHO Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Getty Images More than 100 million people, including at least 15 million children, use e-cigarettes, fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction, the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning. Children are, on average, nine times more likely than adults to vape, it says, based on available global figures. The WHO's Dr Etienne Krug said e-cigarettes were fuelling a ""new wave"" of nicotine addiction. ""They are marketed as harm reduction but, in reality, are hooking kids on nicotine earlier and risk undermining decades of progress."" WHO Director General, Dr Tedros, accused the tobacco industry of ""aggressively targeting"" young people. Teens being 'targeted' ""Millions of people are stopping, or not taking up, tobacco use thanks to tobacco control efforts by countries around the world,"" he said. ""In response to this strong progress, the tobacco industry is fighting back with new nicotine products, aggressively targeting young people. Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco-control policies,"" he added. The vaping figures are an estimate since some countries - 109 in all, and many in African and South-East Asia - do not gather data. According to the report, as of February this year, at least 86 million e-cigarette users were adults, mostly in high-income countries. And at least 15 million teenagers aged between 13 and 15  already vape, based on surveys from 123 countries. While many nations have made efforts to introduce e-cigarettes regulations to tackle child vaping in recent years, by the end of 2024, 62 countries still had no policy in place, and 74 countries had no minimum age at which e-cigarettes may be purchased, says the WHO. Meanwhile, tobacco use has been decreasing - from an estimated 1.38 billion users in 2000 to 1.2 billion in 2024. Prevalence of tobacco use among women dropped the most - from 11% in 2010 to 6.6% in 2024. Among men, the decrease was from 41.4% in 2010 to 32.5% in 2024. But one in five adults globally still uses tobacco. Smoking is linked to many diseases, including cancer. Experts say vaping is far less harmful than cigarettes, and can help you quit smoking. It is not recommended for non-smokers. E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco and do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most damaging elements in tobacco smoke. They contain nicotine, which can be addictive.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kwxjzeez3o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0150/live/57488580-a2bb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-06T12:34:03.707000+00:00,b5f645df12dab4fa0ff17f2eaada8b574fe3fb84
5685024f493e,First-year resident doctors back strike action over jobs shortage,,"Newly-qualified doctors in their first year of practice in England have voted in favour of strike action in a row over a shortage of jobs. The British Medical Association (BMA) union says thousands of resident doctors are ending up without speciality training places when they finish year two of training. This year there were 10,000 jobs available for 30,000 candidates, although some of those will be doctors from abroad. The issue was already being discussed by the BMA and government in talks that got under way following a pay strike in July. But by formally gaining a mandate for strike action it opens up a new avenue for industrial action. Some 97% of those who voted back strike action on a turnout of 65%. Dr Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said: ""Doctors have spoken clearly - they won't accept that they face a career of insecurity at a time when the demand for doctors is huge. ""The numbers are absurd - more than 10,000 doctors applied this year to become psychiatrists with less than 500 able to get a place, yet patients are still experiencing significant waits at a detriment to their health."" GP unemployment is getting worse, he said, with five doctors applying for every GP training post, while patient demand for appointments continues to increase. ""It makes no sense that despite the need to bring down waiting lists and increase capacity for patients to be seen, thousands of willing and skilled doctors are unable to find the work to begin treating them."" He described the government's current pledge – set out under the 10-year NHS plan – to increase training places by 1,000 as paltry. The BMA has argued a big factor in the shortage has been poor workforce planning which has seen a rapid expansion in medical school places at university, but a failure to create enough training posts in the NHS. Dr Fletcher added: ""By putting these two disputes – pay and jobs – together, we are now giving government a chance to create a plan that supports and develops the workforce of the next generation. ""Patients need doctors to have jobs. Doctors need to know they will have jobs. And they need to know they will be paid what they're worth."" Health Secretary Wes Streeting, however, has been adamant that he will not negotiate on pay and, instead, his team have kept the talks centred on working conditions, exam fees, rotas and career progression. It comes after resident doctors were awarded a 22% pay rise over the last two years, with another 5.4% increase this year. The BMA says pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: ""Training bottlenecks are a very real issue for resident doctors, which is why the government is already working on a range of measures to tackle them."" Alongside the additional 1,000 training places, he said steps were also being taken to prioritise UK graduates for posts. ""The result is that current first-year doctors will emerge from their foundation training into a very different professional landscape from that which exists today,"" he added.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly147075p2o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b567/live/b3b82fb0-a2dd-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T18:51:14.420000+00:00,1a8b5ba7819c67cbb20ad9b1cc80e67f284d1464
fe2b6b67dcc7,Former England captain Moody reveals MND diagnosis,,"Elite athletes are disproportionately affected by MND, with a study of Italian footballers suggesting the rate of the disease is up to six times higher than in the general population. It is thought that by limiting the oxygen available and causing damage to motor neurone cells, regular, strenuous exercise can trigger the disease in those already genetically susceptible. Moody, who won 71 England caps and toured with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand in 2005, was nicknamed 'Mad Dog' during his playing career, in honour of his fearless, relentless approach to the game. He played through a stress fracture of his leg for a time with Leicester and once sparked a training-ground scuffle with team-mate and friend Martin Johnson when, frustrated, he abandoned a tackle pad and started throwing himself into tackles. After coming on as a replacement in the Rugby World Cup final win over Australia in 2003, he claimed a ball at the back of the line-out in the decisive passage of play, setting a platform for scrum-half Matt Dawson to snipe and Jonny Wilkinson to kick the match-winning drop-goal. Moody has already told Johnson, who captained England to that title, and a couple of other former England team-mates about his diagnosis. Geordan Murphy and Leon Lloyd, who Moody played alongside at Leicester, have set up a fundraising page to help support him and his family. But many of Moody's former team-mates will be learning his news with the rest of the public. ""There will be a time when we'll need to lean on their support but, at the minute, just having that sort of love and acknowledgment that people are there is all that matters,"" he said. ""Rugby is such a great community. ""I said to the kids the other day, I've had an incredible life. ""Even if it ended now, I've enjoyed all of it and embraced all of it and got to do it with unbelievable people. ""When you get to call your passion your career, it's one of the greatest privileges. ""To have done it for so long with the teams that I did it with was a pleasure.

1f2e5b95d6dd,Top NHS boss backed surgeon whose failures contributed to deaths,,"Top NHS boss backed surgeon whose failures contributed to deaths Michael Buchanan Social affairs correspondent and Adam Eley LinkedIn Karen Booth carried out operations she wasn't skilled enough to perform, an NHS investigation found The head of NHS England backed a doctor whose failures contributed to several deaths to resume her career as a heart surgeon. Sir Jim Mackey told the family of a patient who died following an operation carried out by Karen Booth that the consultant surgeon should be ""supported"" to continue working at the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, once she had undergone retraining. The BBC has obtained a recording of a meeting last year with the family of the man who died. In it, he tells them Ms Booth will continue her surgical career. An NHS investigation found problems in Ms Booth's cases included clinical errors, carrying out operations she was not skilled or experienced enough to perform, and failing to call for help when she should have. Sir Jim became head of NHS England in April. Before that he was chief executive of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Freeman, for 14 months. Sir Jim declined to answer most of the BBC's questions but said: ""We have taken concerns from all parties extremely seriously and this has been a really complex case in what is a very specialised clinical field, and it had been ongoing for several years."" In a statement to the BBC, Karen Booth said she continued ""to express my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by the matters raised"".  She said she was ""cooperating fully"" with a review by the doctors' regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). Sir Jim Mackey told the family Ms Booth ""has to go through a process of being supported, retrained"" Seven people died following multiple failures by Ms Booth, an internal investigation found, with one patient surviving having experienced avoidable harm. The BBC has revealed the hospital now plans to allow Ms Booth to resume her surgical career in the cardiac unit after retraining. That is despite strong opposition from many of her surgical colleagues, set out in emails. Ms Booth, a heart and transplant surgeon , is currently working as a mentor to other surgeons at the hospital. In January 2024, shortly after being appointed as chief executive of the trust, Sir Jim met the family of Ian Philip, a construction worker from Northumberland, who died in 2021 aged 54, after being operated on by Ms Booth. The hospital later told his family that the surgeons operating on him had failed to carry out a ""bread and butter"" procedure known as a graft bypass when they experienced complications, something that the hospital told them would have made his survival ""much more likely"". The BBC obtained a recording of a meeting attended by Mr Philip's partner Melissa Cockburn and his son Liam. Sir Jim told them Ms Booth could continue her surgical career because she had not been sanctioned by the GMC or by an internal HR investigation. Family photo Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust has apologised to Ian Philip's family over the care he received ""She has to go through a process of being supported, retrained, her practice managed etc over a period of time before she's allowed to practise fully independently again,"" said Sir Jim. ""We, as an employer, have to decide whether that is here or somewhere else."" The BBC understands the Freeman Hospital has approached at least one other trust to ask whether they would be willing to employ Ms Booth. Mr Philip's family told the BBC they were astonished by Sir Jim's remarks. ""It's bizarre to me that the Freeman would think that it's appropriate [to bring her back],"" said Ian's son, Liam Philip. ""The least they can do is say she's not coming back."" Sir Jim became chief executive of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust on 1 January 2024. The family said they had hoped his appointment at the trust would help their case. ""[We] went through Christmas with great hope, thinking he's a new man coming in to sort everything out,"" recalled Melissa, Mr Philip's partner. But she said she had ultimately found Sir Jim ""quite arrogant and more supportive of Ms Booth than our predicament"". Many of Ms Booth's surgical colleagues had made it repeatedly clear to the trust's senior leadership that they did not want her to return to the cardiac unit, believing it a risk to patients. This was an issue Sir Jim also appeared to recognise. At one point in the meeting, he said that if colleagues were not willing to support a surgeon, ""the risk to safety is much heightened."" In her statement, Ms Booth said she was ""grateful to those surgical and wider departmental colleagues who continue to support my reintegration back into full clinical practice"". Ian Philip's partner, Melissa Cockburn and son Liam, say they were shocked by Sir Jim's comments The family said their unhappiness with Sir Jim has been exacerbated by the fact the GMC had lifted restrictions on Ms Booth's practice following an initial investigation. Asked to explain why a doctor whose failures had contributed to the deaths of multiple patients was allowed to continue practising surgery in the NHS and what this says about the importance it places on public safety, the GMC declined to comment. It told the BBC: ""Patient safety is at the core of everything we do, and we will always take action where there is a risk to the public."" When asked to give examples, it declined. Patient groups have long complained that the GMC takes too long to take action against medics. It can investigate doctors who are referred to it and decide whether a case is passed to a medical tribunal, which has the power to sanction staff. Figures show that since 2020, of the 1,120 cases the GMC has passed to a medical tribunal, just 13 were to do with a doctor's performance. Asked to explain why the figures are so low, the GMC declined to comment. Problematic working culture In a statement to the BBC, Sir Jim said that after joining the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Trust, he had met families affected by Ms Booth's failures ""to discuss and listen to their concerns and reiterate how sorry we are for their loss and the unimaginable hurt caused"". Mr Mackey continued: ""Following the formal referral made to the General Medical Council in 2022, the investigation into this surgeon's practice is still ongoing – I recognise this is frustrating for everyone, and I have asked them what they can do to expedite this to reach a conclusion as soon as possible. ""This surgeon is still not operating in the NHS."" Ms Booth said that due to the GMC review, ""it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on specific matters at this time"". An investigation by the Freeman Hospital found a number of failures by Ms Booth had contributed to her poor outcomes. As well as surgical errors, she was found to have had poor insight into her own levels of competence, partly through being inexperienced, and that she had failed to seek help from more senior colleagues. At the time of the complaints, the cardiac unit at the Freeman was in disarray. A Royal College of Surgeons report in 2021 found a problematic working culture, while internal hospital reports criticised poor governance procedures, a reluctance from senior staff to take responsibility and an inadequate multi-disciplinary team (MDT) process - in which clinicians should come together prior to surgery to discuss the best options for patients. Responding to the BBC, the hospital acknowledged the problems with the unit's culture, saying it tried to protect patients at all times. It said it was ""currently considering"" the next stage of Ms Booth's phased return, ""in line with appropriate standards, review recommendations and external advice"". It did not respond to the BBC's questions as to whether it was safe for patients for Ms Booth to return to the cardiac unit, given the strong opposition from some of her colleagues. In a statement, the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust said it acts ""in the best interests of patients"" and seeks ""to maintain and protect patient safety at all times, taking account of concerns shared by clinical colleagues"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rpdjd39po,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04a1/live/6b953710-a034-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-03T02:08:52.258000+00:00,f4ed2f02b4ff28007750cdc42a5322b603a8d60d

Alice Cunningham in Brandeston Richard Knights/BBC Chantal Chaervey has struggled for years to get her son with cerebral palsy access to healthcare services since he turned 18 When Chantal Chaervey's son with cerebral palsy lost access to healthcare services at 18, she did not imagine she would be fighting four years on to change this. As a child, Harry Chaervey, 22, from Brandeston, Suffolk, was diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy, a condition that affects movement and co-ordination. Throughout his time at a specialist school, Harry, who is non-verbal, enjoyed access to hydrotherapy — a form of physiotherapy involving exercise in a warm pool that helps with movement. But when he left school, his mother struggled to get him access through the NHS and believed without it, his life would be limited. Ms Chaervey, 65, said the past few years had been ""hell"" and she called for answers. Alice Cunningham/BBC Ms Chaervey said Harry was born with a rare condition that later led to his cerebral palsy and epilepsy diagnosis Ms Chaervey explained Harry had two liver transplants when he was just 16 and 18 weeks old, but both failed, leading to organ failure and brain damage before he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. She said despite that, he had always been ""a joy"", and as a child, he loved to play football. ""No one could stop him from running,"" she explained. ""I've got a very vivid image of a teacher trying to control him on sports day, holding him by the seat of his shorts because he just wanted to run. ""He was a joy, and he still is. However all of a sudden things changed."" Contributed Harry benefited from hydrotherapy at his specialist school and during a previous holiday camp Ms Chaervey said without the hydrotherapy, Harry had ""completely lost the use of his legs"", meaning when he wants to move, he either has to shuffle on his knees or he has to use a wheelchair. She said he was in ""constant"" pain, his epilepsy had worsened, he was at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, and he struggled to chew food, sometimes leading to choking. Ms Chaervey said Harry was also suffering from depression. Alice Cunningham/BBC Ms Chaervey said she had hoped to eventually return to her career, but could not see this happening without help to care for her son Ms Chaervey applied for NHS Continuing Healthcare that could have funded Harry's care, but she was told he was not eligible. She then applied for two exceptional funding requests to get him access to hydrotherapy, but they were similarly denied. Earlier this year, she applied for a third time and was still waiting to hear back. It comes despite doctors and physiotherapists recommending Harry for hydrotherapy, with one stating in a letter that it ""may well end up being more than any medication change that I can make"". Ms Chaervey said access to hydrotherapy would mean ""everything"" to Harry, and she believed just half an hour a week could help. Contributed Ms Chaervey said Harry could not stop moving as a child and enjoyed running around Heather Epps, a physiotherapist with expertise in hydrotherapy for cerebral palsy patients, said it could ""improve quality of life"" thanks to the benefits it had in pain reduction and its ability to improve muscle function. ""One of the reasons you get pain is because your muscles are pulling against your bones, pulling them into abnormal positions, so your posture isn't great and then because your posture isn't great, it becomes a bit of a vicious cycle,"" she explained. ""You can't fidget and move, as you or I could, in order to relieve that pressure and reduce that discomfort. ""Whereas once you're in the pool, you can undertake those movements because you've not got that increase in spasticity and stiffness within your muscles that you have when you're out of the water."" Emma Livingstone formed the charity Up when she found there was a lack of provisions for adults with cerebral palsy Emma Livingstone is the founder and chief executive officer of charity Up - The Adult Cerebral Palsy Movement. She said access to healthcare services for adults with cerebral palsy, of which there are about 130,000 in the UK, was a serious issue, and she herself had struggled. ""We are comparably sized to Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's, and yet our visibility and the services that we do receive pale in significance,"" she said. She said the issue stemmed from the fact that the condition, up until recently, was not recognised as being long-term, as well as the fact that there was ""no one professional that coordinates care"" for cerebral palsy patients due there being many types of cerebral palsy. Richard Knights/BBC Because Harry cannot walk, he will shuffle on his knees around his home Ms Chaervey wants answers to why there is no clear NHS framework for adults with cerebral palsy. ""How is it that the care they have needed all their younger lives is not needed as they get older,"" she questioned. ""Are they suddenly cured, because if they are, please tell me, it would make my life better. ""It is a complete farce. It is time the NHS realised there are cerebral palsy adult patients with very complex situations suffering with chronic pain every hour of every day."" 'Happy to talk' A spokesperson for NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board said all applications for exceptional funding were considered by a panel of healthcare professionals, ""with a focus on the clinical needs of the patient"". ""Where an application is not successful, there is an appeals process open to all,"" they added. ""We'd be very happy to talk directly with the family of the patient to explain the situation."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care added it was ""committed to ensuring people living with cerebral palsy get the right support throughout their lives"". ""We expect NHS England to work with children, young people, families and carers to provide high-quality services, such as hydrotherapy, for people as they transition into adult services,"" they said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dr4v3vz3lo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8053/live/69655560-a04d-11f0-b76f-25c45ed3060d.jpg,2025-10-07T05:11:11.357000+00:00,1201e558a7a24580ec093e0d87db91cdce8be5c6
5e5722bd11f0,"Is it a cold, flu or Covid – and how to avoid the worst",,"Is it a cold, flu or Covid – and how to avoid the worst Dr Oscar Duke Doctor and BBC Morning Live expert, London Getty Images Chances are you know someone coughing and spluttering - hopefully not directly on you -  right now. There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds as autumn draws in. But why now, how do you know if it's more than just a cold and how can you avoid the worst. Medical doctor Dr Oscar Duke, who is also a regular TV presenter including on the BBC's Morning Live, shares his top tips. Does colder weather cause colds? Getty Images Research on the extent to which cold weather impacts our immune systems remains unclear. But darker days mean we typically make a beeline for warm, cosy, indoor spaces. And this environment is perfect for viruses. It's also when young children get back together at school after the summer holidays. School and nursery can be like a petri dish with lots of viruses circulating and they may well bring these germs home with them. The same applies to freshers in university halls - where mixing together spreads germs, while heavy drinking and partying further weaken the immune system. Is it a cold, flu or Covid? Colds Symptoms appear gradually Mostly affect nose and throat Early sign - pressure in your ears Chestier, mucus cough Flu Comes on suddenly Feel wiped out Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion Need bed rest Dry cough Covid Typical flu symptoms Loss of taste of smell Diarrhoea or tummy upset Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid, overlap. But there are some clues that might help you identify the exact culprit. If a cold's coming on, then it often does so gradually. It's going to affect your nose and the back of your throat, while some will get a tickling at the back of the mouth. Another early warning sign can be a build-up of pressure in the ear. If the virus spreads further, it can reach your lungs and cause a pesky cough. Mostly however, these symptoms don't stop us from carrying on as normal. The same can't be said for flu, which typically adds aches, fevers and muscle weakness into the mix. Flu doesn't mean you have to go to bed, but it might make you feel that way. Since the pandemic, Covid has complicated things further, with similar symptons to flu. But one key Covid-specific identifier can be a loss of smell or taste. Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a ""razor-sharp"" sore throat . Diarrhoea is also common. The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice. Can I help make myself better? Getty Images Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. Paracetamol: Provided you're okay to take it, this or ibuprofen is the first port of call. Both are really good for helping to bring the fever down and softening any pain that you might have. But remember that lots of cough and cold mixtures include traces of paracetamol, so make sure you're not accidentally taking too much Vitamin C: This is often thought to help defend against colds. But there's not a huge amount of evidence for this. Unless you're deficient, focusing on a healthy, balanced diet is far more important Other stories you may enjoy Vitamin D: A top-up of vitamin D in colder months is recommended by the NHS, because let's face it, we don't usually get much sunlight at this time of year in the UK Decongestant spray: Sure, they feel great and provide instant relief, but using sprays too often can cause rebound congestion- when your nose becomes dependent and swells without a fix. I suggest using them for no more than four of five days Chicken soup: There's little evidence of the dish fighting viruses directly, but its heat can help warm the back of your throat and soothe some of those symptoms. It's also a good way to take on extra fluids, with hydration vital as you battle infection. What about vaccines? Getty Images It's  crucial to take the free annual flu jab if you're offered it. Eligibility is staggered across the population to prioritise those most at risk. If you have small children who were two or three on 31 August this year, then they are entitled. Older children will be offered theirs at school. Find out more and book on the NHS website , or visit your GP.

8d97e7ca08a9,I went undercover as a cleaner at a failing care home. Here's what I witnessed,,"I went undercover as a cleaner at a failing care home. Here's what I witnessed Catriona MacPhee BBC Scotland Disclosure BBC Catriona worked for seven weeks as a cleaner at the care home In my seven weeks undercover in an overstretched care home I witnessed many scenes of poor care and distress but there was one incident that I suspect will remain with me for a long time. On the worst days, when staffing was at its lowest levels, the residents would sometimes shout for help as they heard my cleaning trolley rumbling past their rooms. Some were desperate for help to go to the toilet, others simply wanted to get washed and dressed for the day. As a cleaner, there was little I could do except offer words of comfort and assurances that I'd told the care staff. One day I sat with a woman in a nightie who needed help to be taken from her bed to the bathroom, just 8ft away. Her room echoed with signs of a life well lived - a proud career, foreign holidays with her loving family, an immaculately curated wardrobe of cashmere cardigans. As we waited for a carer to come, she begged me not to leave. She was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I tried to distract her with small talk about the view and the weather. She listened until she could no longer hide her distress. As her physical capacity to wait for the toilet finally crumbled, she began to sob. I felt sadness many times in the care home but that totally avoidable loss of dignity was the first time I felt anger. Our investigation was sparked by an interview with Susan Christie, whose father spent two years in Castlehill, the largest care home in Inverness. It is billed as a luxury home and charges up to £1,800 per week. But Susan had become so concerned by the standard of her father's care that she installed a secret camera in his room - and she was appalled by what she saw. ""He wasn't being washed properly, he was being left in an incontinence pad for in excess of 12 hours, never taken to the toilet, food placed out of reach, spilling hot porridge on himself,"" she told us. ""It was neglect."" The final straw came when a cleaner was filmed restraining the elderly man and violently shaking the bed frame before prodding him with a walking stick. He was later sacked and Susan had nine complaints upheld by the Care Inspectorate. She moved her father out of Castlehill in May. In order to compare Castlehill to the 1,000 other care homes across Scotland, the BBC sent a Freedom of Information request to sector regulator, the Care Inspectorate, to ask which care homes in Scotland had the most complaints upheld against them. Castlehill topped the list with 10 complaints upheld in 2024. We interviewed a further four families who all had stories of similar concerns - but they were all historical. The only way to judge whether this was still going on was to go in and see for ourselves. We went through the rigorous BBC internal processes of asking for permission to secretly film. There was judged to be a significant public interest in evidence-gathering of this nature. Undercover filming shows distressed care home resident In May I found myself phoning the care home to ask if there were any cleaning jobs going. I was invited for an interview and asked to start immediately. At the same time, the home was in special measures due to improvement notices issued by the Care Inspectorate over a range of issues. They were under the spotlight - surely things would improve? What I found was an understaffed home that didn't have the right mix of staff to deal with the basic needs of residents, particularly those with dementia. This was leading to distress, aggressive behaviour and crisis situations. As I wheeled my cleaning trolley round the corridors, I was acutely aware of pleading faces peering out of bedrooms, hoping for a few minutes of company and conversation. Those people, at least, still hoped for a moment of human connection. I came to realise others had given up. Castlehil is the largest care home in Inverness and charges up to £1,800 per week One day I reassured a man who needed the toilet: ""I've told the carers, they say they're coming."" ""Aye, so is Christmas,"" he replied. Of all the things I tried to prepare for before going undercover I hadn't anticipated forming genuine bonds with the people who lived in there. The reality of this hit me one day while I sat in my car on a break and I was overwhelmed with emotion. Earlier, while cleaning one resident's room, I found myself retching because of the smell, unable to stay for longer than 20 seconds. The once-proud Highland gentleman whose room it was had been served his breakfast and had spent hours sitting alone in there. Nobody had thought to open his curtains or windows. At least I could walk out of there at the end of my shift. They couldn't. Catriona often found residents lying in wet clothes or on soiled sheets During my time in the home, I often found residents lying in wet clothes or on soiled sheets. I heard women screaming from behind closed doors because male carers were doing their intimate care. The impact of overstretched staff was clear. They had had a tick list of tasks to complete and often that was too long to include meaningful engagement, support with eating or unhurried continence care. There were some carers who strove to make the lives of residents better and who managed to carve out time in their busy days to engage but those moments were few and far between. Carers were paid £13 an hour to do intimate personal care, and much more, for people with very complex needs. This is in line with industry standards. I interviewed Donald McAskill of Scottish Care for the BBC Disclosure investigation. One of his quotes has stuck with me. ""You can get more for walking a dog through the meadows of Edinburgh than you can from sitting at somebody's bedside, holding their hand as they breathe their last,"" he said. ""For me, I find that obscene."" Staff often did not have time to spend time with residents The experts we interviewed were unanimous on one issue. They said the care sector is in crisis. They cited underfunding, staff shortages and unprecedented cuts to frontline dementia support services. With a backdrop of rising demand for care - the number of people with dementia is predicted to double by 2040 - all of the expert contributors in our film called for a nationwide conversation on the future of the sector. Families often told me that they had no option but to place their loved ones in a care home. It hadn't really been a choice, it was the result of a crisis or a lack of care support at home. The guilt weighed heavily on them, as did the burden of the complex financial arrangements that come with care homes. It's a situation that has, or will, touch most families at some point. Pools of urine on a care home corridor The job was not all doom and gloom. In my final week, a new activity leader began staging music concerts and playing the mandolin in the lounges, to the great joy of some residents. A new deputy manager also set her mind to the task of tackling the smell of urine that permeated the first floor. The residents were the unexpected highlight who kept me going when I found it hard to keep walking back through the front doors of Castlehill. One man stopped me in the corridor to tell me about his volunteering work and how much he enjoyed this time helping others. As we laughed about the situations he'd found himself in, he suddenly cut the conversation short. He said his bus was due any minute and he didn't want to miss it. It dawned on me that he thought we were two strangers chatting at the bus stop. Despite that not being the case, we both took joy from that human connection. I learned that with a few minutes of your time, you could encourage someone out of their shell or ease their confusion. That was all it took for them to walk away with a smile, or at least calmer than when they first approached you. Catriona said residents just wanted a human connection When I worked in the home I wore a secret camera, which was recording for most of the time. I worried that someone might spot the hidden lens, or the battery would fall out of my clothes. Luckily neither of those things happened. On one occasion I forgot to wear the fake glasses I had adopted as a partial disguise. I'm from the Highlands and was worried that someone from my home town would come into the home and recognise me, so the disguise gave me a small reassurance. Half way through a staff meeting, someone asked how I could see properly without my glasses on today? I bumbled my way through an explanation of not having had my coffee yet and leaving them in the car by mistake. It was a sloppy mistake that I didn't repeat. There were days when the camera failed, or the battery ran out. There were other days when I had to help the residents first and foremost, and was not able to switch the camera on. I was clear on one thing from the outset - my priority had to be the residents and their needs. That was the whole point of the investigation. Filming was secondary. There were some incidents of poor care that I did not record on camera but I left with a clear conscience. It was a privilege of this role to briefly cross paths with interesting, funny and charming characters, who led rich and colourful lives. We sang songs together, danced in the corridor, hugged, discussed all manner of topics - from Caravaggio and Gaelic lessons to Donald Trump and dog walking - and laughed, lots. Without realising it, the residents kept me going through a difficult job. I left Castlehill Care Home on 9 August. As I walked out the doors for the final time, one question repeated in my mind - surely they deserve better? A spokesperson for Castlehill Care Home, which trades under the name Simply Inverness, said: ""We are appalled by the footage aired in the BBC programme. ""It was not provided to us in advance and does not reflect the situation today. ""The safety, health and wellbeing of residents remains our absolute priority at all times. ""The Care Inspectorate has recognised the significant improvements made in the last three months. ""We must ensure that these improvements are sustained. ""In excess of £1m is being invested in the refurbishment of the home and we thank all residents and their families for their patience during the renovations."" A spokesperson for the Highland Health and Social Care Partnership said: ""The content of the BBC Disclosure documentary about Castlehill Care Home which highlighted issues about delivery of safe, quality care was concerning for all to see, and we understand how deeply distressing this will have been for families of those residents. ""We have a responsibility as a key partner with regards to support and protection of adults and we have clear expectations of standards to be met by any care home provider in Highland. ""The provider of Castlehill care home did not meet those standards. ""At this time care home admissions remain suspended and will continue until we are absolutely confident that the required standards have been met and sustained.""

a43129f4ee5d,Covid cases rising with new variants Nimbus and Stratus,,"Covid cases rising with new variants Nimbus and Stratus Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Getty Images If you feel unwell with a bad throat and a temperature you may well have caught one of the new strains of Covid circulating this autumn. XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus, are now the most common variants being passed around in the UK, according to officials . Experts say these do not appear to pose any bigger threat than previous types of Covid or make people feel more ill. But recent genetic changes the virus has acquired may make infections more likely. Have you got a razor blade sore throat? It is usual for viruses to evolve as they spread between people over time. When the changes become significantly different, the new virus types are known as variants. According to some reports , there may be tell-tale symptoms with the latest ones - a hoarse voice or a ""razor blade"" sore throat. Covid can still cause a wide range of symptoms, including headache, coughing, a blocked or running nose and exhaustion, making it difficult to distinguish from a cold or flu. If you think you have Covid you should avoid contact with vulnerable people and stay at home if possible. If you have symptoms and need to leave the house, advice remains that you should wear a face covering. Washing hands regularly and using and disposing tissues in bins can reduce the spread of this and other respiratory illnesses. For a sore throat, drinking plenty of fluids and having a teaspoon of honey may help, the NHS says. According to the Royal College of GPs, rates of Covid are now increasing across the UK , especially in the very young and elderly. Hospital admissions linked to Covid are also going up. Can I still get a Covid test or vaccine? People over 75 can get a free vaccine against Covid on the NHS. This can offer good protection, even against the new variants, says the UK Health Security Agency  (UKHSA). It is urging people to book their vaccinations against flu and another common winter virus called RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) as cases start to increase ahead of winter. ""It's normal for viruses to mutate and change, and as more data becomes available on these variants,  we'll have a better understanding of how they interact with our immune systems and how to optimise our protection, as well as actions we can take to keep the most vulnerable safe and live our lives as normally as possible,"" says the UKHSA. ""The most important thing is for those eligible to get their vaccination when it is due."" Dr Alex Allen, Consultant Epidemiologist at UKHSA, added: ""Based on the available information so far, there is no evidence to suggest that the variants cause more severe disease or that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against them."" Bear in mind though it is possible to catch Covid again even if you have had it very recently, or have been vaccinated. Reinfections are usually mild, but you can feel unwell and still spread the virus to others. Covid tests are no longer widely available for free, but pharmacies still sell them. A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell Covid vaccines too. The cost varies, with some charging around £99 for a single dose.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/01e0/live/b42d7b30-9e05-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-30T11:58:13.671000+00:00,3fd73a227af4e11776c18eeb8b3c607801dece67
460166ca2650,British veterans with hearing loss start legal battle over 'faulty' earplugs,,"British veterans with hearing loss start legal battle over 'faulty' earplugs Watch: Veterans speak to the BBC about the impact hearing loss has had on their lives Thousands of British military personnel have started legal action after being given ear protection they say was faulty and led to life-changing injuries such as tinnitus and deafness. The US industrial giant 3M supplied the Ministry of Defence (MoD) with the lightweight combat earplugs for use while training and on active service in Afghanistan and other countries. In 2023, the company agreed to pay out $6bn (£4.5bn) to settle similar claims from 240,000 US servicemen and women. 3M said that was not an admission of liability, its product worked effectively if used properly and it was prepared to defend itself in the English courts. Former Guardsman Dave Watson from Worcestershire remembers being given 3M earplugs while serving with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards from 2007, including on tour in Afghanistan. ""Anywhere outside of Camp Bastion we could have been using them, sometimes for up to 12 hours a day,"" he says. Mr Watson, 38, lost both legs and an arm in an explosion while on patrol in Helmand Province in May 2010, leading to his immediate medical discharge from the Army. He has since won five medals at the Invictus Games and now works as a motivational speaker and for veterans' charities. He says he first noticed something was wrong with his hearing around 18 months ago. ""I'd wake up in the early hours of the morning with a ringing in my ears, but I get it all through the day now,"" he says. ""I can't hear when my kids are calling me, I can't hear when my wife is calling me, so it's had a big impact on my family life."" Last month he went for tests and was told he would need hearing aids in the future, he says. Deafness and damage The combat earplugs v2 were reversable with the yellow end allowing some sounds through, and the green designed to block out more noise. Thousands of UK veterans and serving military personnel are now bringing a separate legal case against 3M for supplying what they say were faulty ear protectors between 2003 and at least 2015, when they were replaced by a new model. Its combat arms earplugs (version 2) were designed to be reversible, with one side blocking out most sounds, and the other protecting against impact sounds such as explosions while letting in spoken commands and other quieter noises. In 2018 the company paid $9.1m (£6.8m) to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice which alleged the company knew the earplugs were too short and could ""loosen imperceptibly"". Five years later, in August 2023, it agreed to a $6bn (£4.5bn) settlement to resolve 240,000 civil cases being brought by US military veterans and those still serving. Around $2.75bn (£2bn) has been paid out to date, according to the Lawsuit Information Centre, but 3M has never accepted legal liability, arguing that its products were always ""safe and effective"" if used correctly. This week the first formal legal claim was launched in the UK with a ""letter before action"" sent to 3M on behalf of more than 2,000 veterans and current military personnel. ""As yet, there's been no justice and no compensation for British servicemen and women,"" says Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, which is bringing the case. ""We've got very strong evidence that this product was defective, [and] that it suffered from a design flaw, which is well-documented in some of the cases that have already proceeded in the US."" A spokesman for 3M said the company had ""great respect"" for the British Armed Forces and it took the allegations concerning the product seriously. ""The resolution of previous litigation in the US did not involve any admission of liability and 3M is prepared to defend itself in any litigation threatened in the English courts,"" he said. Carole Timone Carol Timone served in Afghanistan with the British army in 2012 Carol Timone, 33, says she used the earplugs while serving in the British Army between 2008 and 2014, including in Afghanistan in 2012. The former lance bombardier says she's been left with hearing loss on one side from her time in the military and tinnitus which she describes as a ""horrific whining or pulsing that just won't go away"". ""I've seen veterans failed so many times, and this is just another blow to them, so I feel like something needs to be done, and someone really does need to be held accountable for it,"" she says. Earlier this month the Conservative MP Neil Shastri-Hurst called in parliament for an independent inquiry into the extent of hearing loss linked to the earplugs and other potentially defective equipment. The MoD declined to comment on the case against 3M but a spokesman said the government takes the health of its serving personnel seriously. ""We always look at how we can reduce noise levels in their working environment [and] provide training, protective equipment and regular hearing tests,"" he said. ""The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme [also] provides no-fault compensation to service personnel and veterans for injuries, illness and death caused by service.""

2e1001ccff88,Major failings found after surgeon harmed women,,"Major failings found after surgeon harmed women Facebook Daniel Hay was a consultant gynaecologist at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Trust A former NHS gynaecologist's risky practices and shortcuts contributed to women suffering severe physical harm, a long-awaited report into his care has found. Daniel Hay joined the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB) NHS Foundation Trust in 2005, and operated on hundreds of women before retiring in 2020. A report - which scrutinised Mr Hay's care between 2015 and 2018 - was commissioned after concerns were raised by colleagues, and found failings in his practices, how he was managed and added only ""good fortune prevented further harm"". After publication of the report on Wednesday, the NHS trust said it was ""truly sorry"" to the women who received care ""below the standards expected"". The report was commissioned by the Gynaecology Review Steering Group, which included representations from NHS England, UHDB, and the Derby and Derbyshire clinical commissioning group. As part of the report, the panel contacted 325 women who had been treated by Mr Hay between 2015 and 2018, asking them to share their experiences. In addition to the 325 patients, 58 women had already been reviewed in an earlier assessment carried out in 2019. In Wednesday's report, the steering group panel identified two women as suffering ""severe physical harm"", with three sustaining ""moderate physical harm"" under Mr Hay's care. Among the issues identified were women who had a hysterectomy - a surgical procedure that removes the womb - with some patients made to feel like it was their ""only option"" when less invasive options may have been available. This ""adversely affected"" the mental health of women who dreamed of starting families but were unable to do so, affecting their relationships and jobs. Mr Hay relinquished his medical licence in July 2021, having retired citing mental health concerns in July 2020 The report also found Mr Hay ""demonstrated poor clinical practice"", ""failed to recognise possible risks"", while the NHS trust that employed him ""somehow allowed this to continue until he eventually retired due to ill health"". His consent processes - in which patients should be able to make informed decisions over surgery - were poor, his record-keeping was inadequate, and his communication with patients was often dismissive, the report added. Concerns about Mr Hay were raised by consultants, theatre staff and managers as early as 2017-18, but the panel said it was ""surprised"" those staff members were not interviewed by the trust until 2022 - some five years later. What did Mr Hay's patients tell the review? The report published multiple testimonies from women, who were not named. They described being rushed into having hysterectomies. One woman was being treated by Mr Hay for heavy menstrual bleeding, and was offered a hysterectomy after a 10-minute consultation with no scan or alternatives discussed, the report said. She said the surgery left her in pain, suffering anxiety and depression Another woman felt she was not given any option other than to have a hysterectomy - even though there was no examination or scan investigation. She said: ""Was such a drastic major operation the only option I had?"" One woman found Mr Hay to be ""erratic"". She told the panel: ""I remember Mr Hay asking, 'what do you want?' 'I just want the bleeding to stop' was my reply. He immediately got his diary out and told me 'you can have a hysterectomy in April' One patient asked why she had to have an open hysterectomy, rather than via a keyhole approach, and was astounded when Mr Hay answered ""I like slicing"", the report said Meanwhile, another patient added: ""I will never set foot in an NHS hospital again. If my leg were hanging off, I would amputate it myself."" PA Media Following publication of the report, the trust said it had already made ""important changes"" Of the 325 women whose care was scrutinised, the panel graded each case red - for major concerns - amber for some concerns, or green - in which none were identified. In total, 48 cases were rated red, 68 amber and 209 green, though the review did not define the exact nature of the concerns. The panel found it was only because of ""the support of good colleagues"" and good fortune"" that further harm was prevented from being caused. Mr Hay, who is in his 60s and from Alfreton in Derbyshire, is currently being investigated by Derbyshire Police and was interviewed under caution earlier this year . He spoke to officers about the procedures he carried out at Royal Derby Hospital and Ripley Hospital. A police spokesperson said: ""Due to the complex nature of the case, inquiries have taken time, however, throughout the investigation we have remained in close contact with those affected and will continue to do so as the investigation continues."" Mr Hay has not officially commented on the matter for more than four years. His statement in July 2021 said: ""I apologise to the women affected by the NHS investigation. I am co-operating with the investigation, however, due to my ongoing mental health issues, I ask that you please respect my privacy at this time."" The Medical Defence Union, on Mr Hay's behalf, did not wish to comment when approached by the BBC. Following the report, a series of recommendations were made to the trust, including introducing measures to ""identify poorly performing clinicians"", that no consultant should work in isolation, and that attending multidisciplinary team meetings should be mandatory for clinicians. It also called on the trust to invest in more gynaecological support for women under its care. Another recommendation was for the trust to review Mr Hay's care of women before 2015, which has now been accepted with the aim of starting in the autumn. Once ready, the trust will contact women who fall within the scope of the ""Phase 2"" review to invite them to take part. 'Important changes' A second report, which reviewed governance at the UHDB trust at the time, was published alongside the major review into Mr Hay's care. It said Mr Hay's care from 2012 should also be reviewed. Dr Gis Robinson, executive chief medical officer at the NHS trust, said: ""We want to reiterate our unreserved apologies to the women who received care from Mr Hay that was far below the standards expected. ""Following the report we made important changes, with clearer consent procedures and enhanced clinical oversight so any issues with care can be identified more quickly, and improved post-procedure reviews for women. ""We will continue to closely monitor and review these to ensure they are effective and fully integrated, and use our learning to support and inform the next stage of the review."" Getty Images A number of women said they felt as though they had ""no other option"" than to have a hysterectomy Analysis By Rob Sissons, East Midlands health correspondent The report is full of numbers but, of course, behind the numbers are the real lives of women who say their relationships have been ruined through poor care. I have spoken to two women involved in the review who, to some extent, blame themselves for going along with what Mr Hay said. Both felt dismissed and not listened to, but of course, they put their trust in a surgeon in one of the most personal and sensitive areas of medicine, gynaecology. In large organisations - the NHS is the country's biggest employer - things will go wrong, but the question is always are the systems and processes in place robust enough to pick up poor performance, and do management do enough when problems are exposed and colleagues speak out? In the Hay case, it is now apparent more could and should have been done. More cases are now going to be reviewed.

0ccd803fb0f2,Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time,,"Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time James Gallagher Health and science correspondent OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks US scientists have, for the first time, made early-stage human embryos by manipulating DNA taken from people's skin cells and then fertilising it with sperm. The technique could overcome infertility due to old age or disease, by using almost any cell in the body as the starting point for life. It could even allow same-sex couples to have a genetically related child. The method requires significant refinement - which could take a decade - before a fertility clinic could even consider using it. Experts said it was an impressive breakthrough, but there needed to be an open discussion with the public about what science was making possible. Reproduction used to be a simple story of man's sperm meets woman's egg. They fuse to make an embryo, and nine months later a baby is born. Now scientists are changing the rules. This latest experiment starts with human skin. The Oregon Health and Science University research team's technique takes the nucleus – which houses a copy of the entire genetic code needed to build the body – out of a skin cell. This is then placed inside a donor egg that has been stripped of its genetic instructions. So far, the technique is like the one used to create Dolly the Sheep – the world's first cloned mammal – born back in 1996. OHSU The big circle is the egg viewed under a microscope, the white dot at the bottom is the genetic material taken from a skin cell and placed inside However, this egg is not ready to be fertilised by sperm as it already contains a full suite of chromosomes. You inherit 23 of these bundles of DNA from each of your parents for a total of 46, which the egg already has. So the next stage is to persuade the egg to discard half of its chromosomes in a process the researchers have termed ""mitomeiosis"" (the word is a fusion of mitosis and meiosis, the two ways cells divide). An explanation of how the new technique works The study, published in the journal Nature Communications , showed 82 functional eggs were made. These were fertilised with sperm and some progressed onto the early stages of embryos development. None were developed beyond the six-day-stage. ""We achieved something that was thought to be impossible,"" said Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the director of the Oregon Health and Science University's centre for embryonic cell and gene therapy. The technique is far from polished as the egg randomly chooses which chromosomes to discard. It needs to end up with one of each of the 23 types to prevent disease, but ends up with two of some and none of others. There is also a poor success rate (around 9%) and the chromosomes miss an important process where they rearrange their DNA, called crossing over. Prof Mitalipov, a world-renowned pioneer in the field, told me: ""We have to perfect it. ""Eventually, I think that's where the future will go because there are more and more patients that cannot have children."" OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov This technology is part of a growing field aiming to make sperm and eggs outside of the body, known as in vitro gametogenesis. The approach is still at the level of scientific discovery rather than clinical use, but the vision is to help couples who cannot benefit from IVF (in vitro fertilisation) because they don't have the sperm or eggs to use. It could help older women who no longer have viable eggs, men who don't produce enough sperm or people whose cancer treatment has left them infertile. The field also re-writes the rules of parenthood. The technique described today does not have to use a woman's skin cells - it could also use a man's. That opens the door to same-sex couples having children that are genetically related to both partners. For example, in a male same-sex couple, one man's skin could be used to make the egg and a male partner's sperm used to fertilise it. ""In addition to offering hope for millions of people with infertility due to lack of eggs or sperm, this method would allow for the possibility of same-sex couples to have a child genetically related to both partners,"" said Prof Paula Amato, from Oregon Health and Science University. Build public trust Roger Sturmey, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Hull, said the science was ""important"" and ""impressive"". He added: ""At the same time, such research reinforces the importance of continued open dialogue with the public about new advances in reproductive research. ""Breakthroughs such as this impress upon us the need for robust governance, to ensure accountability and build public trust."" Prof Richard Anderson, deputy director of MRC Centre for reproductive health at the University of Edinburgh, said the ability to generate new eggs ""would be a major advance"". He said: ""There will be very important safety concerns but this study is a step towards helping many women have their own genetic children.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2vyee0zlo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/19ca/live/e7051760-9dd9-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T15:01:42.344000+00:00,8a86e184e35036c8961e887dd36cc2435d4133ab
d9523a1e16ff,Streeting rules out VAT on private healthcare,,"Streeting rules out VAT on private healthcare Joshua Nevett Political reporter PA Media Wes Streeting has ruled out introducing value added tax (VAT) on private healthcare at the forthcoming Budget. It comes after newspaper reports that the Treasury was looking at bringing private healthcare services within scope of the sales tax. But asked whether this was under consideration, the health secretary told BBC Breakfast: ""it's not happening"". It comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces repeated questions about the prospect of tax rises, including VAT, when she delivers her budget in November. Economists have said taxes will have to go up in the autumn Budget if the chancellor is to meet her self-imposed rules on borrowing to fund public services. In her Labour conference speech on Monday, Reeves said the government was facing difficult choices and promised she would not take risks with the public finances. The chancellor pledged to keep ""taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible"". But hinting at further tax rises, she said the government's choices had been made ""harder"" by international events and the ""long-term damage"" done to the economy. Labour pledged in its election manifesto not to raise VAT, along with National Insurance, or the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax. But newspaper reports have suggested officials at the Treasury are examining broadening the scope of VAT to help raise further revenue. VAT is levied at a standard rate of 20% on most goods and services in the UK, unless they are classed as reduced or zero-rated. Most private healthcare services are currently exempt from VAT, apart from some procedures which are classified as being primarily cosmetic. Private school fees were also previously exempt, but the government introduced VAT on school fees in January, estimating it could raise £1.7bn a year by 2029/30. In an interview ahead of her conference speech, Reeves was asked if VAT could rise and she said: ""The manifesto commitments stand."" That form of words has been echoed by senior ministers at Labour's conference, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. But when pressed over whether she would have to put up taxes, Reeves said ""the world has changed"" in the last year - pointing to wars in Europe and the Middle East, US tariffs and the global cost of borrowing. ""We're not immune to any of those things,"" she added. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has called for Reeves to put VAT on private healthcare to raise money for the NHS. The Labour peer told the i newspaper removing the VAT exemption on private healthcare would provide ""vital funding"" for public services and be ""widely supported"" by the public. The policy is supported by the Good Growth Foundation think tank, which estimates putting VAT on private acute healthcare could raise more than £2bn. The high cost of long-term government borrowing and weak economic growth has fuelled speculation the chancellor will need to increase taxes. Last month, an independent think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), estimated that the chancellor would need to plug a £50bn gap in the public finances. But the chancellor played down the figure and criticised such forecasters, saying ""a lot of them are talking rubbish"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0knr2dmn4mo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d9c1/live/76de5a00-9dcf-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T07:53:57.183000+00:00,ca206a56129dd435f72a08b0c95a720e20ff4e29
d2479b6bc139,Nurses and pharmacists endangering patients by supplying illegal Botox,,"Nurses and pharmacists endangering patients by supplying illegal Botox Guy Lynn BBC Investigations, London BBC A bogus doctor, a pharmacist and a nurse were all secretly filmed breaking the rules for cash Nurses and pharmacists have been putting patients at risk by supplying Botox without proper checks, a BBC undercover investigation has found. Researchers posing as beauticians secretly filmed a nurse trading prescriptions over WhatsApp, a pharmacist coaching clients to falsify records and a bogus doctor handing over Korean toxin vials for cash. Medical rules require an in-person consultation and prescription to check Botox is suitable. Skipping these safeguards raises the risk of complications such as drooping eyelids, headaches or, in rare cases, respiratory failure or death. The pharmacists' regulator said it was ""very concerned"" while the nurses' regulator said it would review the evidence. Watch: BBC confronts fake doctor selling unlicensed Korean toxins Botulinum toxin - commonly known by the brand name Botox - is also sold under several other licensed brands in the UK, including Azzalure, Bocouture and Dysport. According to market analysts Precision Business Insights, the UK botulinum toxin market was worth about £115m in 2024 and is forecast to reach nearly £295m by 2031. Botox is a prescription-only medicine, and while many people now receive injections from high-street beauticians, the law requires a doctor, dentist, nurse prescriber or pharmacist prescriber to first examine the patient in person and issue a prescription confirming it is safe to proceed. Over several months, BBC researchers gathered evidence of trusted medical professionals sidestepping the rules. Secret recording captured transactions from high-street clinics to online sellers, revealing how unsafe and illegal practices have spread across England's booming aesthetics market. 'Same old crap' Nurse prescriber Sally Jackson was filmed offering to sell Botox prescriptions over WhatsApp without ever seeing patients In a café in Christchurch, Dorset, our undercover researcher posed as a beautician seeking prescriptions and the Botox stock needed to inject clients at a new beauty clinic. Across the table sat Poole-based senior nurse prescriber Sally Jackson, who ran a business supplying beauticians in this way. As a prescriber, she was required under professional rules to meet and examine each patient in person before issuing a prescription, the document that allows beauticians on the high street to inject. Ms Jackson acknowledged those rules but then brushed them aside. ""I'm supposed to do a face-to-face consultation. But we can do it the other way, WhatsApp me,"" she said. When pressed on whether she should speak to clients who would be her patients, to whom she owed a duty of care, she was blunter still. ""I should talk to them, but I won't,"" she admitted, dismissing the checks as ""same old crap"". For £30, she issued a prescription, later obtained by the BBC from the pharmacy she directed, for a patient she had never met, whose details were sent to her on WhatsApp. Once a private practitioner in London's exclusive Harley Street, Ms Jackson was now selling shortcuts to beauticians nationwide, telling our researcher: ""I'm so busy."" She also offered to prescribe extra vials on a genuine patient's script - allowing beauticians to keep stock for clients and then inject them secretly, with no prescription in place. Prescribing a drug in one person's name for use on another constitutes fraud. Ms Jackson ignored repeated requests for comment. When confronted in person, she replied: ""I am not interested."" Patients have reported harm after Botox injections - the BBC investigation found rules designed to prevent such injuries were being bypassed by registered medical professionals ""Botox is safe when used properly - but the checks exist for a reason,"" said Cheryl Barton, lead nurse at the Aesthetika clinic near Sheffield, who often gives expert evidence in malpractice cases. ""The truth is that shortcuts by registered and regulated medical professionals who should know better are an open secret in the industry. Prescribers are supposed to see patients face to face and issue a valid prescription - but too often they don't."" Without those safeguards, explained Barton, prescribers can miss vital conditions that make treatment unsafe, or channel counterfeit and unlicensed products on to the market. Misuse of botulinum toxin can cause serious harm - from headaches and blurred vision to, in rare cases, respiratory failure or even death. Official figures back up her concerns. The UK medicines regulator recorded 52 suspected Botox-related complications in 2019, rising to 225 in 2024, with 141 already logged this year. Since 2015, 12 deaths have been recorded. For patients such as Antonia Hannah, from Twickenham, west London, the impact can be devastating. She booked Botox as a birthday treat, but the qualified practitioner gave her no proper consultation, asked no questions about her medical history and failed to assess whether the treatment was suitable. Within days her eyelid had drooped and swelled. ""It was constant discomfort and pain, like glass in your eyes,"" she said. ""I'd be out shopping with my daughter, glance in a mirror, and just burst into tears."" 'You're going to do it illegally' Pharmacist Cornelius Agoye was filmed in his Rainham pharmacy handing over Botox for cash In east London, pharmacist prescriber Cornelius Agoye was also willing to prescribe without any consultation, handing over vials of Botox for cash with no patient in sight. He met a second undercover researcher, posing as a beautician wanting prescriptions and stock for clients, and to cover his tracks told us to fill in records as if a consultation had taken place: ""I did face-to-face consultation today… I've just done it,"" he said. He then explained to us the same fraudulent practice of using prescriptions for one patient to obtain extra stock to be used on others. Asked about the legality of this, his answer was blunt: ""Yeah, you're going to do it illegally… That's what you're doing. I didn't tell you anything."" The BBC wrote to Mr Agoye, a registered and trusted community pharmacist, seeking an explanation for his behaviour. He apologised and admitted falling below professional standards and said he meant no harm. These Botox vials were supplied illegally by pharmacist Cornelius Agoye, who told an undercover reporter to falsify records and use the medicine without prescriptions for patients Earlier this year, a sudden outbreak of botulism across England left dozens of young women in hospital, some partially paralysed, after being injected with black-market Korean toxin sold by beauticians as a Botox-style treatment. It highlighted the dangers of unlicensed products — and led the BBC to investigate those behind the trade in London. The team uncovered a bogus doctor selling unlicensed Botox. In north London, Prakash Gurnani — who runs Beauty Aesthetics and Wellbeing in Golders Green — introduced himself to our undercover researcher as a ""skin doctor"". In reality he is not a doctor at all, and misleading clients in this way is a criminal offence. When asked about Botox, he immediately offered a cheaper Korean alternative. The Korean vials were unlicensed botulinum toxin products, marketed as having the same wrinkle-smoothing effect. They're potentially dangerous because they aren't regulated or tested in the UK, so their contents and safety, or whether they are counterfeit, are unknown. He sold a vial for £149, with no prescription and no safeguards, and admitted he had been trading unlicensed products for years across the UK including throughout the Covid period. 'They are young girls and there's no problem' Prakash Gurnani, who illegally calls himself a ""skin doctor"", was filmed taking cash while supplying unlicensed Korean toxins Mr Gurnani described holding Botox parties where groups of young women were injected with the same illegal Korean toxin. He told our researcher to hide what was really being injected. ""Just say 'tox',"" he instructed. ""Don't use 'Botox', just say 'anti-wrinkle'. Keep it quiet. They are young girls and there's no problem - just treat them with Korean tox."" When asked about the risks by the researcher, he brushed them aside. ""Very safe. As long as they don't open their mouth,"" he said, referring not to any medical issue, but to the risk of being caught. A vial of unlicensed Korean botulinum toxin sold to the BBC by Prakash Gurnani. Unlike licensed Botox, it has not been safety checked and is not traceable His activities stretched beyond Botox. He also sold the BBC powerful prescription-only weight-loss drugs such as Mounjaro, despite not being qualified to prescribe them, and even suggested injecting one of our reporters with an illegally obtained anaesthetic as part of a cosmetic procedure. The BBC had only given him the scantest of details, and a pharmacy which issued the prescription and supplied the weight loss drugs said he had tricked them by posing as a doctor — a claim Mr Gurnani later disputed. Mr Gurnani ignored all requests for comment, and when confronted by the BBC denied offering Botox illegally or asking clients to break the law. Prakash Gurnani was secretly recorded explaining how to hide the use of unlicensed Korean toxin and mislead young women about what they were being injected with The cases of Sally Jackson, Cornelius Agoye and Prakash Gurnani were not isolated. The BBC received reports from other parts of England of registered medical professionals breaking the rules, and some of them spoke directly to our undercover researcher. One pharmacist also admitted he was not carrying out the required face-to-face consultations and suggested faking photographs to trick regulators into thinking they had taken place. Another nurse was found issuing prescriptions on the basis of the barest patient details, and, after the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) tightened its guidelines in June, admitted she was prepared to ""be a bit greyer"" and carry on without proper consultations. Medical experts told the BBC such practices stripped away the most basic safeguards and put large numbers of patients at risk. Beyond those caught on camera, the BBC uncovered extensive evidence of other nurses and pharmacists supplying Botox illegally The BBC wrote to the NMC, which regulates nurses across the UK. It said prescribers must see patients face to face before issuing prescriptions for cosmetic procedures, and promised to review the evidence from this investigation and act on breaches. The BBC also approached the General Pharmaceutical Council. It said it was ""very concerned"" by the findings, stressing that Botox prescriptions always require a physical examination and that enforcement action would follow where standards were not met. The BBC further asked the Department of Health and Social Care about the issues raised. It said the cosmetics industry had long been plagued by unlicensed practitioners and confirmed the government was assessing reforms, including tougher licensing of non-medical professionals such as beauticians. But when repeatedly asked about the central finding of this investigation - that trusted medical professionals are themselves breaking the rules and putting patients at risk - the department did not offer a response and declined an interview with Health Secretary Wes Streeting.

There are now 65 inquests ongoing into the deaths of patients of Ian Paterson, who was convicted of wounding patients with botched and unnecessary operations in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mr Foster said: ""I have reason to believe Mrs Brown and Ms Fox's deaths were caused by or contributed to by substandard care provided by Ian Paterson and have reason to suspect their deaths were unnatural.""

5e3e7c1d8e11,Collagen: Do you drink it? Inject it? Rub it on your skin? And does it work?,,"Collagen: Do you drink it? Inject it? Rub it on your skin? And does it work? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images When it comes to collagen - how do you take yours? There are parties where people even drink shots of the anti-ageing supplement, often followed by a hefty tequila - though the latter is probably not recommended in the quest for youthful, peachy skin. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and forms the scaffolding that helps maintain the structural integrity of our skin and musculoskeletal system. In short, collagen helps to keep our skin plump, our joints and bones strong, and our hair and nails healthy. It's become so treasured that some dermatologists recommend ""banking"" it - investing in our collagen supply early so we have surplus when the inevitable happens. Yes. The inevitable. Ageing. Sigh. Our collagen supply naturally starts to decrease, on average around 1% a year, as we reach our mid to late 20s . The speed of its decline depends on factors like our exposure to the sun, diet, and stress levels. But is there credible science to say supplements can replenish our dwindling supply? And if so, what's the best way of getting it into our bodies? Kimberlie Smith As a sleep deprived mother, Kimberlie says collagen makes a difference to her skin Kimberlie Smith started taking collagen about six months ago. The 33-year-old began using it after a ""traumatic year"" in 2024. Her son was born prematurely, and as a result of stress, the mother-of-three says her skin took a ""huge hit"". She uses marine collagen, the type derived from fish, in a tropical-flavoured gel she drinks every day. ""My skin definitely seems to be brighter and clearer, plus my hair has never looked better since I started taking it,"" Kimberlie says. ""As a sleep deprived mother, it's definitely made a difference."" Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist based on London's Harley Street, says while there is some research to suggest taking collagen orally has an impact , she remains sceptical. She says the idea that collagen can make its journey through our body - not the easiest of quests - and land exactly where we need it to be is probably wishful thinking. For a start, it has to get through the gut without being completely broken down. Collagen is a large molecule so companies have now started to break it up into smaller pieces - collagen peptides - otherwise known as hydrolysed collagen. Even though this collagen - now in its smaller form - has a better chance of making its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it still has a long way to go. It has to reach the skin to have an impact, and it could just as easily slip off to support other organs in the body. It's a valuable resource. ""There is little reliable evidence on this, but there is a theory that because our skin is the organ with the 'fastest turnover' of cells, it might be more likely to use these collagen peptides above other organs."" And that's when you might get an increase in collagen being made in the skin cells. 'You can't risk stopping' That all seems very complicated - and uncertain. It may leave you asking: what about using collagen creams? They're going directly onto the skin, so won't they stand more chance of getting where they need to be? ""No,"" is Ms Wedgworth's simple answer. ""The collagen will just sit on the outer layer of your skin, it won't reach the dermis - which is the middle layer."" There are three different types of collagen supplements: marine (from fish), bovine (from cows), and vegan. Of the three, the dermatologist recommends marine if you are taking collagen orally. This is because it contains more type 1 collagen - the most common of the five types and the one that gives structure to our skin cells, as well as playing a crucial role in the health of our bones, tendons and connective tissues. Vegan collagen is the least effective, says Ms Wedgeworth. Collagen is an animal-derived protein, so these products are not actually made of collagen, and instead contain a range of amino acids and vitamins. Matthew Montgomery Ali Watson, a keen weightlifter, originally started to use collagen supplements to help protect her joints ""I'm trapped,"" Ali Watson tells me as she points to packs of bovine collagen powder in her kitchen. ""Yes, this one is for me and well, this one is for Tommy."" I look at the slender brown hound next me, grey whiskers poking out round his nose. He lifts an eyebrow in acknowledgement. Ali, a neuroanaesthetist who, by her own admission, ""knows a lot about dosing"", feels like now she's started taking collagen, she can't stop - and nor can she stop giving it to her dog. ""I started taking it as a powder a couple of years ago. At first, it wasn't about my appearance, it was about my joints, I wanted to protect them because I do a lot of weight-lifting."" Ali's not sure that she's noticed any difference with her joints, but she has noticed a change elsewhere. ""My skin feels like it glows more, my hair feels thicker and my nails feel stronger."" I glance down at Tommy, who seems more interested in his dog bowl than any powdered supplements. ""I know, it seems mad,"" Ali says, ""but Tommy seemed a bit slower, a bit less enthusiastic just before summer, so I thought I would try him on dog collagen. ""I wanted to see if it could help with his joints - he's getting old now. And he is a bit brighter, but that might just be because the weather's got colder again and he's less hot and lethargic."" Ali's not completely convinced the supplement is making a difference, and it's costing her £60 a month to ensure she and Tommy get their daily dose. Tommy started on collagen a few months ago to help his joints But she says she now can't stop. ""That's the thing with these supplements,"" the 46-year-old says, ""life does have its ups and downs. You might take them when you're on a down, then things pick up again - and it might have very little to do with the supplements. ""But by that stage, you can't risk stopping."" Professor Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist at Mid Cheshire NHS Trust, says one of the issues consumers and clinicians face is the amount of conflicting information and conflicting interests in supplement research. A recent, relatively small, study compared research funded by the wellness industry to studies that did not have the same conflict of interest. While industry-funded studies suggested collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles, those that did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect on skin. Prof Ali says industry-funded studies are not ""inherently bad"", it's just such a varied picture. But he says there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest oral and topical collagen have any substantial effect. So if I could turn back time and start drinking and banking collagen in my 20s, would I have smoother, more youthful skin now, I ask him? Probably not, he says. It doesn't stay in the body for that long - we haven't got a collagen store cupboard that we can just dip into. Getty Images Microneedling makes small wounds in the skin which may trigger collagen production However, Prof Ali believes we can potentially boost collagen output and maintain elasticity in our skin by using special techniques such as laser collagen stimulation and microneedling . This means using a number of tiny, specialist needles or a laser to make small wounds to our skin, which then encourage a repair process, triggering new collagen formation. But that's not cheap. You could be paying up to £300 for one session. Is there a less costly alternative? ""The best thing you can do for your skin,"" Prof Ali says, ""is using decent sunblock. We know the sun has a huge impact on ageing our skin. ""Sun cream, healthy diet, and if you smoke, stop.

4851f30d3ea6,Doctors' union warning over online booking safety risk,,"Doctors' union warning over online booking safety risk Getty Images There are concerns the new online system will not be able to differentiate between urgent and non-urgent requests The doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), has warned that potentially serious health problems could be missed by GPs, and lead to patients being harmed, when a new online booking system is launched across England on Wednesday. But Health Secretary Wes Streeting says ministers are putting the interests of patients first and had already agreed clear safeguards with the union. The system will allow patients wanting an on-the-day GP appointment, or a call from a clinician, to make a request online throughout the day. The facility is already available in many practices and is designed to reduce long waits on the phone during the so-called '8am scramble'. 'Online tsunami' The BMA says the government must halt the rollout of the online booking plan to allow changes to be put in place. The union argues that online systems cannot distinguish adequately between urgent and non-urgent patient messages, and this could lead to potentially serious cases being delayed. The BMA has also warned there would be a ""potential online triage tsunami"" with no additional workforce to cope with the extra demand. Union leaders say more should be done to provide safeguards, such as allowing practices to temporarily switch off the online booking mechanism if staff are struggling to handle patient numbers. The union has warned that if the government does not amend the scheme, a formal dispute will be declared. This could lead to a ""work to rule"" situation, similar to what was introduced in a previous dispute during which GPs limited patient appointments to the minimum required under their contract. 'NHS should not be held back' But ministers argue that the BMA had agreed to the introduction of online booking as part of a new negotiated contract in England. They point out that many GPs already offer the service. Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was ""absurd"" that in 2025 many patients can't request appointments online. ""If you can book a hair appointment online, you should be able to book an NHS appointment too. We have agreed clear safeguards, where patients will be directed to phone up or attend in person for urgent appointments. The BMA knows this. This government will always put the interests of patients first, and we will not stand for our NHS being held back in the analogue age."" Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GP committee, said the changes were agreed to ""on the condition that 'necessary safeguards' would be put in place"" before Wednesday 1 October. ""This was agreed – in writing – with government… and NHSE in February this year. Now almost eight months later, it is deeply disappointing to see promises broken,"" she added. She said ministers had been warned that the changes would lead to ""hospital-style waiting lists in general practice"" which could ""reduce face-to-face GP appointments"". Mr Streeting said that that 2,000 extra GPs had already been hired across England and that patient satisfaction with their GPs was on the up. Officials said that surgeries which had implemented the changes had reported reduced waiting times for appointments.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje8dljz7eo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/abde/live/2bea5880-9dc2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-09-29T11:35:28.974000+00:00,91e37fa48eb53c9dbced4a1271b15c7ba45a1404

Newborn Molly appeared unsettled, and aged three weeks had three seizures, said mum Corinne Wardle, a community nurse in Flintshire and Wrexham. At eight weeks, Molly's head was bigger than normal, she was unsettled and vomiting frequently, and her eyes would only look right - but the symptoms were dismissed by a paediatrician. But after noticing that Molly's fontanelle - the soft spot on the top of her head - was bulging when she was 12 weeks, a doctor in A&E diagnosed a large brain tumour. ""Her eyes were going in opposite corners and her head suddenly got massive,"" said Corinne, from Flint, speaking more than two years on from the initial surgery. Back at the hospital emergency department, the mum and baby were about to be sent home by staff after being told there was an eight-hour wait. But when another 10-day-old baby came in with a seizure, a doctor was called - he subsequently examined Molly and rushed her straight through. He measured her head and it was ""off the chart"", said Corinne, so the doctor sent her in for a CT scan. ""He wouldn't leave her side. He was fantastic,"" she said. Corinne Wardle Molly relapsed in January this year and had surgery in February The results came through instantly, and Corinne was told Molly had a large mass on her brain. She was sent straight to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool, where she underwent nine hours of surgery the following morning to remove the tumour Baby Molly then had a year of chemotherapy, and took five different types of chemotherapy drugs as part of a clinical trial. One of the  trialled drugs caused her to stop breathing, and she had be put on a ventilator. Molly has suffered hearing loss and global developmental delay - when a child takes longer than expected to reach key developmental milestones such as speaking and walking - as a result of the treatment. She was in remission for two years, but in January this year, two further tumours were found, and she had more surgery. The plan was to follow up with radiotherapy, but because the tumour was half the size of Molly's brain this risks significant cognitive impairment, Corinne said. She told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast : ""She would be disabled for life, always needing support. ""She won't be able to do things like cross the road by herself or use money."" Because of this, the family are holding off on the radiotherapy, and Molly is having three-monthly MRI scans under general anaesthetic as they watch and wait. Corinne Wardle Molly has undergone several complex operations and is now being monitored Hugh Adams, from Brain Tumour Research, said Molly's case was ""uniquely challenging"", adding faster diagnosis was ""something we have to strive for"". He described the interventions and surgery necessary for Molly's survival as ""really tough"", particularly for such young children, pointing out they also carry additional risks. ""Radiotherapy on a developing brain is a really tough option,"" he said - and he highlighted how chemotherapy impacts the entire body before it reaches the brain. He called for more money to be put into research on brain tumours, to hasten research into alternative treatments for the condition. ""We need to be looking at some of the newer things - maybe vaccines, maybe immunotherapy: things that are at the cutting edge of cancer treatment... so that people aren't impaired by their treatment as much as they are by the actual tumour itself,"" he said. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""If we put money into research, we get closure to new cures and options - if we don't, we won't. ""Historically we've put 1% of the national cancer research spending into brain tumours. That isn't enough.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2z5py6l12o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9ef8/live/3fde3150-9dd0-11f0-9f23-2534d63ace40.jpg,2025-09-30T09:52:59.351000+00:00,385c96dcec4d0e6013726f3c5eed4a5d6162ec02
2616da008e15,Can England's rugby heroes inspire more girls to stay in sport?,,"Can England's rugby heroes inspire more girls to stay in sport? Nicola Goodwin BBC Midlands Investigations BBC Sports groups in England are hoping to use the success of the England Women's team to keep youngsters, like these in Worcester, playing their sport A million teenage girls are giving up sport because of deep-rooted negative attitudes - but could the England Women's Rugby World Cup victory change that? I arrive at a sports hall as a group of 11 and 12-year-old girls play netball and laughter is ringing out. Their PE teacher, Liz Brown, says she is passionate about boosting their confidence through games like this and exercise. ""Sport and PE is the vehicle. My real job is to create personalities, confidence and resilience,"" she tells me. As they move the ball around, shoot and practice, the students tell me that playing sport is helping with their mental as well as physical health. One of them, Ellie-May, says: ""It makes me feel happy and it's enjoyable."" These are the kind of teenage girls which a new campaign is targeting, with the hope that England's success in the Women's Rugby World Cup will help stop them dropping out of sport. Research by the charity Women in Sport discovered that a million teenage girls, who enjoyed games at primary school, gave them up after moving on. A fear of feeling judged by others, a lack of confidence and not feeling safe outside were among the negative attitudes behind the decline, cited by the study. Mollie, Ellie-May and Trisha said playing sport made them happy Back at the sports hall, at Perton Middle School in Staffordshire, near Wolverhampton, Ms Brown says she feels girls want to be part of sport. ""They want to be part of a community, they want to get out there and enjoy themselves,"" she tells me. ""If these girls can see it on TV and social media, they understand and they follow, and they will enjoy it."" Among the girls, Valentina and Kiara say: ""It doesn't really matter if you're not good at it because you can always get extra help."" PE teacher Liz Brown said seeing women's sport on TV had inspired her students Ahead of the World Cup, the Red Roses launched a campaign called For the Girls aimed at inspiring women and girls to be more active and confident. ""The social media, the World Cup TV coverage, the TikTok dances and all of that is having a major impact on the students,"" Ms Brown adds. One of the girls in the sports hall, Scarlett, says everyone is good enough at sport and ""it doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, just give it a go and you'll be fine"". Grassroots sport is getting £400m from the government, ministers said in June , to promote health and remove barriers to sport for groups including women and girls. For Stephanie Hilborne, chief executive of Women in Sport, efforts needed to be made to bust a myth ""that teenage girls drop out of sport simply because their priorities change"". ""They're being failed due to early years stereotyping, inadequate opportunities and a complete dearth of knowledge about managing female puberty,"" she added. Worcester's under-16 girls team said the World Cup coverage was inspiring their friends to have a go at rugby The Women's Rugby World Cup has drawn huge crowds, tickets sales have beaten those from the previous tournament and its popularity across the country has been noted by those who play the game. At Worcester Rugby Club, Jessie, who plays for their under-16s team, said the buzz around the tournament had been great. ""I've had my friends from school talk to me about the World Cup who don't even play rugby and we've had about four or five new players this year,"" she said. ""I'd love to be able to play professional rugby. Whatever happens I'll keep on playing, I'll never give it up."" ""I turned on my phone after school today and all I got was rugby social media and I was loving it,"" added Elinor, a flanker in the team. Their team has a strong connection to the Red Roses as they are coached by the first woman to score 60 international tries, former England winger Nicky Crawford, who is also Jessie's mum. ""If you're playing with your friends, then you're more likely to carry on with sport afterwards and you develop lifelong friendships,"" she said. ""The World Cup can get the word out there just how great the world of rugby is, just how accessible it is to everybody and just what fun it is. ""When the Red Roses are scoring the tries and doing the celebrations afterwards, just the smiles on their faces is just rewarding in itself and it inspires girls to say 'I want to do that'."" The success of England's women is something that the Rugby Football Union is looking to build on with data from Sport England showing the number of women and girls playing rugby is rising. They aim to get 100,000 female players of the sport registered by 2027 and are working with the government and other groups on the legacy from this year's World Cup. Funding worth £12.1m has been promised for England and the home unions to create more rugby opportunities for women and girls. Former Red Rose winger Nicola Crawford said playing rugby could lead to girls developing lifelong friendships In 2022, the Worcester club launched what they claimed was the first women's mixed ability team in England and they now hope to start a Midlands and national squad in the future. Their approach offers a safe, welcoming, inclusive space and the age of players ranges from 17 to 57, with those involved choosing to take part in contact or touch rugby. Jennie Hussain said playing in a mixed ability team in Worcester was friendly and supportive Jennie Hussain said she was nervous when she first came to a training session but is now at the club three nights a week. ""I was worried as I wear a hijab and I thought it would get in the way or people would judge me but everybody's been so inviting,"" she said. ""I haven't looked back since."" Elsie-May has been playing a year and said she loved sliding in the mud. Her dad David added: ""The women and the coaches are amazing. There are lots of different standards here but she loves the rugby and the socialising.""

707443b4e242,Dad's frustration over stillbirth report delay,,"Dad's frustration over stillbirth report delay Joanne Writtle Health correspondent, BBC West Midlands Family picture Thomas and Ewa Hender have two children, with the younger receiving the middle name Aubrey, in memory of his late brother A couple whose son was stillborn have criticised health bosses for taking a year and a half to release a report about stillbirth rates in the Black Country. Thomas and Ewa Hender say they asked the Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) to release details in April, when they first became aware of the report. It was actually completed 18 months ago, but it has only recently been released in full - a ""worrying"" delay, Mr Hender said. The report revealed that neonatal deaths and stillbirths across the Black Country have been rising since 2020, with stillbirths rising at a more significant rate. The ICB said the report made recommendations, and progress in maternity care would be monitored. Mr Hender said: ""I think it's worrying that a report regarding perinatal mortality doesn't seem to be very high on the priority list of the ICB if it's taken 18 months to release from completion."" His son Aubrey was stillborn at the former City Hospital in Birmingham in 2022. The Henders said they raised health concerns during the pregnancy, and they believe there were problems with Aubrey's care. The couple are now proud parents to a two-year-old and a three-month-old, the younger of whom has the middle name Aubrey. Family picture Thomas Hender with Aubrey The report looked at all four NHS hospital trusts in the Black Country – Sandwell and West Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall, and Dudley. The areas are among the most deprived in the country. It concentrated on six months from March to September 2023 and found there were 51 stillbirths reported. The review looked at 40 of them. It found 78% of the mums were from deprived areas. In addition, 70% were from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds, with more than half - 50.5% - of a south Asian ethnicity. Fourteen of the women did not speak English as their first language and, the report recorded, interpreting was not used consistently in seven of those cases. Mr Hender said he felt that ""yet again it points to the fact that families from deprived areas and of minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected by poor maternity care. "" But he said the issue also affected people more widely. ""Given the mortality rates, we know that there must be other families out there who like us feel that children's deaths were preventable,"" he said. Sally Roberts, chief nursing officer and deputy chief executive officer for NHS Black Country ICB said: ""Every stillbirth is a devastating loss, our thoughts are with the families who have experienced such unimaginable grief."" She added: ""The report and recommendations have been through robust governance arrangements and shared with maternity units across the Black Country. Those maternity units are now taking action to implement the recommendations and ensure meaningful learning takes place. ""The ICB will continue to monitor progress through the Local Maternity and Neonatal System arrangements in place."" Maternity services moved from City Hospital to the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital last November. It is part of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust which is among 14 currently being scrutinised in a rapid review of maternity services across England. Mel Roberts, chief nursing officer and deputy chief executive officer for the trust said: ""We will continue to work closely with the ICB, our maternity teams, and service-user representatives to implement improvements and to reduce the risk of stillbirth across our communities. ""Most importantly, we remain committed to listening to parents and families, ensuring their experiences drive the changes needed to provide the safest possible care for every pregnancy.""

Like many couples they had never discussed organ donation but she knew it was what he would have wanted. Now Arlene and son Jack, 12, take comfort in the knowledge that Mark has helped transform the lives of others. She said: ""He lives on in four people. That can only be a good thing."" Arlene and Jack, who live near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, hope that their story encourages people to speak about the sensitive subject before it is too late. They also want to raise awareness about strokes. Hutchinson family Arlene described Mark as the love of her life Arlene, 51, who works in marketing, met Mark in 2004. He worked in behavioural health and safety but they did not become a couple until 2007. Arlene described him as the love of her life and they married in New York in 2010. Jack was born two years later and they were soon joined by pet dog, Luna. She recalled: ""We had a really happy life together, the three of us."" Arlene said they had a ""healthy"" family lifestyle. The couple were non-smokers, ate well and enjoyed taking Luna for walks. But last summer their lives were suddenly turned upside down. Jack and Arlene say the company of pet dog Luna makes life easier for them Arlene and Jack took the dog for a walk while Mark was in the shower getting ready for a family event. When they got back, Arlene said Mark was emotional. ""He told me he was not feeling right at all, and had fallen,"" she said. ""He just wasn't himself. And he had a numb tongue."" Mark's speech started to go, and one side of his face drooped - classic stroke symptoms. ""It was very, very distressing,"" she said. They tried to keep him calm while they waited for an ambulance. After arriving in hospital, Arlene was told her husband had a blood clot in the brain but was still conscious and sitting up. She said there was ""fear"" in Mark's eyes, and he was taken to the stroke ward. Over the coming days, the talk was of recovery. But Mark then suffered a second stroke and lost consciousness. Arlene said she ""still had hope"" as they waited for scan results, but they revealed the ""devastating"" news that Mark's brain had been left severely damaged. ""There was not any good outcome,"" she said. ""I knew Mark would never want to be like that - where he just could not do anything for himself. ""I will never have to do anything as hard as tell Jack."" As Arlene came to terms with the news she spoke to the donor team. 'Recipient's life has changed' She said: ""We decided that was what we would like to do. ""Mark was going to die. I felt it was an easy decision for me to make. ""Knowing the person Mark was, I know that he would have wanted this wholeheartedly to help others."" He died two days later, and was taken to theatre. Arlene said: ""The amazing specialist organ donation team stepped in. ""They cared for Mark and my family with so much dignity and respect. ""They were with us during our darkest moments and when Mark passed away. ""The team found four recipients for Mark's organs, and we have amazingly since heard from one recipient whose life has completely changed since gaining two kidneys from Mark."" NHS Grampian Jack and Arlene recently unveiled an organ donor artwork in Aberdeen Arlene and Jack recently unveiled an art installation at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary which pays tribute to organ donors. Artist Shelagh Swanson was commissioned to work with the relatives of donors, along with young people at more than a dozen secondary schools, to create the ripple-effect art. Workshops were held with secondary school pupils across Aberdeen, and in Aberdeenshire in Stonehaven, Kemnay, Huntly, Inverurie and Peterhead. Arlene said she was honoured to unveil the artwork and added: ""I am in awe of what the small but dedicated organ donation team achieve and will be forever grateful to them."" What is the law on organ donation in Scotland? Everyone in Scotland became an automatic organ donor from 2021 under new laws, unless they opt out. Under the previous system, more than half of Scotland's population were registered to donate their organs or tissue after their death. It is now presumed that people have consented to donation unless they have stated otherwise. There are some exemptions, including children under the age of 16, and adults who lack the capacity to understand the new law - for example those with dementia. The aim is that more people can be given life-saving and life-changing transplants. People who do not want their organs to be donated for a transplant can opt out through the Organ Donation Scotland website. Hutchinson family Jack said his dad was ""joyful"" Arlene said her husband ""just wanted to spread joy"". She added: ""He was caring, a big softie. He had a massive smile on his face all the time. He was such a happy man."" Reflecting on his loss, she said: ""We will never know why as it was completely out the blue. ""It's been over a year and every day is hard. All of this has changed our lives."" Jack, now 13, described his dad as ""always upbeat, joyful"". He said: ""He was a lot of fun, always doing silly things to make us laugh.

52da01c4ba3b,"My eating disorder made me good at lying, says Victoria Beckham",,"My eating disorder made me good at lying, says Victoria Beckham Noor Nanji Culture reporter Getty Images Victoria Beckham pictured at the world premiere for her new Netflix documentary in Mayfair, London on Wednesday ""It's not about him, it's about me,"" declares Victoria Beckham (""him"" being her husband Sir David Beckham). And that's exactly what we get in a new three-part documentary, which drops on Netflix on Thursday. The former Spice Girl and fashion entrepreneur, 51, is determined to tell her own story – two years after former England captain Sir David, 50, released his own, hugely successful TV series . In the episodes, Victoria is strikingly open about her eating disorder, and how it made her ""good at lying"". The series also takes us inside Victoria's pop career, family life, struggles to reinvent herself and preparation for a major show at Paris Fashion Week. There are contributions from famous friends including Eva Longoria, and fashion titans such as Dame Anna Wintour and Donatella Versace. Here are our main takeaways from her documentary. Negative headlines about weight Victoria achieved dizzying fame in the Spice Girls, so it's hard to believe that at school, she was ""that uncool kid"" who didn't fit in. ""I was definitely a loner at school"", she says, explaining she was bullied. She says that she first started getting criticised about her appearance and her weight at a young age. And when she joined the Spice Girls in 1994, she regularly faced negative headlines about her weight. Shutterstock ""I was controlling [the narrative] in an incredibly unhealthy way. When you have an eating disorder, you become very good at lying,"" she said. ""And I was never very honest about it with my parents. I never talked about it publicly. It really affects you, when you're being told constantly you're not good enough. And I suppose that's been with me my whole life."" But Lady Beckham says her bandmates Mel B, Mel C, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell made her ""feel more lighthearted, more fun"", and made her ""feel good enough"" about being herself. It's a message she continues to instill in her daughter Harper, 14. ""I tell Harper every day, be who you are,"" she says. What was buried in Baden-Baden? Alamy The WAGS (wives and girlfriends) descended on the spa town of Baden Baden in summer 2006 to support their partners After the release of their chart-topping debut single Wannabe in 1996, ""Spice mania"" swept the planet, with their self-styled ""Girl Power"" mantra - a brand of female empowerment that made them a global pop culture phenomenon. But Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls in 1998 and the group split up in 2001. Lady Beckham says she found the transition ""really, really difficult"". She carried on making music, but the criticism she received ""really hurt"". Then came the infamous WAG period. Pictures of Victoria and other wives-and-girlfriends supporting their footballer partners in the German town of Baden-Baden in 2006 were plastered all over the tabloids. ""It was fun,"" says Lady Beckham of that time in her life. But she now concedes there was an ""element of attention seeking"" to it all. ""I was trying to find myself, I felt incomplete, sad, frozen in time maybe,"" she says. After the family moved to the US, Lady Beckham decided she wanted to work in fashion. But to do that, she knew she had to shed her other personas – the Spice Girl, the WAG. ""I buried those boobs in Baden-Baden,"" she says. Victoria 'almost lost everything' in struggles with fashion business Lady Beckham is very honest about the struggles her fashion business faced. She says people didn't see her as ""cool at all"", and that a lot of people refused to take her seriously. And Vogue giant Dame Anna cements that view, when she says of Victoria's fashion aspirations: ""I thought maybe this was a hobby. I didn't quite believe it."" We see the growth of Victoria Beckham Ltd but also the serious financial troubles it faced. Sir David says he didn't think her business would survive, while Lady Beckham agrees. ""I almost lost everything and that was a dark, dark time,"" she says. ""I used to cry before I went to work every day because I felt like a firefighter."" Getty Images Romeo, Harper and David Beckham were in Paris last week to support Victoria at her fashion week show She says her firm was ""tens of millions in the red"". In a later scene, her voice breaks, and she wells up in tears, when she recalls how Sir David stepped in to help her business out. But the series also shows her turn things around, and we see her pull out all the stops in the run-up to her triumphant Spring/Summer show at Paris Fashion Week in September 2024. Supermodel Gigi Hadid walked for her, wearing a striking emerald green gown. Dame Anna is shown in attendance, and, in an earlier clip, says Lady Beckham ""totally proved us wrong"". Today, Victoria's business has offices in London and New York, with its flagship store in Mayfair, London. The brand's products are in 230 stores across 50 countries around the world, according to the company's website. Family life carries on, amid reports of feud with Brooklyn EPA (Left to right) David, Victoria, Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham at the London premiere of Beckham in 2023 The couple's eldest son, 26-year-old Brooklyn, gets a few mentions in the show and appears briefly. Lady Beckham brings him up in conversation, when discussing the morning sickness she faced while pregnant with him and performing with the Spice Girls. But for the past few months, much of the online interest around the Beckhams has focused on reports that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have fallen out with the rest of the family. The couple were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations and did not post a birthday message online, fuelling the intrigue. Nicola has in the past denied there was a feud in the family. Sir David and Lady Beckham have never acknowledged the rumoured rift, and declined to comment when asked by BBC News. We did get a hint on the topic recently from Victoria, who told the Sunday Times how she felt Liam and Noel Gallagher's reconciliation must have made their mother ""so happy"". ""As a mum, that must be... she must feel so happy to see her boys getting on,"" she said. Showbiz reporter Catrina Rose notes there was “no hint” of any alleged feud in the series. ""Victoria's setting a lot of records straight here, but she's not being drawn on this particular topic."" There's a good explanation for why she doesn't smile Getty Images Cruz Beckham, Jackie Apostel, Romeo, Harper, Victoria and David Beckham at the premiere for her new series on Wednesday night Lady Beckham's pout became her defining look in the 1990s. But in the new series, she admits there's a deeper reason as to why she never smiles. ""The minute I see a camera, I change,"" she says. ""The barrier goes up, my armour goes on, and that's when, you know, the miserable cow that doesn't smile - that's when she comes out. And I'm so conscious of that."" She adds that she would ""rather not be that person"" and wishes she had the confidence to walk out in front of cameras and smile. Elsewhere, she insists that she does actually smile. ""I've looked miserable for all these years because when we stand on the red carpet, this guy has always gone on the left,"" she says, gesturing at Sir David. ""When I smile, I smile from the left, because if I smile from the right, I look unwell. So consequently I'm smiling on the inside, but no one ever sees it, so that's why I look so moody."" New use for a noisy kitchen blender? The programme is filled with small details about the Beckhams' relationship – many of which we didn't know before. For example, Sir David starts a blender when he doesn't want to listen to Victoria (so she says, anyway). The pair have fond memories of their whirlwind romance in the 1990s, which led to them getting married and having a baby within two years. Sir David reflects that his parents - and his manager - would have preferred him to marry a local girl who stayed in Manchester, where he was playing for Manchester United. ""But I didn't want that,"" he says, opting instead for globe-trotting celebrity Victoria. ""I was so excited, I wanted everyone to know I was dating Posh Spice,"" the former England captain says. Lady Beckham, for her part, says she was never a young girl dreaming of getting married or becoming a mum. ""It wasn't until I met David that those things even occurred to me,"" she says. There won't be another Beckham baby In the final episode, which was filmed before Sir David's 50th birthday this year, the pair get reflective about everything they have achieved, and what lies ahead for them. ""Success, it feels good, I'm not going to lie,"" says Victoria. ""I've still got a lot that I want to do."" Sir David, for his part, seems to have something else on his mind. ""Now we're both, well I'm almost 50, you're 51, what's next? Another baby?,"" David asks his wife. Victoria laughs. ""Another baby? My God. No."" Victoria Beckham, a three-part documentary series, is available now on Netflix.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj4v9wre8o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/43cc/live/0f472f90-a4fd-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T10:08:18.350000+00:00,d07a8abb246d0bfd3afb16403a7c1d489324652a
cf51b078ccf3,'I missed a £100 council tax bill while in hospital – the debt ballooned to £6k',,"'I missed a £100 council tax bill while in hospital – the debt ballooned to £6k' Vicky Johnson, Lucy Parry, Alice Evans and Gerry Georgieva BBC Yorkshire & Lincolnshire Investigations Mike Barley Mike Barley was in hospital for a month following a motorbike accident When Mike Barley almost died in a motorbike crash on the way home from work, he did not think his biggest worry during recovery would be the council tax bill he had been sent that same day. But after he missed a payment reminder letter while in hospital, his debts rocketed out of control. Mr Barley, 26, from Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, had a ""well-paid"" job as a software developer, and owned his own home, but the accident in March 2021 put him in hospital for a month with broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and severe injuries to his arms and legs. The same day as the accident, Mr Barley was sent a council tax bill for an instalment of £101.71. He missed the payment and was still in hospital when a reminder letter was sent to his home, so he missed that, too. Mr Barley said he was ""stuck"" on sick pay of £90 a week at the time and remembered thinking: ""I've got no income any more - I can't work, I can't walk. Where is this money going to come from?"" He says after telling his local council he would not be able to pay, they sent another letter, in June 2021, setting out a payment plan. It included two months of reduced payments but then demanded Mr Barley pay the rest of the year's payments in advance – a total of about £1,000. Mr Barley's council acted in line with the usual process for unpaid council tax in England. If you do not pay your monthly bill after three weeks, or you have three late payments, councils can demand the remainder of the year's bill in full, and can send in bailiffs to collect the debt. Charities have long claimed the method of council tax debt enforcement in England punishes people who are genuinely struggling to pay - while the government says it is taking action against ""archaic and aggressive"" practices. BBC News Mike Barley fell behind on his bills after a motorbike accident in 2021 After further reminder letters and warnings, Mr Barley's case was passed to bailiffs, who sent a ""threatening letter"" telling him they would be coming over to seize and sell his belongings to help pay off his debt. ""It was scary to be honest,"" he said. Council tax funds public services such as care for the elderly, libraries and bin collections. It must be paid by anyone who owns a home, or lives in rented accommodation, unless they are eligible for exemptions. When councils bring in bailiffs to try to recover council tax debt, the person who owes money is charged an additional £75 for the initial bailiffs' letter, £235 plus costs if a bailiff comes to their home to remove or sell goods, a £110 sale fee if goods are taken for sale, and 7.5% of the debt value over £1,500. Mr Barley said he tried to dispute the charges he faced because of the late bill, but received no support and bailiffs continued to deliver letters to his home. ""It just makes you trapped, depressed,"" he said. More stories from the investigations team Mr Barley said his relationship broke down under the strain of trying to cope with his escalating council tax debt, which he estimates reached a total of about £6,000. He fell behind on his mortgage and other payments too. He managed to get a credit card cleared, but his home was eventually repossessed, and he said he had such little money to spend on food that his meals consisted of bread smeared with ketchup. He said his council tax debt was ""probably the worst"" to deal with because of the speed with which the total amount increased. Mr Barley still owes about £1,700 of the £6,000, including £700 of bailiffs' fees. He wants councils to stop bringing in bailiffs when the person in debt cannot pay. ""It just adds charges,"" he said. ""If [people] can't pay it in the first place, giving it to a bailiff is then going to make it harder."" Councils in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire referred about 38% more people to bailiffs in the most recent year of data than the previous 12 months, our research found. North East Lincolnshire Council said it could not comment on individual cases but had set aside a £100,000 hardship fund to support some of those unable to pay off their council tax debt. The council said on a case-by-case basis it sometimes gives people extra time to pay back their council tax, or helps them find ways to reduce their bill. Councils can decide to write off some debt too. Matt Sheeran, of free-to-use debt advice service Money Wellness, said people should seek help straight away if they did have problems paying their council tax. ""It's just so fast and so aggressive, so a lot of people are taken aback,"" he said. ""They just don't realise how quickly [it] can escalate."" Money Wellness Matt Sheeran, of Money Wellness, said the speed of the council tax debt-collection process can often take people by surprise Peter Tutton, policy director at the StepChange charity, which also offers free debt advice, added the pressure some councils put on people when they chased payments could make people's financial difficulties ""worse"". ""People respond to payment demands by missing other bills, turning their heating down, borrowing,"" Mr Tutton said. Figures published in June showed local authorities in England are owed £6.6bn in council tax in total, up 50% from £4.4bn five years ago - despite councils writing off more council tax debt than they used to. In the most recent year of data, £250m such debt was written off, in comparison to £134m five years ago. Further data obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information requests revealed: Councils are increasingly referring people to bailiffs to help retrieve outstanding debt. Across the 253 councils that provided us with information, 1.4 million accounts were referred to bailiffs in the past year – 46% more than four years ago. But the average amount they have been able to retrieve per account has gone down slightly, suggesting bailiff action may not be as effective as it used to be. In Bradford, West Yorkshire, the council referred 41% more people to bailiffs in the most recent year of data than the previous 12 months, our research found. The council put up council tax rates by almost 10% this year, as it tries to deal with rising debts which will see it owe more than £1bn by 2030. Those affected include Edmund Davies, who owes about £1,800 in council tax and is struggling to make ends meet with the £295 he receives in benefits each month. He said the council tax increase has made things much more difficult for people in his position. ""I'd like to pay it - it's just trying to come to an actual affordable agreement with the council that's difficult,"" said Mr Davies, who also pays £20 a month towards council text debt he owed from his previous address. ""To pay any more… do I eat today, do I eat this week?"" he said. BBC News Edmund Davies says the council tax increase in Bradford has been tough Mr Davies recently received groceries from the Bradford North Foodbank, where demand has risen by 30% over the past year. Foodbank manager Franco Biancardo said some of this increase was down to council tax debt. He is calling for the council to collect the debt ""in a softer way"" instead of going through the courts process. Bradford Council said it was committed to helping those struggling to pay council tax and has given an extra £1.2m in support this year. A spokesperson added that the rise in enforcement visits in the past year was due to reasons including new charges for homes left empty over a year, and clearing a backlog of cases. Central government is currently reviewing council tax debt-enforcement practices. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was ""taking robust action to tackle the archaic and aggressive collection practices that have seen vulnerable people who miss payments subjected to unmanageable lump sum payments and liability orders"". A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said councils had ""a duty to residents to collect taxes"" and that bailiffs and other enforcement were ""a last resort"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn43439n4xxo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c75f/live/c8448030-a465-11f0-8c79-29eeaf2ea52d.png,2025-10-09T05:18:07.892000+00:00,49bbe5793dc2df19667445aa716126c1e5a805a0
5b7d80f55b23,EastEnders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being parent of an autistic child,,"EastEnders' Kellie Bright on the challenges of being parent of an autistic child Kellie Bright Presenter, BBC Panorama (with additional reporting by Doug Faulkner, BBC News) Kellie Bright I've been desperate to make a documentary about special educational needs and disabilities (Send) for ages. You might know me as EastEnders' Linda Carter but I'm also a mum to my autistic son. He's also dyslexic and has ADHD. It took months of perseverance and hard work from my husband and I to try to get the right education for him. At times, it felt like a battle. That is why I wanted to make this film for Panorama, so I could meet other families who were going through the same thing, and speak to teachers, councils and the government about how Send children are educated in England. There are more than 1.7 million children in England with Send. It is a broad group, including autistic children and people who struggle with speech and language, have ADHD and physical disabilities, among other conditions. Schools in England already provide some support to these students but if parents think their child needs extra help they can make an application to their council for what's called an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). An EHCP is a crucial document because it is legally binding, states where a child should go to school and outlines how much extra support they should get. My husband and I spent hours filling in the forms to request an EHCP and many families find the process very frustrating. Buddy and Tunde Not long after I meet 15-year-old Buddy, he shows me his favourite cuddly toy, Reindeer Dog. Buddy's autistic, meaning his brain experiences and reacts to the world in a different way from many people's. He struggles with meeting people his own age, understanding his emotions and anxiety. Buddy likes to keep Reindeer Dog close to him. After moving to London from Scotland in October 2024, Buddy's mum, Tunde, started applying for schools. She says she tried at least 11 schools but many of them didn't get back to her, and those that did said they were full or could not give Buddy extra support without an EHCP. At the start of this year more than 638,000 EHCPs had been issued to children and young people in England, a 10.8% rise on the year before and an 80% increase in six years. The increase is partly because parents and schools have got better at identifying children who have special educational needs, especially autism, as opposed to there being more children with Send. It is the second time Buddy and Tunde have applied for an EHCP. Their first application was turned down before Buddy was assessed. Councils reject about a quarter of EHCP applications at the assessment stage, according to the Department for Education. When they lived in Scotland, Tunde says they did not have to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. Buddy's comprehensive school arranged support for his learning, although not for his emotional needs. Scotland has a different system for helping children with Send; schools there aim to deliver more support without the need for parents to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. ""It's a madness,"" Tunde says. ""[Getting extra support] was so easily done, and it could be easily done again."" While Buddy is not able to go to school, the council is providing him with 19 hours of lessons per week in the local library. Tunde tells me the process of applying for an EHCP has been so time consuming she had to stop working as a midwife and health visitor for a time. ""I can't do the parenting. I can't get him to these appointments, and work at the same time… I couldn't get my son seen in the right amount of time and see other people's babies in the right amount time. And it was a toss up - and my son won,"" she says. We catch up with Buddy after a lengthy speech and language assessment. ""Draining… that's all I've got for you,"" he says as he leans against a fence, Reindeer Dog tucked under his arm. Buddy often takes Reindeer Dog to give him comfort A school for Buddy It's September and as millions of children start term, Buddy is still being taught in the library. Two months after I first met him, he's getting an EHCP but his education is still not settled. The council agreed to Tunde's request that he go to an independently run school that works with children who struggle in mainstream schools. Before Buddy can start there, the school has already taken over the lessons he receives in the library. But Tunde's now not sure the school will be able to deliver what she believes her son needs to improve his social skills and confidence with children his own age. ""We were all prepared for September… and he's still not at school, he's still having one-to-one,"" she said. ""I think … preparing to be around other kids and then still just being one-to-one with adults has really knocked him back and made him not want to go to school."" Southwark Council says it takes Tunde's concerns very seriously and it will continue to support her family to ensure they receive the provision they need without further delay. It says it knows how hard it can be for families to navigate the system, and how distressing delays in securing support can be. It says it has invested in a specialist information and advice team, and now ensures children are assessed by specialist teachers at the earliest stage, and it is open to reviewing the situation when parents are concerned about education placements. 'The current system is broken' I know there is another side to this story. The huge rise in the number of EHCPs is putting councils under severe financial pressure. It is estimated by the Department for Education that English councils are set to run up a total accumulated Send deficit between £4.3bn and £4.9bn by March 2026. The government says it has invested a billion pounds to help councils pay for EHCPs and £740m on new Send school places . I went to West Sussex County Council to interview one of few people in local government prepared to talk to me on the record about Send funding. Jacquie Russell is a Conservative councillor and cabinet member for children, young people and learning. ""The current system is actually very adversarial. Our parents are increasingly tired and anxious and fed up of fighting… Staff sickness levels are really, really high at the moment,"" she says. ""The current system doesn't work. It is broken. It's not delivering the best outcomes for children."" Jacquie Russell says the current Send system is putting unsustainable pressure on councils Demand for EHCPs is now outstripping funding in West Sussex. In 2015, the council had about 3,400 children with an EHCP. Today there are more than 10,000. As a result the Send deficit has been growing year-on-year, so that at the end of 2025 it stands at more than £123m. ""That [money] is really essentially meant to be for local services. That would have ordinarily gone to repair your roads… and other local services,"" she says. ""The current position is not sustainable."" The government agrees. It is planning major reforms of the Send system, though final plans have not yet been agreed. The minister for school standards, Georgia Gould, told me the upcoming reforms were ""not taking support away from families"". ""We're wanting to put more support in earlier,"" she said. ""Where people have fought for support, and that's in place, we want to make sure that that support continues."" She also told me she wanted to work with parents to get the reforms right and to get support at the ""earliest possible point rather than having to battle"". The minister added that parents would still have a ""legal basis"" to get support. Worried parents held a rally in Westminster last month as the government mulls over reforms to the system For me, and thousands of other parents of Send children, applying for an EHCP feels like a battle about your child's future. Who does not want the best possible education for their son or daughter? But for every parent fighting, there is a council counting the cost. All eyes are now on the government to see if its reforms can relieve the pressure on so many families.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jqy8pn275o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f006/live/37372320-a07a-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-06T00:35:51.441000+00:00,a2ce4cd897a0a0405a03fa7009de95b84626b8ab
9557c8c9e3dd,What exactly is freshers' flu - and why do so many get it?,,"What exactly is freshers' flu - and why do so many get it? Getty Images It's the second week of term. You've finally figured out how to use the washing machine, your flatmates are starting to feel like friends, and the whirlwind of freshers' week is behind you. But just as things settle down, your throat starts to scratch, your nose runs, and suddenly lectures are less about learning and more about trying not to cough louder than the person next to you. You were warned it would happen, but didn't expect it to hit quite so fast. What's actually going on here? Why does everyone seem to get freshers' flu in the first few weeks of term? And why do so many say it feels worse than the average cold? ""Freshers' flu is just an assortment of common cold viruses that come and hit us all at the same time,"" says Dr Zania Stamataki, associate professor of viral immunology at the University of Birmingham. It's not an actual flu, and it's rarely serious. But when thousands of students arrive on campus they bring with them a cocktail of respiratory viruses. Add packed lecture theatres, dirty shared kitchens and late-night parties, and the result is a wave of illness that spreads quickly. Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist and professor in biomedical sciences at the University of Manchester, describes it as a ""mixing pot"" of infections. ""You're bringing people together from all over the world, putting them in close quarters, and exposing them to viruses they've never encountered before,"" she says. Respiratory viruses are constantly evolving and even small differences between variants can mean the body's immune system doesn't recognise them, forcing it to start from scratch. The role of drinking, diet and stress Getty Images The immune system is the body's natural defence against infections. It's made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to detect harmful invaders like viruses and bacteria, and help the body fight them off. But during freshers' week your immune system is under-resourced and overworked. That's because, as Prof Cruickshank explains, ""your diet, your level of activity, your level of stress, and sleep are all factors that affect immune functions."" Which, she recognises, are ""not necessarily the first focus"" for students in the early weeks of university. Among these, stress plays a particularly disruptive role. The pressure to settle in, make friends, manage new responsibilities, and keep up with academic demands can quickly become overwhelming. This triggers the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that suppresses immune responses. ""We've all had those times when you're super stressed, you've got loads of deadlines, you work, work, work, you finish all the deadlines - and then you get ill,"" says Prof Cruickshank. Stress can also impact the amount of sleep you get, which also impacts the immune system. But for many students, the pressure to socialise and make friends during freshers' week outweighs the need to rest. Imogen says freshers' flu lingers for quite a while ""I didn't want to miss out,"" says Imogen Farmer, 19, a second-year student at the University of Leeds. She says she met up with friends every evening during freshers' week. ""I definitely suffered with it after the first week, like sore throat, runny nose, those typical symptoms, and it does linger for quite a while."" Imogen says it's been worth it because ""so much of student culture, especially during freshers' week, revolves around nights out"". ""That is how you meet a lot of people and bond with friends. So I did just say yes to everything."" Getty Images But it's not just lack of sleep which makes life difficult for your immune system. After drinking a lot of alcohol - which many students will no doubt be doing - your body produces fewer white blood cells, which help to fight off infections. ""A lot of people have the misconception that if you're consuming alcohol, you sleep better. But you have higher stress and you sleep worse,"" says Dr Stamataki. A poor diet can also weaken the immune system and, for many students, eating healthily isn't easy - especially when skipping meals is a regular occurrence. You'll feel great... but you'll be transmitting With so many viruses around, you could be stuck in a lecture between two people who are sneezing, each infected with a different one. And you'd be exposed to both. Viruses can then be passed on very easily, without you knowing (during the incubation period), and before you notice symptoms. ""Sometimes you think you've gotten away with it. And you haven't,"" Dr Stamataki warns. ""So you'll feel great. You'll go and play rugby, you'll hug your friends and you'll have a good time but at the same time, you'll be transmitting."" She says that the immune response within young people is ""quite powerful"" but it's limited by the fact they haven't been exposed to many viruses yet. While everything you come across for the first time will make you sick, the next time you come across the same virus, the symptoms won't be as nasty. You can also get two infections at once. This can help or hinder your body. Either you'll start to feel really awful - because your immune system is struggling to cope - or your body's defences will start working overtime to deal with the invaders. When that happens, the immune system ""is already super pumped up,"" says Prof Cruickshank, because the body is busy making chemical messengers called cytokines that help to kill viruses. If you're unlucky enough to get a second infection soon after you've got rid of the first one, it's usually because you're already rundown. That's when conditions like bronchitis can occur. ""If your symptoms are persisting for a really long time or you felt like you're getting better and then you get ill again, it might be worth getting some medical help just to check that,"" says Prof Cruickshank. ""If you see spots at the back of your throat, that's definitely a sign that you've got strep throat and you might need some antibiotics,"" she adds. Viruses like colds and flu don't respond to antibiotics - these drugs are only used to treat some types of bacterial infection. How do I know if it's something more serious? While most viruses are mild, some can be far more dangerous and meningitis is a serious infection to watch out for. It can look a lot like freshers' flu, but if left untreated, it can lead to seizures, brain damage and sepsis. One student, from Wolverhampton, had her lower legs and parts of her fingers amputated after being struck down with it a week after starting university. Vaccines which help protect against various types of meningitis are given to children, but it's still important to be aware of the symptoms, even if you've had the jabs. So what do you need to look out for? a high temperature or fever being sick a headache a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it (but a rash will not always develop) a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures (fits) Meningitis spreads in a similar way to a cold - through close contact with someone carrying the infection. It causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, so if you recognise these symptoms, call 999 or go to A&E straight away. Emily Valentine says there is pressure to keep going during an illness There are also two new Covid variants which are spreading throughout the UK. Experts say they are likely to only cause minor illnesses, but recent genetic changes to the virus may make infections more likely. For many students, the pressure to keep going, even when sick, is hard to ignore. ""You're pushing yourself so much because that's what you're being told to do,"" says Emily Valentine, a 19-year-old student at the University of Leeds. ""I tend to rest, but I know a lot of my friends try to push themselves to go to lectures, especially in the first week,"" she adds. A shift to recording lectures during the pandemic has made it easier for students to catch up with work. But experts say you should still give yourself time to recover. ""It can take your body a while to get over a really big assault from a virus,"" says Prof Cruickshank.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147218x7rgo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eec1/live/55b7b6a0-a35b-11f0-9915-9bcc1e7b7b03.png,2025-10-04T23:05:38.967000+00:00,ca36d06b5c28fcf97fdb4b4890dd70c21923d05d
6117427ce013,Scientists win Nobel Prize for discovering why immune system does not destroy the body,,"Scientists win Nobel Prize for discovering why immune system does not destroy the body James Gallagher Health and science correspondent Getty Images The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 has been awarded for discoveries that explain how the immune system attacks hostile infections, but not the body's own cells. The prize is shared by Japan's Shimon Sakaguchi and US researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell. They discovered ""security guards"" that eliminate parts of the immune system that could attack the body. Their work is being used to develop new treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The winners share a prize fund worth 11m Swedish kronor (£870,000). ""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" says Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee. The trio's research is critical to understanding how the immune system works – how does it protect us from thousands of different infections that are trying to invade the body? But, at the same time, leaves our own tissues unscathed? Our immune system uses white blood cells that look for signs of infection – even viruses and bacteria that it has never met before. The cells use sensors – called receptors – that are made randomly in a quadrillion different combinations. This gives the immune systems the capability to attack a wide variety of invaders, but the randomness of the process inevitably makes white blood cells that can attack our body. Scientists already knew that some of these problematic white blood cells were destroyed in the thymus – where white blood cells mature. The Nobel prize this year goes to the discovery of regulatory T-cells – known as the immune system's security guards – which travel the body to disarm any other immune cells attacking the body. We know this process fails in autoimmune diseases like type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The Nobel panel added: ""The discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases."" In cancer, the regulatory T-cells stop the body from fighting the tumour so research is focused on reducing their numbers. In autoimmune diseases, trials are looking at boosting regulatory T-cells so the body is no longer being attacked. A similar approach could also be effective in reducing the risks of an organ transplant being rejected. 'Striking' Prof Shimon Sakaguchi, from Osaka University, Japan, performed experiments on mice which had their thymus removed to make them develop autoimmune disease. He showed that injecting immune cells from other mice could prevent the disease – suggesting there was some system for preventing immune cells attacking the body. Mary Brunkow, from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and Fred Ramsdell now at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, were exploring an inherited autoimmune disease in mice and people that led to the discovery of a gene important for how regulatory T-cells function. Professor Annette Dolphin, president of the UK's Physiological Society, said: ""Their pioneering work has revealed how the immune system is kept in check by regulatory T cells, preventing it from mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues. ""This work is a striking example of how fundamental physiological research can have far-reaching implications for human health.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2knwvpd7vno,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7d22/live/4ce477f0-a29a-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.jpg,2025-10-06T10:28:37.583000+00:00,5e0033b5ee5ea5f6cf47e05e2e0e50ec2c48b881
9d7e523c20f1,How weight-loss injections are turning obesity into a wealth issue,,"How weight-loss injections are turning obesity into a wealth issue Nick Triggle Health correspondent BBC Three years ago, a fashion editor friend returned from Milan Fashion Week bursting with a story to tell. Most fashion editors stayed at the same hotel, she explained, and each bedroom had its own mini fridge. After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left ""an important package"" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away. ""Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic,"" my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic? Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss. Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different. ""So many fashion people are on it,"" she tells me today. ""And now they're very vocal."" Serena Williams, Elon Musk and Whoopi Goldberg have all spoken about using weight-loss injections. Some are now prescribed by the NHS, including Wegovy and Mounjaro, generating scores of headlines. Really, this should have made it a great leveller. In theory, anyone struggling with obesity can - without the expense of a private doctor - get help to manage their weight. Only that's not the full picture. AFP via Getty Images 'So many fashion people are on it and now they're very vocal,' says one London-based fashion editor (Milan Fashion Week is pictured) Thousands of NHS patients are believed to be missing out. And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off. Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Oviva, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a ""postcode lottery"". An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support. Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to increase the list price of Mounjaro by as much as 170%. They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the rises don’t affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters. ""It's scary,"" says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s. He has been taking Mounjaro for a year and worries he may not be able to afford to continue. ""I've lost 20kg and want to keep using it, but it's a lot of money. It's unfair."" Getty Images (R) AFP via Getty Images (L) Wegovy was called the 'Viagra' of weight-loss drugs - the huge interest around it is partly fuelled by social media buzz and celebrity users, including Elon Musk Nutritionists and GPs I spoke to have also expressed concerns about the broader system, and in particular whether existing health inequalities could worsen. ""We cannot allow good health to become a luxury for the wealthiest by limiting access to weight-loss drugs to those who can pay privately,"" argues Katharine Jenner, executive director of Obesity Health Alliance. So could it really be that weight-loss injections - for all of their benefits - are turning obesity into a wealth issue? The NHS 'postcode lottery' Weight-loss drugs have been available on the NHS for some time, but the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of some newer medications - among them, semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro. Wegovy was first prescribed for obesity by the NHS in 2023, while Mounjaro followed earlier this year. They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller. Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight. They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35. Plus there are more restrictions too. For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access. Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it. (The BBC has been unable to verify this data.) A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant that makes Wegovy, told the BBC it is ""concerned about the growing disparity"" in access to NHS specialist weight management services. ""This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of deprivation where obesity rates are significantly higher."" NHS England has said the differences could be related to different levels of need and other providers being more active in certain regions, but confirmed it was up to local areas to decide how much to spend. Reuters While Ozempic is intended for those with type 2 diabetes, Wegovy is prescribed specifically for weight loss For Mounjaro, NHS England has started it for people with a BMI above 40 who also have certain health conditions. The NHS roll-out officially began in June, but a report published earlier this month suggests that not all general practices had started offering it. Just 18 out of 42 NHS boards across England confirmed that they'd begun prescribing it in line with the roll-out plan, according to data obtained by freedom of information requests published in the BMJ. The NHS has previously said it is supporting the phased rollout for eligible patients and that ""these represent brand-new services in primary care that are being established and scaled up over time"". But Mr Fidock believes we are seeing a ""postcode lottery"". ""We have got an obesity epidemic and these drugs provide us with an opportunity to tackle it in a way we have never been able to do before. But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."" Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods. Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too. One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less. For obese women it is worse still, earning 12% and 19% less respectively, based on data concerning 23,000 US workers, published in The Economist in 2023. NHS GP Matthew Calcasola, who is also involved in a service Get a Drip, which offers weight-loss drugs privately, has his own concerns. ""We're concerned health inequality will build,"" he says. ""GPs worry about this."" Private patients priced out Meanwhile, a booming private market has emerged. Sara de Souza, a business analyst from Nottingham, is among those delighted that it has. Following the birth of her son Vito in 2023, she put on 30kg. ""I got to 96kg,"" she recalls. ""Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates. ""I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."" Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck. At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice. Within a year she had lost the full 30kg. Sara says the cost didn't impact her. 'Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits' ""It completely changed my life. I felt like a new person, alive again. It's not just how I look, it's how I feel and being able to keep up with my son."" Sara says the cost didn't impact her. ""Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits."" Not everyone feels the same. Some 18% of overweight Britons would be willing to pay for weight-loss drugs - but if they were available on the NHS, 59% said they would be keen on using them, according to new polling by communications agency Strand Partners. And some of those willing to pay privately fear they could find themselves being priced out following the proposed price spike. Getty Images 'Some people can't move on to the higher doses because of cost,' says the UK head of an online pharmacy, speaking about weight-loss drugs in general ""If I'd had to pay £300 or even more, I would have really struggled to afford it,"" says Pete Beech, 57, from Southampton. He weighed 18 stone and paid £160 a month for a prescription of Mounjaro to help him lose weight to qualify for an ultrasound treatment as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. ""The way the NHS is rationing these drugs has consequences beyond just obesity."" James O'Loan, head of online pharmacy Chemist4U, has already observed some people stretching themselves financially to get hold of weight-loss drugs - some have asked for payment plans, which they cannot offer. ""Some people can't move on to the higher doses because of cost,"" he explains. Getty Images for ESSENCE Serena Williams has spoken out about using weight-loss drugs - she says, to lift 'stigma' around them Then there are concerns about a weight-loss drug black market, or unscrupulous dispensing. ""Some services are desperate to dispense the stuff and don't care what happens,"" claims Professor Richard Donnelly, editor of medical journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism. ""People are just asked to fill in a quick questionnaire. There's no proper medical assessment or follow up."" He also stresses that they should not be seen as a quick fix. ""They're not there to lose a bit of fat around the tummy."" Whilst generally well tolerated, there are risks of certain side effects — including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. A study into potential serious side effects of weight loss jabs has also been launched after hundreds of people reported problems with their pancreas. The NHS advises people never take a medicine for weight management if it has not been prescribed for them. 'Not a magic bullet' Some argue that the answer is, simply, to widen NHS access. The issue, of course, comes in part down to cost. Michael Shah, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that this could start to resolve itself in time. ""There are more than 160 weight-loss drugs in clinical development,"" he says. Once available, he predicts that the competition could push costs down across the board. ""NHS bargaining power should improve as additional players and treatments enter the space."" Kevin Mazur/WireImage via Getty Images Actress Whoopi Goldberg has said: 'I weighed almost 300 pounds... I was on all this stuff and one of the things that has helped me drop the weight is Mounjaro' Earlier this year the Tony Blair Institute suggested that the drugs should be offered to everyone with BMIs over 27, arguing that it costs even more to deal with the consequences of obesity. Obesity is estimated to cost the economy £98bn a year, according to research commissioned by the think tank, once you take into account lost productivity as well as the NHS treatment costs and the impact on the individual. The Institute suggests a means-tested system with those entitled to free prescriptions getting it free and others self-funding or encouraging employers to share the cost. NHS England has said it is looking at an option to ""accelerate roll out to even more people in the future"". But it also pointed out that weight loss drugs should not be seen as a ""magic bullet"". Are we medicalising a social issue? All of this begs a broader question - that is, in medicalising debates around tackling obesity, do we risk overlooking the wider social issue? ""By thinking we have a treatment for obesity we lose focus and stop thinking about the more difficult issues around the food industry and regulation, which are the root cause of this,"" warns Greg Fell, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health. ""I do have concerns about equity of access,"" he adds. ""But I think the NHS has carefully thought about this and probably is, more or less, in the right place."" Getty Images Obesity was rare In post-war Britain due to food shortages - there wasn't the convenience food culture of today either In post-war Britain, obesity was rare due to food shortages and physically demanding lifestyles – lower-income groups were more likely to suffer from malnutrition. Only since the 1980s have obesity rates risen across all social classes, with a growing disparity between rich and poor. It is driven by several interconnected factors. Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our ""broken food system"". ""People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food,"" she says. ""Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."" How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab. ""We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality,"" argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London. ""In such a system, casualties are inevitable. ""It would be naïve — or even pious — to claim we can simply solve this. The answer is complex and touches the very fabric of our society.""

d560663b18fe,"Why I'm challenging Nike, Adidas and Puma over single shoes",,"Why I'm challenging Nike, Adidas and Puma over single shoes Alex Taylor BBC News reporter BBC Morning Live Former Para-athletic world champion Stef Reid wants sport footwear companies to match their inclusive marketing with genuine action Stef Reid grew up as a sports-obsessed child, dreaming of playing rugby internationally. But on the eve of her 16th birthday, her life changed forever. Severe propeller lacerations from a horrific boat accident left doctors with no choice but to amputate her right foot. Initially she continued to pursue rugby, but her agility and speed weren't the same and she grew tired of comparing her performance to when she had both feet. ""I didn't want to give up on my goal just because I was an amputee, but life is constantly changing and we have to update our goals instead of forcing them to work in a reality that no longer exists,"" she says. So she moved on from rugby and took up athletics. Using a light, springy carbon-fibre blade on her right leg, she eventually became a world champion Paralympic long jumper and sprinter for both Canada and Great Britain - winning medals, breaking records and receiving an MBE. She's now retired from professional sport, but has shown a similar adaptability and resilience in her new career which includes acting, modelling and broadcasting including competing in Dancing on Ice. Now she's campaigning for big brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma to sell single shoes rather than pairs. In part it's about cost - high-end running shoes cost around £200, and when she was competing she only needed one but had to buy two, meaning she wasted hundreds of pounds on shoes she never wore. But her biggest motivation - is the principle. Many of the big brands proudly display models with blades in their shop windows, but don't sell shoes individually for athletes like Stef. ""I loved the bladed mannequins, and I wish 15-year-old Stef had seen those. ""But now I want retailers to match their inclusive imagery with the actual buying experience"". Stef isn't alone. While she wears two shoes with her day-to-day prosthetic, many other amputees don't. And beyond disability, thousands of people whose feet are different sizes are also affected by having to buy two shoes of the same size rather than two singles. Stef Reid Stef says global sports brands are yet to match their inclusive marketing with useful action for amputees needing single shoes Nike launched a single shoe programme last year, letting customers buy one shoe at half price at select stores. However this is not clearly advertised, requires the customer to contact the care support team and is not available online. When Stef raised the issue, she was not pointed to the scheme but instead offered a one-time 15% discount. ""That's not much use in the long term, as I'm always going to have one foot"". BBC Morning Live In recent years, shops have incorporated disability into their marketing, prominently featuring mannequins wearing running blades Adidas, which equip the British Paralympic team, also do not sell single shoes online. However they say it is possible to buy a single shoe in some stores, depending on stock. The company added it is in the ""advanced stages"" of finalising a comprehensive policy. Puma meanwhile, does not sell any single shoes in store or online and, like Decathlon, did not respond to a request for comment. While Nike and Adidas have made positive steps towards addressing the issue, Stef thinks sports brands should sell single shoes at all their shops and online as standard practice. Small steps Some smaller businesses and grassroots organisations are already proving it is possible. Other stories you may enjoy High street footwear company Schuh sells single shoes for half the price of a pair, while shoe chain Office also allows you to buy odd sized pairs of shoes through their outlet site. And then there's small scale solutions such as Jo's Odd Shoes, founded by Jo O'Callaghan who lost her right leg to complex regional pain syndrome. The condition makes it too painful to wear a prosthetic limb, leaving her, like many amputees, only needing one of a pair of shoes. She set up a Facebook Group where members could swap or donate spare shoes. Many retailers also donate shoes to the scheme. The items are free for members, aside from a small fee for postage and packaging. BBC Morning Live Jo, seen dealing with online orders, says her initiative offers her peace of mind in knowing that shoes will not go to waste It's a service that air sport athlete Jack Pimblett has benefited from. Born with talipes, or club foot, which stunted the growth of his right foot and leg, he struggled to find two shoes which fitted well when he was younger. He often had to put cotton wool in his shoes to fill the extra space. As an adult, he manages by buying a combination of junior and adult shoe sizes - buying a right shoe in size 5 and a left shoe in size 7. But this imposes a significant financial strain, with Jack typically spending around £150 for two pairs of shoes. ""It would be nice to be able to buy shoes that fit… [without] paying twice,"" he says. Stef acknowledges the change she's calling for takes time and money, but urges firms to push forward. ""All it takes is that first step forward in the right direction,"" she says.

9c210f076e68,What we know about rising autism rates and Trump's unproven Tylenol link,,"What we know about rising autism rates and Trump's unproven Tylenol link Getty Images US President Donald Trump has claimed there is a link between the use of painkiller Tylenol by pregnant women and an increased risk of autism in some children. Going against current scientific advice and medical opinion, he said the drug, known as paracetamol in many countries, ""is no good"" and women should ""fight like hell"" to only take it in extreme cases, such as for high fevers. Medical bodies say the drug is safe and that it remains the best treatment for pain and fever during pregnancy. What is autism and how is it diagnosed? Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world. It is a spectrum, meaning it includes a wide range of characteristics which vary from person to person. It can include those with high support needs who are non-speaking, and those with above-average intelligence who might struggle with social interaction or communication. Some autistic people may have intense interests, prefer order and routine, and use repeated movements or actions to calm themselves or express joy. Autism is not a learning disability or a mental health condition. However, the UK National Autistic Society says around a third of autistic people also have a learning disability, and rates of mental health problems are higher. There is no blood test or brain scan to determine who has autism. Instead, a diagnosis is based on a doctor's observations. How many people have autism? The number of children diagnosed with autism has risen sharply in many countries. In the US, one in 31 children were identified with autism in 2022, up from 1 in 149 in 2000. The rate for eight-year-old boys was significantly higher than for girls. In the UK, research published in the Lancet medical journal in 2023 found that one in 34 children aged 10 to 14 years old were diagnosed with autism (in 2018). Comparing autism rates for different countries is difficult. The way the figures are collected tends to change based on diagnostic practices, awareness levels, healthcare access and cultural differences. Research published in 2022 looked at 71 studies and found an average prevalence of around 1%. Numbers ranged from 0.075% in Bangladesh to 3.9% in Australia. Why have rates of autism been rising? While the number of people officially identified or diagnosed with autism has risen sharply, most researchers believe that this reflects increased awareness and changes to the way it is classified. For example, some people who have difficulty with social interaction and non-verbal communication were once told they had Asperger's Syndrome. But, in 2013, the diagnostic criteria of ASD – or Autism Spectrum Disorder – was broadened to include people with Asperger's Syndrome in the US. The same wider definition has been used in countries, including the UK, which saw an eight-fold rise in new autism diagnoses between 1998 and 2018 . A 2007 study in the UK found that as, long as the same criteria was being used, rates of autism were similar in adults and children. This supports the idea that it is more recognised today than in the past. However, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr has sharply criticised that view, describing it as ""epidemic denial"". At a news conference in April, he described autism as ""preventable"". He has previously offered several debunked theories about the causes, including blaming vaccines, despite a lack of evidence. Does Tylenol cause autism? Getty Images No, there is no evidence that Tylenol causes autism. Trump's comments have shocked many medical bodies, which recommend the drug for pain and fever during pregnancy. The widely held view of researchers worldwide is that there is no single cause of autism. It is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. For scientists looking at the data, it is difficult to separate out the effects of one action, like taking a painkiller, from other factors such as parental health, genetics and environmental conditions. The Trump administration has cited some recent studies which have shown a potential association, which means the drug could increase the risk of autism in some children. But there may be other explanations for that link. In August, a team led by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US analysed 46 older studies. Of these, 27 reported a link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in the painkiller, and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD. Nine showed no significant link and four indicated an opposite, protective, effect. The authors said more work was needed to confirm their findings but recommended ""cautious, time-limited use"" of the painkiller during pregnancy. Another study, in 2024, analysed 2.5 million babies born in Sweden. It compared autistic children with their siblings to control for genetic factors, and found no evidence to support a causal link between autism and the use of the painkiller. And a Japanese study published earlier this year did not find meaningful evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism. The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, says that based on existing data there is not enough evidence to support a link between Tylenol and autism. But it says that taking any medication during pregnancy should be approached with caution and medical advice should be sought. In a statement to the BBC, Tylenol maker Kenvue said the science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. ""We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."" What is the advice on pain relief in pregnancy? Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is the recommended first-line medication for pain and fever during pregnancy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and other medical organisations worldwide. There is some evidence that high fevers during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can harm the baby, with a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, or birth defects called NTDs, or neural tube defects. Following Trump's announcement, health officials stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: ""I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this."" As with any pain-relieving medicine, it should be used at the lowest effective dose, for the shortest possible time and as infrequently as possible. Ibuprofen is not usually recommended, unless it's prescribed by a doctor, especially if someone is more than 20 weeks pregnant, because it can affect the baby's circulation and kidney function. Paracetamol is considered to be one of the safest drugs in the world when taken at the correct dose. Like all medicines, there is an overdose risk if more than the recommended dose is taken. For adults, the usual dose is one or two 500mg tablets at a time, up to four times in 24 hours, according to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. It describes paracetamol as the ""first choice"" pain killer for women who are breastfeeding. What is folinic acid or leucovorin? Getty Images Pregnant women and those trying to conceive are advised to take folic acid - the synthetic version of the vitamin folate US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jnr also signalled that a drug called leucovorin, normally given to cancer patients to reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy, would soon be approved as a treatment for children with autism. But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. Folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in many foods and helps the body form health red blood cells. The Autism Science Foundation says that low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent. Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. Other studies did not find a significant association. The charity says the suggestion that folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of a cancer drug known as leucovorin or folinic acid. Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin. Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out. One, from 2016, studied 48 autistic children in the US and found improvements in verbal communication compared with a placebo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq51dry7wgo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0b23/live/cc355f10-9854-11f0-8d62-215a8506b20f.jpg,2025-09-23T10:54:16.221000+00:00,a977dffb36b575aef9f99cfd91abe6d6e8dd46f0

But now he's curating a uniquely personal playlist - the songs of his own life to carry him through terminal illness. The list includes both November Rain and Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, Apache by The Shadows - which inspired Dave to play guitar - and Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Hazel O'Connor's 1980 hit Will You? is dedicated to his wife and mother to their two children. An ode to tentative yet powerful romantic tension, it is known for its saxophone solo - an instrument Dave also learned to play. ""It's our tune from when we got together,"" Dave tells BBC's Morning Live, tapping his feet. As the song evokes memories, his wife Kate quietly adds ""the fight was worth it."" Kate Gilmore/BBC Morning Live Dave is curating a playlist of songs from throughout his life to carry him through terminal illness Moments like this emphasise the power of music to forge everlasting connection. Its therapeutic benefits are increasingly recognised in palliative and end of life care. The impact is neurological as well as emotional, explains Sarah Metcalfe, managing director of the Utley Foundation's Music for Dementia campaign. Brain activity scans show music ""lights up"" multiple parts of our brain, simultaneously touching physical and emotional sense centres. ""Even if one part of the brain is damaged, those other parts can still be accessed,"" Sarah says. Kate Gilmore Dave and Kate on their wedding day in 1986 UK charity Marie Curie surveyed 1,000 adults whose loved ones had received care in the final stages of life. It found listening to music together helped to create a shared experience that brought them closer, creating a sense of normality and helping them relax. Kate experienced this first hand. When Dave once returned home after a lengthy hospital stay, he was twitchy and exhausted but unable to sleep. Out of desperation she turned to Native American music, one of his favourite genres to relax to. Other stories you may enjoy ""And then all of a sudden, this agitated, anxious man began to sleep,"" she recalls. Diana Schad, a staff nurse at the Marie Curie hospice in Glasgow with 19 years of experience as well as a musician herself, has installed a piano for patients and volunteers to use. She says it is important to consider the feelings music evokes. ""You've always got to ask yourself, is this what they would like to be feeling at the moment?"" says Diana. How to make a good palliative playlist 1. Focus on music memories between ages 10-30, which is when the strongest associations are formed 2. Include songs connected to special, significant places and important life events - youth, holidays, romance, first dances and wedding songs 3. Consider feelings sparked by songs - these can be just as powerful as memory association 4. Remember that music can trigger memories even for people with conditions like dementia by connecting multiple brain regions. Use resources like BBC Music Memories to spark memory recall 5. Be open to unexpected musical connections, like TV show themes or commercial jingles that might hold special meaning Source: Music for Dementia's managing director, Sarah Metcalfe Marie Curie Diana, a musician in her spare time, says music plays a pivotal role in end-of-life care Experts agree that music can reduce anxiety and psychological pain, even when someone is unconscious. Dr Sam Murphy, senior lecturer at the Open University, specialises in thanatology, the study of death and the practices associated with it. ""There's certainly evidence to suggest that hearing is the last sense to go so even when someone is unconscious or unresponsive, music can still reach them,"" she says. ""It keeps them connected to their surroundings, to the people they love, and to the sense of being alive and those memories that they've had."" An everlasting comfort in death Music can be equally helpful to loved ones after a person has passed away. ""I think it's just another distraction for those people that are mourning a loved one,"" Dr Murphy says. ""But there's that comfort in knowing that they're listening to something that their loved one would have listened to over the years."" This is true for Anna-Kay Brocklesby, whose husband Ian passed away from prostate cancer in 2023. As Ian's health deteriorated, sharing his favourite songs became a crucial part of their family's coping mechanism. It became a way to keep spirits up and stay positive, says his wife. ""Every morning he would go down and make the tea, he would play. Oh, What a Beautiful Morning from the musical Oklahoma,"" she says. ""And he would belt it out.

5d7c827d06d8,'My girl can't walk or talk': Searching for answers in Wales' rare disease cluster,,"'My girl can't walk or talk': Searching for answers in Wales' rare disease cluster Rachel Cowley found out that her daughter Jessica has DRPLA in May this year Rachel Cowley's daughter Jessica was like any other 10-year-old until she started having seizures. Now aged 20, Jessica is unable to walk or talk, and Ms Cowley fears she will die in the next few years. ""I hope when the time comes it is quick,"" said Ms Cowley. ""But I just don't think it's going to be."" Jessica is one of a ""cluster"" of people in south Wales affected by Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy , or DRPLA, an inherited and progressive neurological disorder for which there is no known treatment or cure. DRPLA was believed to mainly affect people of Japanese origin and considered rare in the UK, until a 2007 research study found a relatively high prevalence of the condition in Wales. The symptoms of DRPLA can vary significantly, but generally include progressive memory loss and personality change, impaired control of body movements, muscle spasms, seizures and psychiatric disturbances. It is caused by a gene defect, and a person with the condition has a 50% chance of passing it on to a child of their own. Dr Mark Wardle, a consultant neurologist who authored the 2007 study, said there were a number of ""common founders"" with DRPLA in south Wales which had resulted in the current ""cluster of patients in their 20s or 30s"". ""It doesn't take many generations to have very many more cases just from the most common founders,"" he added. Rachel Cowley Jessica has lost the ability to walk and talk as a result of DRPLA Ms Cowley said Jessica was initially diagnosed with epilepsy aged 10, when she began having seizures. ""We could never control it,"" said Ms Cowley, 45, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf. But when Jessica turned 13, Ms Cowley said her daughter's legs began to ""give way"". The teenager, who previously loved doing gymnastics and horse riding, was now struggling to walk. ""I noticed that she could hardly walk up the stairs,"" said Ms Cowley. ""When she lost her voice, I just thought, these ain't signs of epilepsy, there's got to be something else."" After ""years of wondering"" why her health was deteriorating, Jessica was diagnosed with DRPLA in May. Rachel Cowley Jessica was ten when she started to have seizures Jessica now uses a wheelchair and is completely non-verbal. ""It's quite scary because she's been going through this for the last five to seven years,"" said Ms Cowley. ""I would speak to the consultant and they just did not know why she was deteriorating like she was. ""I think it's because of this disease being so rare."" Ms Cowley is part of a group called DRPLA in south Wales on Facebook, which currently has more than 100 members. Ms Cowley said it was a ""massive surprise"" to find other people in her area were facing the same challenges. ""We're all connected in a way,"" she said. ""It's nice to talk to some of them and have advice off them, because if I phone the GP, they don't know nothing about it."" Rachel Cowley, Zoe Hoes, Emma Davies and Zoe Lock all met in the DRPLA south Wales group Zoe Hoes adopted her eight-year-old daughter Gabriella when she was a baby. Last year, she was contacted by social services who said that a member of Gabriella's birth family had tested positive for DRPLA. Ms Hoes, 47, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, noticed her daughter was twitching at night and thought she might have symptoms. ""I managed to get a private test done and that confirmed that she did have it,"" Ms Hoes added. She said she was left ""scrambling to find out information"" about the condition. ""It's terrible because at the moment there is no treatment and no cure. ""You love them so much and you don't want to lose them."" Ms Hoes said the private test cost her ""in the region of £2,000"" which she acknowledged was unaffordable for many. ""A lot of families haven't got that money to spend,"" she said. ""So they just carry on with their lives, and anyone's child could meet someone with [DRPLA] and end up being a carer for their partner and children."" Zoe Hoes Zoe Hoes says it is ""heartbreaking"" thinking about her daughter's future with DRPLA Ms Hoes would like to see more people being tested for the condition at a younger age. ""[Parents] need to be able to make plans for those children's futures because, ultimately, they're going to be caring for them,"" she said. Dr Wardle began his research study into the DRPLA prevalence in south Wales after finding ""several families"" with the condition. He said the DRPLA gene, also known as the ATN1 gene, was crucial in understanding the disorder. If the gene expands in a large way ""over multiple generations"" a person will ""probably have a more aggressive disease than [their] parent"", explained Dr Wardle. He said the current generation of DRPLA patients had, in this way, experienced ""more severe disease"". ""That's why it feels as if we've suddenly got more patients,"" he said. ""When I first found patients with this disease in south Wales, they were in their 50s or 60s. ""Now we've got a cluster of patients in their 20s or 30s and that's why we're seeing that difference."" Symptoms can vary amongst patients depending on the age at which the condition first appears Dr Wardle said it was ""very difficult"" to diagnose DRPLA because it was ""astonishingly rare"" compared to similar conditions like epilepsy. ""Unless you've got a family history, people aren't even going to consider it,"" he added. He said raising awareness about DRPLA was a ""really good thing"" as it would make people think about it earlier. ""Getting good access to neurological services and genetic testing is really important to push this forward,"" he added. But Dr Wardle said there were ""moral and ethical issues"" with testing people under the age of 18. He said people needed to be mature enough to ""understand the consequences"" of being tested for the ""life-changing"" condition. ""You can't do that if you're six or 12-years-old. ""I know of one patient who has been devastated by being screened for this disease,"" he added. Clinical trial 'hope' Dr Wardle said it would be ""very different"" if there was treatment available. ""I think we'd change our approach because we want to identify those patients early. ""But that would be on the basis of early access to treatment, which we don't have at the moment."" The families affected in Wales said that clinical trials in the US for a potential treatment were providing ""hope"". But Dr Wardle said these trials could ""potentially"" cause more harm to families by ""raising expectations"". ""There's a pipeline where you've got to prove safety and then prove efficacy, and you've got to do that right,"" he said. Silvia Prades Dr Prades says there have been positive developments in trials taking place in the US Dr Silvia Prades is a research manager at the charity Ataxia UK and CureDRPLA. She is currently working with a team based in the US who are trialling a treatment on two people living with DRPLA. She said the early results had been positive with one of the people on the trial, a teenage boy, showing signs of improvement. ""He's now able to walk a few steps without assistance. He has regained some small movement in his hands and his speech is a bit clearer,"" she said. The second patient, a woman in her 30s, was more advanced in the condition and Dr Prades said any improvement had been ""less obvious"". She said the treatment effects could ""vary"" but felt the results were ""encouraging"". Dr Prades said she understood why people wanted testing at an earlier age but stressed that it was a ""personal choice"". ""Some people will feel empowered by having this knowledge. Others feel a huge burden,"" she said. Dr Prades said a ""combination of many different factors"" might explain why DRPLA prevalence appeared to be higher in south Wales than the rest of the UK. ""Perhaps it is the access to genetic testing has improved. It could also be that people are more aware of the condition,"" she said. ""It could also be that the stigma on genetic conditions is being removed."" She said there had been an ""increase"" in the number of families ""engaging"" with her team in recent times, which could be because people are experiencing the symptoms of DRPLA at an earlier age.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qqvyrdkwo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3776/live/43fc4560-978b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-22T04:58:54.630000+00:00,95be4ea3851327871f7a11ed545193c09f015f4e
9b49313fda50,"How to avoid period leaks - the pros and cons of cups, pants and tampons",,"How to avoid period leaks - the pros and cons of cups, pants and tampons Getty Images Finding the right period product for you can be a difficult task For many of us, our first lessons about periods were brief and practical, often limited to learning how to use pads or tampons. Alongside these traditional options, there's now a wider range of products available, including reusable options such as menstrual cups, period pants and washable pads. Making the choice about which one is best for you can be overwhelming. You might wonder how these products work and whether they're foolproof enough to put the fear of bleeding through your clothes at bay. Dr Tempest, a consultant gynaecologist at the University of Liverpool, spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread about how each product works and the pros and cons to help you decide which might suit you best. Menstrual cup Getty Images Menstrual cups are small flexible cups made of medical-grade silicone. You fold and insert them into the vagina, where they collect blood rather than absorbing it. Dr Tempest says there are different types of cups available to buy based on how heavy your flow is or whether you've had children. Hygiene is also really important so make sure you wash your hands before you insert the cup and clean the cup between uses, she adds. Pros The most eco-friendly period product Holds up to three times more blood than a tampon Can be worn for up to 12 hours Reusable for years - they can last up to 10 years but between two and four years is the average Cost effective over time Cons Takes practice to insert and remove May take time to find the right fit Messy to empty, especially in a public toilet Needs sterilising between cycles Larger upfront cost which can be around £20 to £25 Period pants Getty Images Period pants are underwear with built-in absorbent layers. You wear them like normal pants then rinse, wash and dry them for reuse. They're particularly popular for sleeping or on lighter days. Leakage worries are normal but Dr Tempest says they are reliable for most people and have a built-in waterproof layer and odour lining. Pros Looks and feels like regular underwear No shifting around and last between six and eight hours Reusable and eco-friendly - they last between two and three years Can be layered with other products for extra protections Cons Can have an expensive upfront cost - prices start from around £10 and go up to £50 Requires washing and drying between uses May not be absorbent enough for heavy flows Inconvenient for travel without access to laundry Will need to carry a used pair home with you if changing them during the day Reusable pads Getty Images Reusable pads look similar to disposable ones but are usually made from cotton or bamboo and fasten around your underwear with poppers. Instead of throwing them away, you rinse, wash and dry them to use again. Pros Softer and more comfortable to wear than plastic-based pads Eco-friendly so popular if you're wanting a more sustainable option Variety of sizes and absorbencies Cost effective over time Can last between three and five years Cons Need to be washed after each use Requires planning - they must be dried properly between uses says Dr Tempest as damp fabric against your skin can increase the risk of infection Bulkier than disposable pads Less convenient if you're out of the house as you'll need to carry the used ones home with you Disposable Pads Getty Images Disposable sanitary pads are the most commonly used period product - they stick into your underwear, absorb blood externally and are wrapped and binned after use. Dr Tempest advises changing pads regularly (every four to six hours) and they shouldn't be worn for more than eight hours as they can irritate the skin if worn for too long. Pros Simple to use Widely available in many different sizes from ultra-thin to thick night pads Good for overnight protection Can be more comfortable for beginners Cons Can feel bulky or shift out of place Not practical for water-based sports, such as swimming Environmentally harmful - an average pack of pads holds the same amount of plastic as five carrier bags according to Dr Tempest More expensive than reusable options over time - women spend around £5,000 on period products over a lifetime Tampons Getty Images Tampons are also commonly used and inserted into the vagina, where they soak up blood before it leaves the body. Dr Tempest stresses that they must be correctly disposed of. Every day, 2.5 million tampons are flushed down the toilet when they should be placed in a bin. Pros Discreet and small enough to carry in a pocket Good for sports and swimming Range of absorbencies Cons Requires insertion which some people may find uncomfortable Low risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) if worn for too long Environmentally unfriendly More expensive over a lifetime compared to reusable products",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl1z3jxy56o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/30d4/live/7fe18ea0-9556-11f0-a9d0-b91ec0b66439.jpg,2025-09-23T23:02:07+00:00,ee8464ccfeb22c94b8244e16ca9ef3826988e1ba
b994d26159ba,Cut and bulk: Teenagers explain why they want to get ripped,,"Cut and bulk: Teenagers explain why they want to get ripped Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter George Holland George is currently in a ""bulking"" stage, but will then enter a ""cut"" phase where calories are reduced Ripped. Shredded. Jacked. Swole. Which are you? Gym jargon such as this, which refers to the size and definition of muscles, has long been heard exchanged between pumped men in gym locker rooms - and now among teenagers too. TikTok videos show boys as young as 13 and 14 in school toilets, flexing veiny biceps which bulge out of their school uniforms. The quest for brick-like abs has become serious business - even if you're still only in Year 8 - with posts on socials with hashtags like #shreddedphysique being viewed more than four billion times. The desire to get this look, for many, might mean doing a few deadlifts and drinking a protein shake from time to time. For others, it could be working out a few times a week, playing sport and eating a lot of chicken. But for a growing few it means going to the gym most nights, often following intense training regimes from social media, and learning how to ""cut and bulk"". The cut and bulk cycle consists of eating hundreds of calories more than your recommended daily intake to get bigger, retaining some fat in the process, then several weeks later cutting calorie intake down to lose the fat for a leaner, more defined look. It can be all-consuming, and involves a lot of calorie counting, working out and dedication. Some sports nutritionists say it can be harmful - affecting hormone health, growth, and development, and could potentially lead to problems with eating disorders such as muscle dysmorphia - the idea your body is smaller and less muscly than it actually is. I've spoken to three teenagers, who all share a love of the gym, about what is driving them to get ripped this way. The 14-year-old body builder George Holland George started going the gym when he was aged 11, lifting no more than 10kg When George Holland first walked on stage he thought he might feel nervous. The 14-year-old was by far the youngest contestant in the under-19s category of the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association finals. Wearing fake tan and a pair of small trunks, it might have felt a bit exposing to start flexing his muscles before an audience of hundreds - but, George says, ""I had practised everything and I knew there was nothing to be worried about."" He went on to win the bronze medal. George joined a gym when he was 11, having watched some of the bodybuilding greats online who inspired him to give it a go. In the early days, he explains, he would work on each muscle group twice a week, lifting no more than 10kg - the heaviest permitted for a child under 16 at his local leisure centre. But, after changing gyms, for a ""proper gym vibe"", he says, he could start to increase the load, working out alongside 20-30-year-olds. George Holland George was the youngest contestant in the under-19s category of the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association finals After seeking out more experienced men from whom to learn, George is now coached by a former Mr Universe, Eddie Ellwood. He's bench-pressing 140kg, squatting 180kg, and deadlifting 200kg. His drive, he says, comes from looking at others in the gym and wanting to be as big as them. George eats six meals a day, goes to school, trains hard (four days on, one day off, four days on) and posts to his 140,000 followers on TikTok and Instagram. He's currently in a ""bulking"" stage, he explains, consuming around 4,100 calories a day. After 16 weeks, he will start to cut, gradually reducing his calorie intake to 2,200 a day. When I ask if he's worried about the intensity of his fitness regime and the desire to look big at such a young age, he's very clear: ""I completely disagree with that, going to the gym when you are young is dead good for you. ""It's good for your mental health, your overall fitness, and it gives you good discipline."" 'You can't cheat getting bigger' George Hazard was 12 when he started working out. That was during lockdown and his home gym consisted of a pull-up bar, a few weights, and a plastic bench in his garage. Now 17, he says going to the gym has become a bit of an addiction - he's there five or six nights a week - and along with his mates, he bulks out and cuts back. George feels it's helped him stay mobile since recovering from a leg-lengthening operation where a nail was put through his femur bone, after he was born with one leg shorter than the other. He says you can get ""fountains of knowledge"" from social media, especially around optimal muscle growth. George Hazard George first started working out at home, in a home gym, during lockdown But how do you distinguish between well-tested, science-based recommendations and other, less informed suggestions, I ask him? ""Once you've spent a good few hours on TikTok for example, you get a feeling for what is a load of rubbish and what is good stuff,"" George replies. ""For a start - the decent ones put links to studies alongside their content."" He says you can work out and eat well, but it can be difficult being so young because you ""can't stick to a strict diet and tell your parents exactly what they have to make for tea"". George does eat lot of chicken, has several eggs for breakfast, and says his grandma is very good at giving him a high protein diet. There is a movement of young people who are interested in health, fitness and working out, he says, and he feels that's no bad thing. ""You work hard and see the results,"" George says. ""You can't really cheat getting bigger."" The former 'dirty bulker' Nat Wolny Nat often cuts and bulks to get a more defined look Seeing his uncle powerlifting spurred Nat Wolny into working out aged 12 - and he's loved the gym since ""day one"". Between the ages of 13 and 16, he tried ""dirty bulking"" - a process of eating huge amounts of food to get big. The more he worked out, the bigger he grew. But it became unsustainable. Nat, who is now 18, says he was eating 80% junk, 20% nutritious food and while he might have looked jacked on the outside, on the inside his ""gut was a mess"". ""I had really bad acne and I felt really self-conscious."" He tried cutting out fast food and other ultra-processed foods, then he found the carnivore diet and began to fast. The carnivore diet does not come without risks, but Nat is adamant it works for him. The 18-year-old shows me the main foods that that he eats: raw steak, eggs and raw milk. ""It's an ancestral diet,"" Nat says, ""which is what we survived off - it's primal."" Ruth Clegg, BBC Nat follows a raw food diet which consists of eggs, raw milk and raw meat Nat fasts for 20 hours a day, to improve his mental clarity, he says. His family have always been supportive of his choices, but even they have found it difficult to adjust to his regime. Some studies suggest intermittent fasting can have some positive effects as an adult, but it can be harmful for teenagers because they still need fuel for growth. Nat says he had a ""spiritual awakening"" after fasting for a week - using ChatGPT for advice and guidance. Fasting for more than three days can have an impact on major organs . Using AI bots to help devise fitness plans is something many do, but they should be used with caution - the quality of the information they provide is variable and may not have any credible evidence behind it. What's his endgame I ask Nat, surely this kind of lifestyle is difficult to maintain? He wants to promote his way of life online, to ""help others"" he says. ""I'll keep going for as long as I can. I have recently read something that does not recommend fasting, so if I start to feel bad, then I can just change my diet."" Where does this go next? All the experts I've spoken to agree there's nothing wrong with the desire to be fit and healthy, especially from a young age. But what does that mean? Is ""fit and healthy"" becoming increasingly wrapped up in a tight torso and sculpted pecs? ""Too often, it's about the look, rather than what healthy really means, which comes in all shapes and sizes,"" children's dietician Lucy Upton explains. She says this growing trend is not only pushing some teenagers to extremes, the advice online on how to achieve it often lacks credible evidence. ""Sometimes content [on socials, for example] can nod to a scientific truth, but when examined that 'truth' is in a completely different context,"" says Ms Upton. In the first instance, she recommends looking more closely at the person posting the content - thinking about whether it's coming from personal experience or a clinical background, and whether it applies to your own situation. ""And if someone is trying to sell something they are endorsing - then that's a big red flag."" Meanwhile, Sam Grady-Graham, a GB Boxing coach, says following restrictive eating regimes in your teens is potentially harmful. He says the rate of growth between 12 and 18 is ""exponential"", so the body needs a full and nutritious diet to fuel it. Foodwise that's a balanced, holistic diet from the main food groups - fruit, vegetables, grains, proteins and dairy - and not going to extremes. When it comes to working out, and varying levels of intensity, he says don't go too hard too quickly. ""Movement over muscle is the way we look at it,"" he says. ""Get the movement right when you're lifting. You might not see progress immediately, but long term, you set yourself a strong foundation to build upon.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg964v18l6o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/334c/live/195bb090-8fb4-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,2025-09-14T05:06:27.959000+00:00,78ba4ccadf8a7a900c37da75f9877bba48e0950f
4cff0712c7b6,Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agency,,"Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agency AP In fiery Senate testimony this week, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr once again set his sights on the nation's top public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His appearance came days after he suddenly fired the new CDC director, Susan Monarez, provoking a group of senior staff to resign in protest. At the hearing, when asked for an explanation, Kennedy claimed he had asked Ms Monarez if she was a ""trustworthy person"" and she had replied ""no"", to some disbelief from his opponents in the room. He then admitted he had once described the CDC as the ""most corrupt"" agency in government, and strongly hinted he's not finished with his plans to shake up the organisation. Kennedy's words have sparked a furious backlash, with many doctors and scientists increasingly concerned that America's public health systems are being dangerously compromised. It's a conflict that could have a significant impact not just on health policy in the US but across the world. In the past, the CDC has been instrumental in global health, leading the response to crises from famine, to HIV, to Ebola. Founded in 1946, the CDC tracks emerging infectious diseases like Covid and is also tasked with tackling long-term or chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. It operates more than 200 specialised laboratories and employs 13,000 people, although that number has been cut by around 2,000 since President Donald Trump returned to office. It does not approve or licence vaccines. That responsibility lies with the Food and Drug Administration. But it does produce official recommendations on who should receive which vaccines through a panel of experts - known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - and monitors their side effects and other safety concerns. Vaccine dispute Politico AP It was Kennedy's record on vaccines which particularly worried many public health experts when he took office in February. An activist group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccination. He has described the Covid jab as the ""most deadly in history"" and has blamed rising rates of autism on vaccines, an idea that has been categorically debunked by large scientific studies over many years. So feathers were seriously ruffled just weeks into his tenure when it emerged he had hired a noted vaccine critic, David Geier, to look again at the CDC data on that scientifically disproven link. Then in June, Kennedy suddenly sacked the entire ACIP panel which advises the CDC on vaccine eligibility after accusing all 17 members of being ""plagued with persistent conflicts of interest"". A new committee, handpicked by the administration, now has the power to change, or even drop, critical recommendations to immunise Americans for certain diseases, as well as shape the childhood vaccination programme, although the CDC itself still has the final say on whether to accept that advice. It's that decision which has now been linked to the firing of the agency's new director in late August, only 29 days into the job. In a newspaper article this week Ms Monarez said she was sacked from the CDC after being told, by Kennedy, to ""pre-approve"" the recommendations of the ACIP committee which she said had now been filled with people who have expressed ""antivaccine rhetoric"". ""It is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected,"" she wrote. ""I lost my job, America's children could lose far more."" In his testimony Kennedy stood his ground, accusing her of lying about that exchange and describing her dismissal as ""absolutely necessary"". ""We need bold, competent and creative new leadership at CDC, people able and willing to chart a new course,"" he said. Ms Monarez's sacking led to a fresh wave of resignations at the agency as senior staff continue to walk out. Over the last two weeks the CDC has lost its chief medical officer, its director of immunisation and its director of emerging diseases, amongst others. ""A huge top tier of CDC leadership has been removed, but this is also in the wake of the firing of thousands of CDC workers, including many well-respected experts,"" says Dr Fiona Havers, a senior vaccine researcher who herself resigned from the agency in June. ""I'm a physician, and for my own integrity as a scientist, I did not feel I could continue to serve in that administration when it felt like the data we were putting together was not going to be used in an evidenced, science-based way."" Kennedy was also criticised by some CDC staff for what they felt was a lacklustre response to a shooting at the agency's Atlanta headquarters in August. The gunman, who reportedly believed the Covid vaccine had made him sick, killed a policeman before turning the weapon on himself . Kennedy visited the offices in the aftermath but he did not meet with staff members and continued to criticise the agency's performance. He did, though, start his testimony this week with a tribute to David Rose, the police officer who died in the shooting. For the moment, Jim O'Neill, one of Kennedy's top advisers, has been tapped up to run the CDC on an interim basis, until a new permanent director can be found. Mr O'Neill served in several roles in the health department under President George W Bush, but he has a business rather than a science background. ""During the previous administration, CDC lost public trust by manipulating health data to support a political narrative,"" he wrote on social media on the day he was appointed. ""We are helping the agency earn back the trust it has squandered."" More changes are certainly likely. In his Senate hearing Kennedy said the CDC had lied to Americans in the pandemic about mask wearing, social distancing and the ability of the vaccine to stop the transmission of coronavirus. ""I need to fire some of those people and make sure this doesn't happen again,"" he said. Global repercussions The next flashpoint could come later this month. On 18 September the CDC's new vaccine advisory panel is due to meet to discuss Covid vaccines and other shots, including for hepatitis B and the RSV virus. The panel's recommendations and the CDC's response will be carefully scrutinised, not just in the US but around the world. ""What happens in America is of great importance,"" says Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization (WHO) and a professor of public health at University College London. ""We've done so much to protect science from political interference over the past 200 years and the concern is that America will pay a price for it and we might too, if we go in that direction."" In the past, CDC teams have also had a major hands-on role in global health protection. In 2015, for example, the agency had 3,000 staff working on the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with 1,200 of those on the ground in west Africa. After taking office, President Trump withdrew the US from the WHO and ordered the CDC to cut off all communication with the organisation. The concern from former CDC staffers like Dr Fiona Havers  is what might happen if and when the next Ebola or Covid is eventually spotted and starts spreading. ""Taking a sledgehammer to the CDC and undercutting its programmes has left the US much less prepared for another pandemic,” she says. “And that really has huge implications globally if another health emergency were to arise.”",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ngkpxk9lo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5db9/live/054073e0-8a67-11f0-b758-393fbf15c843.jpg,2025-09-06T00:24:45.238000+00:00,f897de9b689581f3418f758e44094b09f5a39f81

In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care.

The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. ""His eyes lit up,"" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. ""He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do."" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away. A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father's head. Harold Dillard's body was ""mutilated"", his daughter Farrah Fasold says At the company's warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people. ""All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,"" a detective wrote at the time. Ms Fasold says she imagined her father's body would be handled with respect - but instead it was ""mutilated"", she believes. ""I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn't sleeping."" The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment. This was Ms Fasold's first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers: private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres. For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes. Although Ms Fasold didn't realise it at the time, her father's case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death. The body business Since at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors. Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600 ""whole-body donations"", and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so. Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says: ""A  lot of people are either educated or interested in education."" But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says; many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free. The Body Shop Conversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West. Like most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled. But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US: a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers,  though the firms call themselves ""non-transplant tissue banks"". Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are medical engineering firms, which use limbs to test products like new hip implants. The for-profit body part trade is effectively outlawed in the UK and other European countries, but looser regulation in the US has allowed the trade to flourish. The largest investigation of its kind - conducted by Reuters journalist Brian Grow, in 2017 - identified 25 for-profit body broking companies in the US. One of them earned $12.5m (£9.3m) over three years from the body-part business. Some of those firms are broadly respected, and claim to follow rigorous ethical guidelines. Others have been accused of disrespecting the dead and exploiting vulnerable people in grief. A global trade The trade has grown because of a gap in US regulation, says Jenny Kleeman, who spent years researching the topic for her book, The Price of Life. Whilst the UK's Human Tissue Act makes it illegal in almost all cases to profit from a body part, no comparable law exists in the US. Technically, the US's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act bans the sale of human tissue - but the same law allows you to charge a ""reasonable amount"" for the ""processing"" of a body part. These loose laws have turned the US into a global exporter of cadavers. In her book, Kleeman found that one of the largest US players shipped body parts to more than 50 countries, including the UK. ""In many countries, there is a shortfall of donations,"" Ms Kleeman says. ""And where they can get bodies is from America."" There is no formal register of brokers, and official statistics are hard to find. But Reuters calculated that, from 2011 to 2015, private brokers in the US received at least 50,000 bodies, and distributed more than 182,000 body parts. 'Bodies of the state' For some, private body brokers represent the very worst sort of ambulance-chasing greed. In his Reuters investigation, Mr Grow found cases of brokers becoming ""intertwined with the American funeral industry"" via arrangements in which funeral homes introduce brokers to relatives of the recently-deceased. In return, the home received a referral fee, sometimes exceeding $1,000 (£750). Horror stories are easy to find - and because of the US's light regulation, there's often no legal recourse when things go wrong. After her run-in with Bio Care, Ms Fasold hoped for a criminal prosecution. As well as the fact that her father's limbs may have been cut with a chainsaw, she was unhappy about a package she had received in the post, in a zip-lock bag, which the company claimed was her father's ashes. She says the contents did not look or feel like human ashes. Harold Dillard was a classic Texan ""cowboy"", his daughter says. She was told the company that handled her father's remains had not broken any state laws Bio Care's owner was initially charged with fraud, but the charge was later withdrawn because prosecutors could not prove an intent to deceive. Increasingly desperate, Ms Fasold contacted the local district prosecutor. But she was told that Bio Care had not broken any state criminal laws. Equally as controversial are ""bodies of the state"" donations - when a homeless person dies on the street, or somebody dies in hospital without known next-of-kin, and their corpse is donated to science. In theory, county officials first try to find relatives; only if they cannot locate anyone is the body given away. But the BBC has heard that this may not always happen. Last year, Tim Leggett was scrolling a news app at his home in Texas when he found a list of local people whose bodies had been used in this way. He was shocked to see the name of his older brother, Dale, a forklift truck-operator who had died of respiratory failure a year earlier. His brother's body was used by a for-profit medical education company to train anaesthesiologists. It was one of more than 2,000 unclaimed bodies given to the University of North Texas Health Science Center between 2019 and 2024, under agreements with the Dallas and Tarrant counties. ""I was angry,"" Mr Leggett says. ""He would not want to be an object of discussion, or [to have] people pointing at him."" His brother was a quiet man who mostly ""just wanted to be left alone"", Mr Leggett remembers, and his aversion to technology made it difficult to stay in touch. Still, Mr Leggett says his brother was a human, like anyone else, who deserved dignity in death. ""He liked Marvel comic books; he had a cat that he named Cat,"" he remembers. In a statement to the BBC, the University of North Texas Health Science Center gave its ""deepest apologies"" to the affected families, and said it was ""refocusing"" its programme on education and ""improv[ing] the quality of health for families and future generations"". Since the story first emerged last year, they said, they have fired staff who oversaw the programme. Unfairly villainised? But horror stories like these aside, others point out that body donation plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Ms Schmitt of the University of California says that at the most basic level, bodies are used to teach doctors, or for surgeons to practise complicated operations. Often, it's the first time a medical student works with real flesh and blood - an experience that can't be replicated from a textbook. ""Those students will go on to help people,"" she says. Then there are the cadavers used to help engineer new treatments. Ms Schmitt points to a number of technologies that were only developed, she says, after being tested on bodies. These include knee and hip replacements, robotic surgery, and pacemakers. Bloomberg via Getty Images For many medical students, practising on a dead body is the first time they work with real flesh and blood And some of the private brokers say they are being unfairly villainised. Kevin Lowbrera, who works for one of the big ""body broking"" companies, says its accreditation by the American Association of Tissue Banks means it has to follow guidelines determining how cadavers are treated and stored. Accreditation is voluntary - seven companies have signed up - and a private broker doesn't need it to operate legally. The problem is not with honest companies like his, Mr Lowbrera says - it is with the rogue players. ""There are still programmes out there that are not accredited. I tell people all the time, stay away from them,"" he says. It would be wrong to regulate his whole industry out of existence, he says, because of some bad apples. Beyond the for-profit trade? Virtually everyone I speak to - on all sides of the debate - thinks that more regulation in the US is needed. So, what could that look like? Ms Schmitt, of the University of California, suggests the US could perhaps follow European countries and ban for-profit body broking. She says there are some ""legitimate costs"" that come with processing a body - like spending on transport, and preservative chemicals. It's reasonable for companies to charge for these, she says. But the idea of actually making a profit makes many feel squeamish. ""The ability to sell or profit from human remains I think complicates the altruistic idea of donating for education,"" she says. She suggests the US could emulate its own policy on organ donation - which is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, and prohibits the sale of organs. But the author Ms Kleeman says that if the US banned for-profit body donation tomorrow, there simply wouldn't be enough cadavers to go around. ""If you don't want there to be a trade in these body parts, we need to get a way of more people donating altruistically,"" she says. She urges universities to launch more robust promotional campaigns, asking directly for body donations. ""There isn't the same public awareness campaign as there is for organ donation, for example."" Once this shortage is addressed, she says, then the US could ban for-profit donation. It's also possible that advances in virtual reality (VR) technology mean that cadavers simply won't be needed in the future. A trainee doctor could simply put on a headset and practice on a computer-generated patient. In 2023, Case Western Reserve University became one of the first medical schools in the United States to remove human bodies from its training programme, and replace them with VR models. Real human bodies preserve the ""body's colours and textures, [which] can make it difficult to discern, say, a nerve from a blood vessel"", Mark Griswold, a professor at the school, told the website Lifewire at the time. In contrast, their computer programme ""gives students a crystal clear 3D map of these anatomical structures and their relationships to each other"", he said. But Ms Kleeman says that, in general, VR technology is not yet good enough to replicate practicing on a cadaver. For the time being, it seems, there will remain a demand for human bodies - as well as money to be made.

611ca6cf30fb,Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips,,"Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips Getty Images Posture is all about regular movement, exercise and positive mindsets ""Sit up straight!"" - we've all heard that command barked at us many times. For years we've been told that good posture means standing tall, shoulders back and your spine straight as a rod. But that might not actually be true. According to Dr Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, much of what we think we know about posture is outdated. In fact, trying to hold yourself bolt upright all day could do more harm than good, he told Morning Live . As the end of summer looms and many people return to work and studying, here are his three suggestions to improve your posture and in turn help look after your back. 1. Keep moving Getty Images Raising your arms above your head and moving your head from side to side can release tension Posture is dynamic, not static. The worst thing you can do is stay locked in one position for hours whether that's being perched at a desk, lounging on the sofa or scrolling on your phone. Dr Xand says the key is to change it up. There are lots of posture corrector straps, back braces and chairs that promise to change your life but ""you just need to be moving around in the day"". A lumbar cushion or an ergonomic chair can make sitting more comfortable and a wearable posture reminder might nudge you to stop hunching but none of these replace the basics of movement, strength and listening to your body. ""You can have the best chair, but if you spend eight hours sitting in it you'll still have back pain."" Dr Xand also cautions that some back gadgets marketed as improving posture can force you into one position that constrains and restricts your movement and that's the opposite of what you want to be doing. Make sure you stand, stretch and take regular breaks - even small shifts can reset your muscles, he says. 2. Build strength, not stiffness Getty Images Contrary to what some might think, perfect posture isn't about balancing a book on your head Good posture comes from strong muscles, but that doesn't mean you need a gym membership or Olympic ambitions. Dr Xand suggests regular exercises to build a stronger core and back. Simple movements like raising your arms above your head and turning your head from side to side ""can lift some tension and help you feel instantly better"". ""What we want is for our body to support itself,"" Dr Xand explains. Exercises like pilates and yoga can be a good way to stretch your body and target specific pain points, he says. The NHS website also suggests simple exercises which can be done at home to improve your strength. 3. Change your mindset Getty Images Stress can be a contributing factor to bad posture and back pain Posture isn't just about muscles, it's also about mindset. The way we sit, stand and move often reflects how stressed we're feeling about what we're doing. Hunched shoulders at a laptop can be as much about deadlines as desk set-up so it's important to reflect on your attitude towards work or study. ""Pain is not just about muscles, it's emotional and psychological,"" explains Dr Xand. He says that previously people would be told to focus on their desk set-up without taking into account that pain can be a result of ""stress, the amount of time you're doing your job and whether you do any exercise."" ""Your seat height is important but other facts are also important,"" he adds. So, sometimes fixing your posture is as much about easing your schedule as it is about stretching your spine. In some cases poor posture (not just back pain) can be down to an underlying medical condition and you should check in with your GP if concerned. According to the NHS , if you're suffering from back pain you should try and stay active, take anti-inflammatory medicines and try doing some exercises and stretches. You should see a GP if your back pain doesn't improve after treating it at home for a few weeks or the pain is getting worse over time.

dfa576935b10,Will Serena Williams's weight-loss admission help shed stigma of anti-obesity drugs?,,"Serena Williams, one of the most successful athletes of all time, has spoken out about using weight loss drugs - she says, to lift the ""stigma"" around using such medication. Will her outspoken comments instil a new sense of confidence in those using the drugs? And could her honesty quieten the critics? The 43-year-old tennis star, who broke records and won 23 grand slam titles through her career, was the embodiment of fitness and athletic prowess. But, after having kids, even she, like so many of us, has admitted to struggling to shift those extra pounds. In the end, Williams told the Today Show on TV in the US, that she had to look at her extra weight as ""an opponent"". Despite ""training five hours a day"" and ""running, walking, biking, stair climbing,"" she couldn't pulverise this adversary like she did to her opponents on the tennis court - so in the end, she says, she had no other choice but to ""try something different"". Many of her friends were using GLP-1 - the group of medications which help with weight loss, so she decided to try it. Williams is adamant that the medication route - she won't say which brand she is taking - wasn't easy, and certainly not a shortcut to her losing 31lb (14kg) over the past eight months. There is scepticism about the timing of the tennis star's recent transparency - she has just become a spokesperson for Ro, a company which sells GLP-1 brands like Wegovy and Zepbound (known as Mounjaro in the UK) through its weight-loss programme, and her husband is also an investor. Despite this and the potential side effects of taking the medication, her honesty will hit a nerve for many - she says she is speaking out to take away the shame that so many women feel when it comes to using drugs to help them lose weight. Caleb Luna, assistant professor of feminist studies at the University of California, says having someone like Serena Williams speaking out is ""a breakthrough"". They say it helps silence the critics of how ""weight loss is achieved"" who say that ""people are taking the easy way out"" by using weight loss drugs. ""It gets rid of the stereotype that these drugs are for fat people who are being lazy and incompetent. ""In that respect it's maybe a good thing."" But Caleb also says the revelation about her need to resort to using GLP-1 medication is slightly ""terrifying"" and makes them feel ""a little bit sad"". They worry that all it does is belittle hard work and dedication, instead, focussing on appearance and the pressure to look a certain way. ""She has achieved things that so few people, in our time and throughout history have achieved. ""But now it just shows how all those accomplishments can be undermined by body size. ""Scarily, weight loss seems to outshine all those record-breaking achievements."" Williams's weight and her looks have been scrutinised throughout her life. The burden, the pressure to fit in with society's expectations does not diminish no matter how much sporting success an athlete has in their career. And while she may be the most high profile sports star who openly uses weight loss medication, there are many others in the public eye who have spoken out. Oprah Winfrey says she uses GLP-1 as a tool, along with exercise and healthy eating, to stop herself ""yo-yoing"" with her weight. Actress Whoopi Goldberg says she lost the weight of ""two people"" after taking the drug, and singer Kelly Clarkson, who says she was ""chased"" by her ""doctor for two years"" before she agreed to take it, are among the dozens of stars who have been open about taking the medication. Williams left the world of tennis behind back in 2022, when she played the final match of her career in the US Open, but she is still a powerhouse of strength and has wanted to reach what she describes as her ""healthy weight"" since the birth of her second child, Adira. In her interview with the Today Show, says she felt like her ""body was missing something"" and she wasn't able to get down to what she felt comfortable with - despite intense training. Dr Claire Madigan, a senior research associate in behavioural medicine at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says elite athletes can find it hard to lose weight. ""They are used to consuming a lot of calories and when they leave the sport they can find it difficult - it needs a change in behaviour."" Dr Madigan said  it was good to see that Williams mentioned her weight loss was not just down to the drug - ""she did have to focus on the diet and physical activity"". She added: ""It's great she is talking about how difficult it is to lose weight after having a baby."" But she wonders if Williams's message might be lost and even demotivate some women.  ""The drugs are quite expensive and the average person may think here is an elite athlete, she's got access to the gym, she's got time, she has a nutritionist… and she's had to use GLP-1s"". Dr Madigan also expressed concern that the potential side effects of taking the drugs - which can include gastrointestinal problems like vomiting and diarrhoea, and in rare cases, gallbladder and kidney problems - may not have been widely discussed in the publicity surrounding Williams's announcement. Williams says she did not experience any side effects, and told Women's Health magazine that she is finally seeing the benefits of all her hard work at the gym. ""My joints are a lot better,"" she says, ""I just had my check-up, and the doctor said everything - including my blood sugar levels - looked great."" And, even though, she's no longer breaking new ground on the tennis courts, she is still smashing her own records, with the help, she says of weight loss drugs. She's currently training for a half marathon. ""I am running farther than I ever have,"" she says proudly.

2034b2f67111,Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe?,,"Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe? Jonathan Coffey BBC Panorama BBC Listen to Jonathan read this article. When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. In one, the question of her guilt is settled. She is a monster who murdered seven babies and attempted to murder seven more while she was a nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016. In the other universe, Letby is the victim of a flawed criminal justice system in which unreliable medical evidence was used to condemn and imprison an innocent woman. This is what Letby's barrister Mark McDonald argues. He says he has the backing of a panel of the best experts in the world who say there is no evidence any babies were deliberately harmed. These extremes are both disturbing and bewildering. One of them is wrong - but which? Who should we believe? An alternative version of events The families of the infants say there is no doubt. Letby was convicted after a 10-month trial by a jury that had considered a vast range of evidence. They say Letby's defenders are picking on small bits of evidence out of context and that the constant questioning of her guilt is deeply distressing. I have spent almost three years investigating the Letby case - in that time I have made three Panorama documentaries and cowritten a book on the subject with my colleague Judith Moritz. Yet, if true, the new evidence, presented by Mark McDonald in a series of high-profile press conferences and media releases, is shocking. According to his experts, the prosecution expert medical case is unreliable. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Panorama Barrister Mark McDonald says his panel of leading experts found no evidence that any babies were deliberately harmed Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. That is a good indication of where the strongest medical evidence might lie. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. What really happened to Baby O? Baby O was born in June 2016, one of triplet brothers. At Letby's trial, the jury was told that his death was in part the result of liver injuries, which the prosecution pathologist described as impact-type injuries - similar to those in a car accident. As in other cases for which Letby was convicted, the prosecution said circumstantial evidence also tied her to the crime. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was ""unlikely"" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. ""You can't completely rule out the possibility,"" says the pathologist, who does not want to be identified. ""But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation."" Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? Questions around air embolism Letby was accused of injecting air into the blood of Baby O as well as that of other babies. This, the prosecution said, caused an air bubble and a blockage in the circulation known as air embolism. During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in newborn babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Prosecutors argued that these same skin colour changes were observed in several babies in the Letby case. Reuters In many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He argues that his study was misused. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. In other words, the prosecution was wrong to use skin discolouration as evidence of air embolism. It sounds significant. But is it enough to defeat the air embolism allegations? As with many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut. The prosecution did not rely on skin discolouration alone to make their case for air embolism. And although there have not been any reported cases of skin discolouration in babies where air has entered the circulation via a vein, some critics have argued that the number of reported air embolism cases is small and that the theory is still possible. Andy Rain/ EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Professor Neena Modi believes there is some postmortem evidence of air embolism but this is likely to have occurred during resuscitation (pictured far left, with Professor Shoo Lee far right) To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. ""We know these babies suffered air embolism because of the post-mortem imaging in some of them,"" says Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. The air embolism theory, she said, was ""highly speculative"". But her remarks show the debate is far from settled. The needle theory: another explanation? There has been another explanation for Baby O's death. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. This, he argued, had led to the baby's death. Dr Taylor added: ""I think the doctor knows who they are. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder."" The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: ""Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time."" Julia Quenzler / BBC The needle theory was examined at length during Lucy Letby's trial It was a bombshell claim. But does the evidence support it? One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. Another obvious problem with the needle theory is that it had already been examined at length during Letby's trial. The prosecution pathologist concluded that there was no evidence that a needle had pierced Baby O's liver while he was alive and the paediatric pathologist we spoke to agrees. They told us: ""These injuries weren't caused by a needle. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver."" Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his ""opinion has not substantially changed"". He said the ""needle probably penetrated the liver"" of Baby O, and ""probably accelerated his demise"". Lack of consensus among the experts The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. It would appear that among the experts working with Letby's defence, there is not consensus. Consultant neonatologist Dr Neil Aiton is one of the authors of the original report on which Dr Taylor based his comments. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. However, he also says it was ""pretty clear"" a needle had punctured the liver during resuscitation. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Either the liver ruptured because of a needle or it ruptured spontaneously. Dr Aiton's position appears to be that poor resuscitation caused the baby's liver injuries and whether the rupturing was caused by a needle or not is ""not important"". That is a contrast from what Dr Taylor said in that December press conference. And critics say Dr Aiton's account still does not explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place and why he needed such desperate resuscitation. A summary report from Letby's expert panel appears to back further away from the needle theory. It says a needle ""may have"" punctured the liver. Other experts, including the paediatric pathologist, said that Dr Aiton's observation of hyper-inflated lungs would not explain Baby O's liver injuries. Once again, the case illustrates how difficult it is to distinguish between plausible and implausible claims. The debate around birth trauma Since that press conference, other experts working for Letby's defence team have put forward another theory for Baby O's death. They say his liver injuries were the result of traumatic delivery at the time of birth. Professor Modi says this was a ""highly plausible cause"". But that has been contested from a surprising direction. Dr Mike Hall, a neonatologist, was Lucy Letby's original defence expert and attended court throughout her trial. He has been a staunch critic of her conviction, arguing her trial wasn't fair and that there is no definitive medical evidence that babies were deliberately harmed. Panorama Dr Mike Hall, Letby's original defence expert, says there is no record of a traumatic delivery in Baby O's medical notes However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. He notes that Baby O was born in good condition by caesarean section and there is no record of a traumatic delivery in the baby's medical notes. ""There's still no evidence that anyone did anything deliberately to harm Baby O,"" he adds. ""However, something was going on with Baby O, which we haven't explained. ""We don't know what the cause of this is. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know."" The insulin evidence For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. And yet there appears to be flawed expert evidence on both sides. There were two other cases where the jury returned unanimous verdicts – the cases of Babies F and L. The prosecution argued that both babies had been poisoned with insulin and highlighted blood tests that it said were clear evidence of this. For the prosecution, the insulin cases proved that someone at the Countess of Chester Hospital was harming babies. Letby's defence have, meanwhile, marshalled numerous arguments against the insulin theory. One is that the blood test used - an immunoassay - is inaccurate and should have been verified. But even Letby's experts accept the test is accurate around 98% of the time. Another argument is that premature babies can process insulin differently and that the blood test results are ""within the expected range for pre-term infants"". But the medical specialists we've spoken to are baffled by this claim and say it goes against mainstream scientific understanding. PA For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer Of course, mainstream opinion can be wrong. But it is difficult to tell because Letby's defence team have not shared the scientific evidence. One of the experts behind the report – a mechanical engineer who carries out biomedical research – clarified that his analysis says the blood test results were ""not uncommon"". However, Letby's defence declined to show the BBC the published studies that support this claim. Once again, the claims of both the prosecution and defence are not clear-cut. Ultimately, the question of whether Letby's case should be re-examined by the Court of Appeal now lies with CCRC. They have the task of studying Mark McDonald's expert reports. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning.

c0083b5e9223,Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin?,,"Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images Calm in a can. Relaxation after a few sips. That's what some drinks companies are promising with beverages formulated specifically to help you chill out. Lucy and Serena swear by them. They're good friends who, like many, are juggling careers,  the chaos of having small children, trying to stay fit, and everything else in between. ""These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties,"" Serena says, ""but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it."" Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. ""If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round."" But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. BBC News has spoken to nutritionists and dietitians who are sceptical the small amounts of supplements the drinks contain could really bring about that sense of zen. One psychologist has suggested that we might actually ""create our own calm"" when we set aside time for ourselves with something that feels like a treat. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The ""functional beverage"" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Almost 30% of UK households now buy these functional drinks, Worldpanel by Numerator says. So, what's actually in them that's supposed to help you feel more mellow or give your health a boost? Well, that's where things can get complicated, as each brand takes a different approach. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. But how robust is the evidence for that? It's tricky because there are many studies of varying credibility each suggesting different levels of efficacy. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could ""prevent, treat or cure disease"" were a step too far. Trip told BBC News the ruling related to ""a single page on the website"" and it has made the ""changes requested"". It says it's confident its ingredients permit the use of the word ""calm"" which is ""widely and lawfully used by many brands"". Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. She highlights a growing body of evidence around the funghi Lion's Mane, but says there are no conclusive findings about whether it can have any impact - as yet. ""The research is still very much in its infancy,"" she says. "" In one of the more advanced clinical trials , a small number of participants were given 1800mg  - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks."" Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. The lack of research that includes female participants is partly down to menstrual cycles and fluctuating hormones, making it more ""complicated to track"", Ms Patel explains. But these drinks can make a good alternative to drinking alcohol she says, and she has clients who have made the switch from having a wine or a gin and tonic every night to opening a can of one of these drinks to help them unwind. ""I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option."" Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, ""crack on"", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a ""therapy session or a massage at the end of the month"". ""A trace of Lion's Mane or Ashgawanda in a fizzy drink is not going to make any difference,"" she adds. Emily May, 25, first discovered these drinks at Glastonbury a couple of years ago. She's not overly bothered about trying to reach a state of zen through them - she just likes the taste. ""I'm ADHD,"" Emily says, ""so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down."" TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said There is a fine line between advertising that a product will give you a feeling of calm and quiet, and claiming these kinds of drinks will help with mental health problems. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari says mental health and well-being are ""increasingly conflated"" in the wellness sector, creating a ""toxic mix"". There can be a positive - yet temporary - change in mood and consumers might feel a buzz, she says, not because of the ingredients necessarily, but because ""everything around the experience of the product is real"". ""So you've bought a drink which, let's say, is a little bit pricier than the alternatives in the market. Therefore you make a commitment to sit down quietly and enjoy it nicely,"" she says. ""You look at the branding - which is lovely and calming - you're processing your environment in the moment, and then actually what you're experiencing truly is a calm moment in your otherwise busy day. That's not fake."" And it's that little window of peace that Lucy and Serena yearn for - and for a few minutes a fizzy drink in a can gives them that, whether the science really agrees, or not. BBC News contacted all the brands mentioned in this article. Grass&Co told us it's their mission ""to deliver high-strength natural adaptogen and vitamin-packed blends formulated by experts... which are supported by approved health claims."" Goodrays said it wasn't ""offering a panacea"", but that it was ""certainly offering a healthier alternative"" with the ""best efficacy possible"".

bb01b4d6545d,A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS,,"A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS BBC Tom Parker, 37, broke his leg in a fishing accident three miles off the Devon coast Tom Parker was working alone three miles (4.8km) off the Devon coast when his fishing boat hit a wave and lurched to one side. ""I was pulling one of the ropes and I slipped and fell,"" he says. ""I had this really, really bad pain in my ankle. So much so, I couldn't get up off the floor."" He didn't know it at the time, but Tom, 37, had broken his fibula and badly damaged his ankle ligaments. He somehow hauled in his fishing gear and made it to hospital to get patched up, but months after the accident his wound just wouldn't heal properly. It was only after he turned up at an innovative clinic on the quayside in Brixham that he was put on strong antibiotics and told he needed a second operation. ""Without that service, I would have probably ended up with my leg turning septic and I'm not too sure what would have happened after that,"" he says. Under a 10-year plan, published last month , health officials said the NHS in England needed to undergo a radical shift, away from hospitals to community care, and away from treating sickness to preventing it in the first place. There are already small-scale examples of that approach in action across the country. So what can we learn from the Brixham model and how can the idea of targeted, local care be extended to treat millions more NHS patients? The fishermen's health clinic in Brixham is one of 79 Seafit clinics set up in fishing ports across the UK since 2019 On a clear summer morning a spare room in the trawler agent's offices in Brixham harbour is quickly being converted into a temporary health clinic. Blue screens are dragged across to split up the space: a makeshift reception at the front and then just enough room to cram in two GPs, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, two nurses and someone organising prostate cancer tests. There's a steady line of port workers coming in, from buyers in the fish market next door to crews from the trawlers in the harbour. ""The skippers of the boats and the whole fishing community now know exactly where to find us,"" says Dr James Gunning, the local NHS GP in charge of the clinic that day. ""They're a community that fits into health inequalities, where a population either can't access, or struggles to access, normal NHS services."" Staff working on the project start early in the morning, walking around the docks and coaxing workers off the boats with promises of free health screenings and physio. ""Fishermen don't have nine-to-five jobs, they don't have lunchtime where they can just pop off their fishing boat and to the GP's office, and so it's really important that we take those services to them,"" says Sandra Welch, chief executive of the Seafarers Hospital Society, which runs the initiative along with another charity, the Fishermen's Mission. A pop-up Seafit clinic operates every three months in Brixham and at similar sites at ports across the UK, including Folkestone, Peterhead and Kilkeel in Northern Ireland. Some services have started to expand and now offer skin cancer checks, mobile dental services and access to mental health counselling. Dr James Gunning, a local GP in Brixham, runs the fishermen's health clinic at the port along with a team of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists In its 10-year plan the NHS accepts that those who live in coastal and rural areas are more likely to experience worse health outcomes and to die younger. Seaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs, while at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving staffing gaps where they are needed most. An analysis of hospital statistics by the BBC suggests NHS trusts in England treating coastal communities tend to have higher than average wait times for both emergency care and appointments booked in advance, like surgery. The answer, according to NHS bosses and the Westminster government, is to shift as much treatment as possible out of those expensive hospitals. Under the 10-year plan a network of 300 neighbourhood health centres will be opened across England , starting in areas with the lowest healthy life expectancy. The sites, which should eventually be open 12 hours a day, six days a week, will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, social care workers, pharmacists, mental health specialists and other medics. The big idea, as with the Brixham fishermen's clinic, is to better tailor health services to local communities, and offer people more checks and tests to stop them falling sick in the first place. Much of this might feel very familiar. Similar ambitions were set out by ministers in 2019, 2015 and even by the Blair government back in the early 2000s. ""Despite being the right aim, none of those truly delivered,"" says Luisa Pettigrew, a GP and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation think tank. ""Moving money out of hospitals and into community services is hard to do. You need the upfront investment and the results might not be visible for five or 10 years, in some cases longer."" Healthcare unions have also questioned how the new centres will be staffed, saying doctors ""must not be moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder"". Rob Caunter, 66, was diagnosed with prostate cancer after being given a blood test at the fishermen's clinic in Brixham The medics working in Brixham though are convinced their local, preventative approach can benefit not just the fishing community but the wider health service. ""We've managed to find new diabetic patients who otherwise may have gone on to develop more serious disease,"" says Dr Gunning. ""We've picked out others with cardiovascular disease, and those with high blood pressure. So we would certainly hope we can prevent more costly illness from developing."" Rob Caunter, who finally retired from the fish market this year, is just finishing his radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. The 66-year-old, who has a family history of the disease, was diagnosed after staff at the clinic convinced him to take a blood test. ""I was gobsmacked really because I didn't think there was anything wrong with me,"" he says. ""If I never went for the checks, I don't think I would be here today. So it was a real godsend for them to come down to the quay."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

8ae1892ec3da,What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated?,,"What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated? Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images Calamine lotion can be used to help relieve the itchiness of chickenpox spots Young children in the UK will soon be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. It will be added to the list of standard childhood vaccinations from January 2026, and there will be a catch-up programme for older children. What is chickenpox and how can you catch it? Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) . The virus is transmitted through direct contact between people, or through airborne droplets in coughs and sneezes. It is very easy to catch, especially if you've never had it before. While it mostly affects children - around half have had it by their fourth birthday - people of any age can get it. What are the symptoms of chicken pox and what does the rash look like? Getty Images The first symptoms include a fever, muscle aches and pains and generally feeling unwell. A couple of days later, an itchy, spotty rash appears. These red or pink dots can appear anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth. Some children might have only a few spots, but others can be covered from head to toe. The spots fill up with fluid and become blisters before crusting over to form scabs, which eventually drop off and clear up. You are contagious and can spread chickenpox to other people from two days before the first spots develop until they have all formed scabs, which is usually five days after they first appear. How dangerous is chickenpox? Most cases in children are mild, although they will feel unwell and will need to miss school or nursery for several days. Some children will go on to develop complications. In rare cases chicken pox can cause a swelling of the brain, called encephalitis; an inflammation of the lungs, called pneumonitis; and stroke, which can result in hospitalisation and - very rarely - death. Chickenpox is often more serious in very young infants and adults. It can be dangerous in pregnancy, causing complications in both the mother and the baby. Can you get chickenpox twice? How will the chickenpox vaccine work and who can get it? You can already get the chickenpox vaccine privately in the UK, at a cost of up to £200. But experts say adding the varicella vaccine to the official NHS childhood immunisation programme will dramatically reduce the number of people who catch chickenpox, leading to far fewer serious cases. The vaccine doesn't guarantee lifetime immunity, but it does greatly reduce the risk of someone developing chickenpox or having a bad case. Serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare. From January 2026, children will be automatically offered two doses at 12 and 18 months of age. They will get the combined MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. It is a live vaccine which means it contains a weakened version of the chickenpox virus. As such, it is not recommended for those with a compromised immune system because of an illness like HIV or as a result of treatment such as chemotherapy. The move will bring the UK into line with other countries which already offer routine varicella vaccination, including Germany, Canada, Australia and the US. It had previously been thought that vaccinating children against chickenpox would cause a problematic rise in shingles, but a recent long-term study from the US disproved that theory. The committee which advises the government on vaccinations - the JCVI - recommended that all children be given the MMRV in November 2023 . It also suggested that there should be a temporary catch-up programme for slightly older children who will just miss out. Details of this are expected in due course. The decision to vaccinate against chickenpox was announced as new data revealed none of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the 95% uptake target in 2024/25. Some 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, according to the UK Health Security Agency. What is shingles and is there a vaccine? You cannot catch shingles. It is an extremely painful condition that can develop years after a chickenpox infection. That is because when people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body and can be reactivated later, which causes shingles. This might happen, for example, if your immune system is weakened because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy. For many, it's a painful skin rash - usually on the chest or abdomen - on one side of the body. Medicine (antiviral tablets) can help to speed up recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for: people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023 people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated people aged 50+ with a severely weakened immune system You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before. If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0rnqj52y5o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4209/live/2447a060-826f-11f0-a832-3d1a9236e27e.jpg,2025-08-29T11:51:59.331000+00:00,cd6132626fe51ff5d8372f998116090972c38981
e0d84b8c5b3c,Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts,,"Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images A growing number of US teenagers are using caffeine pouches to get an energy rush, say experts who worry the trend could soon take off in the UK. The small teabag-like pouches, placed between the lip and gum, deliver a quick caffeine hit, straight to the bloodstream. Some social media influencers are pushing products, recommending them to gym-goers for performance or to students who want to be alert for exams. TikTok Shop sells lots of brands and flavours that could appeal to young people, says Dr Rob van Dam from George Washington University. But with a single pouch containing as much caffeine as two cups of regular coffee, it could be easy to take too much and get bad side effects, he says. There is already growing concern in the UK about young people using nicotine pouches or snus . Caffeine pouches are also discreet - you may not be able to tell if someone has one in their mouth - making it easy to hide from parents and teachers. Some fans of the product boast online about ""buzzing"" from using two pouches at once for an extra big caffeine rush. As caffeine is rapidly absorbed, the effects may begin minutes after ingestion and last for a number of hours. Levels can go out of control. Dr van Dam told BBC News: ""Young people may have less tolerance to caffeine and there's a chance they could end up in the emergency room if they have too much."" Why caffeine and what happens if you have too much? Getty Images Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more alert and less sleepy due to its effect on the brain and nervous system. Lewis James, from the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says there is good evidence that caffeine can help make exercise feel easier. It's become one of the most regularly used supplements among athletes. As you exercise your body produces a chemical called adenosine which makes you feel tired. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue. But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky. High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine. Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. Generally, up to 400mg of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee. Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: ""High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women"". Watch for other drinks or food that contain caffeine Dr van Dam says it can be easy to overload. Caffeine is found in many drinks and some foods, so it is important to check how much you are consuming. ""While it's harder to overdose on coffee, with these products it's easier, especially if young people are using energy drinks too."" He says some products, when you check them in the laboratory, contain more caffeine than they claim on the labelling. Getty Images Coffee : a mug contains about 100-140mg of caffeine, but it can vary widely Tea : a mug contains about 75mg Energy drinks : often contain 80mg in a 250ml can Soft drinks : typically contains about 40mg per can Chocolate : there is around 25mg of caffeine in a 50g bar of dark chocolate and around 10mg in a 50g bar of milk chocolate Dentists say using them over time can irritate the gums - similar to snus and nicotine pouches . Some experts worry caffeine pouches could be a gateway to using these. Bini Suresh is head of dietetics at the Cleveland Clinic, London, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. She says using pouches may feel ""trendy"" or harmless, but there's a real risk of normalising stimulant use in teens and young adults, potentially creating patterns of dependency. She told the BBC: ""While caffeine may give a temporary boost, it can disrupt sleep and worsen fatigue over time, especially in children and teens who are more sensitive to its effects."" If young people are going to have caffeine, the BDA and NHS both advise caution. The European Food Safety Authority suggests 3mg/kg body weight as the upper limit for children and adolescents, meaning a child weighing 30kg should have no more than 90mg in a day. Instead of reaching for caffeine, Ms Suresh says it's far better to focus on regular meals, hydration and nutrient-rich foods that support steady energy levels throughout the day. A healthy diet with enough iron, protein and slow-releasing carbohydrates should do the job, she says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8k8xgry98o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5233/live/cdedb4b0-6e97-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg,2025-08-01T00:06:06.293000+00:00,faa51bba819679dc41cb03cfb5e028a5230a1985
357df2b2c383,"Sleep, exercise, hydrate - do we really need to stick to recommended daily doses?",,"Sleep, exercise, hydrate - do we really need to stick to recommended daily doses? Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter Getty Images It felt like there was a collective sigh of relief when a study, published this week, suggested 10,000 steps a day isn't the health utopia we had all been led to believe. The news that we only had to reach 7,000 steps was enough to quite literally stop us in our fervent step-counting stride. So what about some of the other health targets that many of us swear by? Can we fall short of the mark but still live long, healthy and happy lives? We've taken a handful of commonly cited healthy lifestyle benchmarks, examined them with various experts to get an idea of why they exist, explored the health claims, and, most importantly asked if there is any wriggle room. Is sleep so important that we have to spend so much of our lives doing it? How much exercise is enough? What about drinking water? How much do we really need? Disclosure - the below is not medical advice, it's more of an inspection of many of the health ideals we have on our radar. Water (6-8 glasses a day) Getty Images According to the NHS, the average grown-up should be drinking between six and eight glasses (1.5-2 litres) of water a day . However, maybe we don't need to cart our fancy flagons around with us as much as we thought. Prof Neil Turner, kidney specialist at the University of Edinburgh, says as humans we existed for thousands of years without knowing what a pint or a litre was. ""I mean, mice don't need flashing water bottles telling them how much to drink - why do we?"" he says. ""Our bodies are set up to do things just right - we eat when we are hungry, we breathe when we need to breathe, and we drink when we are thirsty."" Oh. Is it really that simple? According to Prof Turner, who has seen a lot of kidneys in his time, that rule applies to the vast majority of us. Those with specific conditions, like a kidney disorder, may have to drink more. He says if our urine is dark, in the general healthy population, we shouldn't panic that we haven't drunk enough - that is the kidney doing its job. It is reserving water in our body, he explains, and our body should tell us that we feel thirsty and then we will get a drink. Dr Linia Patel, a performance nutritionist, disagrees. We might drink different amounts, she says, due to factors like our size, how warm we are, whether we've been drinking alcohol, but she feels having a target of 1.5 to 2 litres is a good thing - especially for women. ""I would definitely say from a women's health point of view, where I work, what I see is a lot of the symptoms [associated] with being dehydrated. It might be fatigue, constipation, brain fog, feeling hungry [or] cravings."" She says that if the problem is related to hydration then it's ""an easy one to get right, if you're consistent with it"". Sleep (7-9 hours a night) Getty Images Moving on to sleep - the NHS recommends seven to nine hours a night for the average adult, and there's not much wriggle room to be had there. Prof Ama Johal, a specialist in sleep disorders from Queen Mary University of London, says sleep is vital; without it we are beginning to shave years off our lives. ""The evidence is there, there are huge bodies of research which show that the health benefits are multiple. ""A good night's sleep - that's at least seven hours of quality sleep - reduces the risk  of obesity, diabetes, depression and finally, it lowers mortality rates."" He points to a study which used 10,000 British civil servants - those that slept for fewer than five hours a night had an increased risk of early death. But could we shave an hour off the minimum recommended - and settle for six hours a night? ""No,"" Prof Johal says. ""As soon as we lower the limit then there's a risk people will think it's ok to sleep for less time."" Cat napping? ""Unfortunately not,"" he says, ""Our bodies have very different reactions to naps through the day, and eventually if we tried to make up the hours we were missing overnight by sleeping through the day, we would struggle to fall asleep at night."" But all is not lost, nappers among us - there are studies that suggest a short snooze in the day can keep the brain youthful, and even compensate for poor or broken sleep the night before. Prof Johal suggests that for those who struggle to get the recommended amount, try to target a few nights of good sleep a week, and just being ""more aware that sleep is so important"". Emily & Lucy Emily Thornton and Lucy Hird - active walkers, but they struggle to sleep Emily and Lucy are two avid walkers from Manchester. But alongside their love of walking, the two women share a less healthy trait: they struggle to nod off because of their anxiety. But they say the target of seven hours sleep a night is something they ""are working towards"". Exercise (150 mins a week) Emily and Lucy are, however, ""definitely nailing it"" when it comes to exercise. Through their group, Soft Girls who Hike, they have found a love of walking which has not only improved their mental health, they say, but connected them with many other women. They don't try to meet all the healthy benchmarks on their radar, they explain, because ""life just gets in the way"". But they are doing 7,000 steps a day and taking long, low impact walks at the weekend. The Chief Medical Officer recommends doing 150 minutes of exercise a week and two strength training sessions. Is that achievable for most? Dr Sinead Roberts, a sports nutritionist who trains elite athletes, is pragmatic in her approach. While moderate strength training and physical activity are vital for maintaining muscle mass, she says, as well as resistance to injuries and supporting our immune systems, you have to adapt the recommendations to fit with your life. ""Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise people,"" she says. ""This phrase really does apply here. ""I have friends who do nothing - and that really does show, I say, 'You're walking like an 80-year-old!' ""But if you are doing one strength session a week and some moderate exercise then that is definitely a good thing, just try and do more if you can."" She uses an analogy of a highway - the more things we can do to stay healthy the wider the road, which, in turn means we can go off course sometimes without careering up a grassy verge. ""All those benchmarks are interlinked - you can't just do one healthy thing and ignore the rest. Equally you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself to achieve them all."" This attitude chimes with Emily and Lucy, who say they happily ""chip away"" at some of the health benchmarks. ""For example, we might do five minutes of meditation [which is] better than nothing, but we wouldn't stress about not hitting the recommended goal."" Mindfulness (10 mins a day) Getty Images Through its Every Mind Matters campaign, the NHS recommends 10 minutes of mindfulness a day. Basically, instead of pondering the future or thinking about the past, you pay attention to the moment, noticing what is going on inside and outside ourselves, letting our thoughts pass by without judgement. Some studies suggest activities like mindfulness can have a positive effect and also help change the structure of the brain. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari, founder of The Veda Group, says 10 minutes is a good start to ""give the mind time to settle, and the brain enough time to truly benefit"" from the process of mindfulness. But many of us lead busy lives, and to carve out 10 minutes in the day can be a luxury. In some respects, could having these targets make life more stressful? Ms Tiwari disagrees - it's less about the time spent and more about the awareness of mindfulness and bringing it to our everyday lives. ""Even brief pauses,"" she explains, ""can still have a positive impact"". Most experts I've spoken to agree that while benchmarks are useful, and simplicity is key, it's better not to fixate on a number. Rather, find a way to incorporate a healthy outlook to diet, exercise and mental health into everyday life. After sitting for some time writing this, I am going to sign off - there is another health benchmark I've just come across: limiting sitting down to less than eight hours a day. So, I had better get moving.

a84975956de4,Ketamine helped me escape my negative thoughts - then it nearly killed me,,"Ketamine helped me escape my negative thoughts - then it nearly killed me Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter, BBC News Abbie Abbie first began using ketamine when she was 16 Abbie was 16 years old when she started using ketamine. It was the first time she had felt in control. The negative thoughts that had swamped her mind since a young age began to dissipate. Twelve years later and fresh out of rehab she's still battling with the addiction that almost took her life. She wants to speak out to explain why ketamine has become such a popular drug - especially among young people with mental health problems - and to talk about the damage it can do long term. Abbie's warning comes as the first NHS clinic in the UK - dedicated to helping children struggling with ketamine use - opens on Merseyside , with patients as young as 12 needing help. Ketamine is unlike many other street drugs due to the way it interacts with the brain. Small amounts of the Class B drug can give a sense of euphoria and excitement, while large amounts can lead to a state known as the ""K-hole,"" where users feel detached from reality - an out-of-body-type experience. The number of under 16s reporting a problem with the drug has nearly doubled over the past two years, overtaking cocaine in popularity with children and young people. Nearly half those (49%) who started treatment for drug misuse in 2023-24 said they had a mental health problem, with more than a quarter not receiving any treatment for the latter. Details of help and support with addiction are available in the UK at BBC Action Line Experts are warning that some young people are taking dangerous amounts of ketamine not only due to its low price and ease of availability, but also because of the dissociative feelings it brings. ""What we are seeing is a perfect storm,"" David Gill, the founder of Risk and Resilience, a company which trains front-line workers on emerging drug trends. ""We have more young people struggling with depression, trauma, anxiety, a lack of services - and we have a very cheap street drug that helps them disconnect."" Abbie's first line of ketamine did exactly that. She says it ""felt like such a powerful place to be"". ""My thoughts no longer had a negative effect on me - life was passing me by, but I didn't have to engage with it."" Abbie's childhood had been hard. Struggling with mental health problems and undiagnosed ADHD, she had left school at 14 and found herself in a whirlwind of drink, drugs and unhealthy relationships. Abbie Abbie's weight dropped during the course of her addiction Although addiction cast a long shadow throughout her 20s, Abbie managed to  secure a place at university, staying clean throughout, and obtained a healthcare degree. She is smart, articulate and wants to do well, but after two abusive and controlling relationships ketamine became the only means she had to block out the trauma. Yet when she went to her GP to seek help she was prescribed sleeping tablets and told to ""come off the ket"". ""The withdrawals were so bad I would be shaking and vomiting,"" she says, ""it wasn't that easy to just come off it."" Then a deeper level of addiction took hold. ""I always prided myself in the early stages of addiction of keeping my morals and my values and not lying to people,"" Abbie says, ""but I couldn't stop the drugs and I found myself hiding my use to my friends."" Things escalated. Eventually Abbie was taking ketamine every day - incessantly. The only time she would take a shower, she says, would be when she went out to meet her dealer on the street. The physical effects of overuse began to kick in - horrific abdominal pains, known as K-cramps, would leave her screaming in agony. She would place boiling hot water bottles on her abdomen - burning her skin. And then she would take even more ketamine to numb the pain. What is ketamine? Often referred to as ket, Special K or just K, ketamine is a powerful horse tranquilliser and anaesthetic. It is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically When misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder It is currently a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 The penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine - or both Abbie documents her recovery on TikTok and gives support to other young people This cycle of drug abuse is something public health consultant Professor Rachel Isba also sees in her new clinic for under 16s experiencing the physical side effects of ketamine use. Chronic use of the drug can cause ketamine-induced uropathy, a relatively new condition, which affects the bladder, kidneys and liver. The bladder lining becomes so inflamed it can result in permanent damage and it has to be removed. Prof Isba says the first signs of ketamine bladder are severe abdominal pains, urinating blood and jelly from the damaged bladder lining. ""Patients referred to the clinic will receive a holistic approach,"" she says, ""care from the specialist urology team to treat the physical effects of the drug, and then they will be supported - and referred if necessary -  to community services who can help with the often complex reasons behind their drug use."" 'Completely helpless' Maisie Maisie started taking ketamine at festivals - but her use spiralled out of control Sarah Norman, from St Helens, says she felt like a ""silent watcher"" as her daughter began to ""fade in front"" of her eyes. Last September she discovered that Maisie, 25, was addicted to ketamine, which had caused potentially irreversible damage to her kidneys. ""We are just an average family,"" Sarah says. ""I never thought Maisie would have ended up addicted to any drugs - she doesn't even drink alcohol."" Maisie had kept it quiet - ashamed of the stigma attached to her ketamine use. But what had started as a party drug she'd take at festivals had become a substance she couldn't function without. In the end her partner moved out with their three-year-old son. ""I had nothing left to live for,"" Maisie says. ""It got to the point I was doing bump after bump [snorting small amounts of it]. ""For a short time I would be knocked out of reality - then I would take more."" Sarah Norman Sarah documents her daughter's addiction and offers advice to other parents online Eventually, Maisie's mum and sister carried her into hospital - she weighed just five stone (32kg). ""The doctors said her body was failing her,"" Sarah says. ""We thought we might lose her."" As a parent, she says, she felt completely helpless. ""It's hell on earth, there is nothing you can do. You ask yourself what you should have done."" Maisie's kidneys were fitted with nephrostomy tubes, which drain the urine out into two bags - which she now carries around with her. Yet even this major operation didn't end Maisie's addiction. But finally, after fighting for a place in rehab she has now been clean for five months. Sarah posts about her daughter's drug journey on Tik Tok where many parents reach out to her for help and advice with their own children. ""This drug is just horrific, so many other young people are struggling with it,"" Sarah says. ""I am so proud of Maisie though, she's going to Narcotics Anonymous meetings every night. ""The pain she must have been through - and still goes through - I'm not sure if I'd have been as resilient and strong as she is."" Maisie Maisie's kidneys were badly damaged and she needed two tubes fitted to drain the urine Abbie was rejected from NHS rehabilitation services twice, and reached a point where she considered taking her own life. ""There was so much chaos around me and the services weren't going to help me, I just wanted to end it all,"" she says. But after sending a five-page letter to the panel that decides on eligibility she finally managed to access a detox and rehabilitation service. ""I had three choices,"" Abbie says, ""rehab, section - or in a coffin."" Abbie was treated in the same rehabilitation unit as Maisie. She is now out, clean and proud of herself but says the treatment she received failed to deal with her trauma. ""I can look after myself on a daily basis and I'm doing OK. The real work starts now I'm out of rehab,"" she says, "" and now I am clean, hopefully I can get the mental health support I so desperately needed when I was using."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said that as part of its 10 Year Health Plan to reform the NHS, it was going to be much ""bolder in moving from sickness to prevention"". ""This government is driving down the use of drugs like ketamine, ensuring more people receive timely treatment and support, and making our streets and communities safer.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70r1xdyy59o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4173/live/46c9e340-58e0-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg,2025-07-04T23:08:50.405000+00:00,25ec3065046a252f15c87732b3851f06511b17c8
5b36514efb65,The English neighbourhood that claims to hold the secret to fixing the NHS,,"The English neighbourhood that claims to hold the secret to fixing the NHS Nick Triggle Health correspondent BBC Listen to this article on BBC Sounds Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the ""broken"" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low. Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every £100 spent on community care would otherwise cost £131 for hospital care. This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service. Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof. Washwood Heath clinic brings together hospital staff, GPs, mental health teams, social care workers and charities under one roof The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support. In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing. The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital. ""We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,"" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. ""The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own – it requires partnership working."" Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a ""pioneering service"" and he is firm that the model could ""be the future of the NHS"". However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale. A model system to unblock beds? In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out. One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes. Nurse Dani Fullerton delayed retirement to work at the centre The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home. ""Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,"" says nurse Dani Fullerton. ""It's so different from anything I have done before."" Tackling loneliness to save money One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers. Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than £9,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity. So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too. ""We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,"" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled. ""The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks."" Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding. At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand. Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour. ""Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually."" Dr Subeena Suleman: ""It meant we had more time for other patients"" Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months. ""It meant we had more time for other patients,"" says Dr Suleman. ""We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it."" In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%. However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city. The knock-on effect for hospitals The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions. So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job. Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service. This, he says, worked far better for him. ""I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns."" Christopher Thomas believes his chronic lung disease was caused by asbestos exposure as a builder Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. ""Here we can see and test patients quickly – there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results."" But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital. Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds. The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people. Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic. Getty Images Birmingham has a network of large health centres but many places don't There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than £100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff. Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. ""We believe this is the right model,"" he insists. But there is a catch. As he puts it, ""It only works when the whole system buys into it."" Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder. ""People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,"" she says. But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources. The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, ""been a bit cynical"". ""The problem is that it takes time to get results – you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact."" Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not. This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs. ""There just isn't enough of the right premises,"" he argues. ""In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped. ""We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?"" Political pressure and short-term thinking There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge. Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007. Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. ""We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale."" And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first. Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets. ""It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,"" he observes. So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic. ""It can,"" he says. ""But it will take determination, effort – and money.""

9d30631a4465,Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping?,,"Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping? Peter Dazeley/ Getty Creative Disposable vapes have been found to damage the environment From Sunday, it will be illegal for businesses to sell or supply disposable vapes. The government hopes the ban will reduce environmental damage caused by the devices and help cut the number of children and young people vaping. How are the rules about vapes changing? Disposable vapes ban From 1 June 2025 , businesses will be banned from selling or supplying any single-use vapes , whether that's in shops or online. Retailers caught breaking the law in England face a minimum £200 fine, with a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences. Penalties are broadly similar in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Trading Standards will be able to seize any single-use vapes they find. Only devices considered to be reusable will be legal. That means that they must have a rechargeable battery, a replaceable coil, and be refillable. It won't be illegal to own a disposable vape after 1 June. Customers can still return them, and retailers have an obligation to get rid of them. Vaping tax Vaping products are already subject to 20% VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not currently attract a separate additional tax. A new vaping duty will start on 1 October 2026 . It will be charged at a flat rate of £2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive for cigarette smokers to switch to vaping. Advertising and sponsorship ban The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - will outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship. It will also restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. Children have been targeted with colours, branding and flavours such as bubble gum or candy floss , to push a product that can lead to nicotine addiction, the British Medical Association has warned. Illegal vapes The government is also cracking down on iIlegal vapes, which are widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. More than six million illegal vaping products were seized by Trading Standards officers across England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC. Why are disposable vapes so bad for the environment? The ban on disposable vapes was introduced to tackle their impact on the environment. Almost five million single-use vapes were thrown away each week in 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). As well as lithium-ion batteries, vapes also contain circuit boards. If these aren't not disposed of properly, they can leak toxic compounds such as cobalt and copper. That means fish, and marine mammals could mistake vapes for food and ingest poisonous chemicals. The Local Government Association (LGA), also says that single-use vapes are ""a hazard for waste and litter collection and cause fires in bin lorries "". However, recycling disposable vapes is not straightforward because of their size and the way they are manufactured, which makes them difficult to take apart. These minerals and the lithium could - if recovered - be reused for green technologies such as electric car batteries or in wind turbines. There is currently no large-scale disposable vape recycling in the UK. There are so many different types of vape on the market that it is difficult to develop a standard recycling process. How many children and adults vape? Around 18% of 11 to 17-year-olds (980,000 children) have tried vaping , according to a 2024 survey by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health). About 7% (390,000 children) said they currently vaped, down from 8% in 2023, but still well above the 4% figure recorded in 2020. In contrast, just over 5% of 11 to 17-year-olds (280,000 children) said they currently smoked, while just under 3% (150,000 children) said they both smoked and vaped. Among all age groups over 16, the use of vapes has risen, with about 5.1 million people using a vape or e-cigarette in 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 5.9% of people aged 16 and over vaped every day, up slightly from the previous year, while another 3.9% did so occasionally. The group with the highest rate of vape use - nearly 16% - was 16-24 year-olds. Getty The NHS says vaping should only be for adults quitting smoking How harmful are vapes to children and adults? Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes, which contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and is one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK. But because vaping may itself cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains, it is only recommended for adult smokers trying to quit as part of the NHS ""swap to stop"" programme. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. ""Vapes can be an effective way for adult smokers to quit - but we have always been clear that children and adult non-smokers should never vape,"" the Department of Health and Social Care has said. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of vaping, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned ""alarming evidence"" was growing about the damage it causes. In February 2025, the government said a £62m research project would track 100,000 eight to 18-year-olds for a decade to better understand the risks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyny0w7wdo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d8e4/live/520e8480-3aff-11f0-ab2d-a33f931f78dd.jpg,2025-05-30T09:37:32.888000+00:00,e4c9b4b7e8740c7605f54107af850280560d662b
1ca793eb1cc4,Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma,,"Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma Faisal Islam Economics editor BBC In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers. Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests. The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness. At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine. Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce. The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness. In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return. Mapping welfare trends The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. ""Cluster analysis maps"" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are. As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed. The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules. Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population. The data has thrown up answers. That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits. But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill? If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work? Growing sickness When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work. ""There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,"" Qam told me. GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are ""fit for work"". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as ""not fit for work"". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence. From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was £28bn in the year before the pandemic, is now £52bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit £70bn by the end of the decade. The pure financial aim here is to ""bend the curve"" down to nearer £60bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients. 'Deaths of despair' An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million. Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra ""deaths of despair"" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic. Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the ""incredibly low"" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years. About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality. The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health. But then there is the question of how to address it. Overly binary Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses. Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work. This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a ""hard boundary"" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment. PA Media Liz Kendall is expected to announce plans to cut £5-6bn a year from the welfare budget This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals. History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt. But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour. The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims. Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about ""three million unemployed"". A middle ground The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits. This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were ""deeply unfair"" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme ""could not be repeatedly salami-sliced"". PA Media There is an ""overdiagnosis"" of mental health conditions, the Health Secretary has said Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program. Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics. Prevention rather than cure With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure. And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support. Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%. The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts. And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping? Faster cuts The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change. Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary. Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts. That's because all of this is in the context of what ""fiscal headroom"" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending. Shutterstock It is currently unclear whether planned cuts could affect Personal Independence Payments But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. ""We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,"" a source told me. ""Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous."" Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work. And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs. That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.

146aea72d6f7,First place in British Isles set to approve right to die,,"First place in British Isles set to approve right to die Dominic Hughes Health Correspondent, Douglas, Isle of Man Getty Images The Isle of Man could be the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Man's lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: Be terminally ill and ""reasonably expected"" to die within 12 months Be over the age of 18 Be registered with an Isle of Man GP Have the legal capacity to make the decision Have the decision verified by two independent doctors The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the island's parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. 'A long and careful process' Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. ""The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process,"" Dr Allinson says. ""It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death."" Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. Getty Images Two independent doctors will have to approve the wishes of a person with a terminal illness who wants to access the assisted dying scheme on the Isle of Man How does the Isle of Man legislation differ from the Westminster bill? The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed. That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs. Meanwhile, the legislation being proposed in Jersey has very similar restrictions to the Westminster plans. However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law. A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced. As a GP on the Isle of Man, Dr Martin Rankin is worried about the dangers of coercion Some doctors fear the legislation will be a ""slippery slope"" that will see the scope of the laws extended. Isle of Man GP Dr Martin Rankin is a member of the Medical Society and is worried about the dangers of coercion, where vulnerable people are pressured to end their lives early. ""The safeguards that are in place on this one, I'm not going to know if somebody has been coerced by a relative into ending their life sooner than they wish. ""So I really won't be getting involved in it."" Millie Blenkinsop-French has campaigned for assisted dying legislation for years, but saw her own son James die from cancer However, there have been some passionate campaigners who have spent years fighting for this legislation. Millie Blenkinsop-French lost her son James to neck cancer, aged only 52. It was a very difficult, painful death that cemented her belief in assisted dying for the terminally ill. ""Nobody in their right mind would be against assisted dying if they had to sit, like I did, and watch my son die. ""I wish with all my heart and soul that assisted dying had been in then, I really do, because he would have opted for it. He wasn't a stupid boy, he was a very intelligent young man. ""And it'll give an awful lot of people the chance that James didn't have, give an awful lot of people the chance to say, you know, 'enough is enough, let me pass over'."" The Isle of Man legislation now looks set to become law, but as politicians in Jersey, Westminster and Holyrood also consider their own proposals, the wider debate about assisted dying is far from over.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ed70qep7o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/495e/live/57f3a220-f2bd-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.jpg,2025-02-25T13:02:21.388000+00:00,a0de610c9dfe5efb5dde090e0ef5ce8bd98368ae
687de3d10465,Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people,,"Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people Jane Deith BBC File on 4 Investigates and Jill Collins BBC Listen to Jane read this article At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. ""You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,"" he says. ""You'd die."" He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. ""Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,"" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. ""We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,"" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. Getty Images Lancashire County Council says it is supporting a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine – also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it. Getty Images Ketamine gained attention after the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry, with a coroner ruling it as the primary cause Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence. But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that. 'It's in the schools, it's in the parks' One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told. The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died. Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. ""The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',"" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. ""It's in the schools, it's in the parks."" Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. ""What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,"" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. ""Sometimes the parents have no idea."" Getty Images Once known as a party drug linked to club culture, ketamine use now appears to be shifting Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to ""chill"" in the local parks or at home. Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so ""to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma"", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University. 'Everybody else is doing it' One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps. Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine. ""I knew it was illegal… and it was a horse tranquiliser,"" says Lexi. ""That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out."" One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. ""It were easy to get – like, really easy,"" she says. Getty Images Many young people are turning to ketamine because it is affordable and easy to buy, according to Lexi In Burnley, friends will chip in for the £15 to £30 it costs for a gram and share it. To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a £10 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: ""I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?"" 'You're doing stupid amounts' What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity. At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. ""The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,"" she adds. ""If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them."" And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16. ""Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,"" he says. Soon he was spending £200 month on the drug. Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, ""which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed"", says Mrs Wilson. Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable. 'Extremely dangerous' Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine ""may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help"", warns Prof Ralphs. The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. ""Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,"" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. ""It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision."" Joe Frost Families in Burnley are calling for more support to tackle what Fr Frost describes as a ketamine ""epidemic"" Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an ""epidemic"" of ketamine use. In response, Lancashire County Council says it is ""dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community"" and that it ""will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need"". 'The urge is always there' There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue. ""It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,"" says Insp Plummer. ""You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids."" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged. And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification ""will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet"". In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering. Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine. Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, ""the urge is always there for me to do it again"".

afa88c43ce66,Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law?,,"Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law? Michelle Roberts Digital health editor, BBC News Getty Images MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements: They must be resident of England and Wales and be registered with a GP for at least 12 months They must have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure They must be expected to die within six months They must make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed (by them or a proxy on their behalf), about their wish to die Two independent doctors must be satisfied the person is eligible - and there must be at least seven days between the doctors’ assessments A High Court judge must hear from at least one of the doctors and can also question the dying person, or anyone else they consider appropriate. There must be a further 14 days after the judge has made the ruling (although this can be shortened to 48 hours in some circumstances) The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with ""training, qualifications and experience"" at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary Under the bill, a doctor could prepare the ""approved"" substance (the bill does not detail what medication this is) but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. The doctor would stay with the person until they had self-administered the substance and died (or the doctor determines the procedure has failed). The person could decide not to take it, in which case the doctor would have to remove the substance immediately. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient. Deaths covered by the assisted suicide bill would not need to be investigated by a coroner. But the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years. What's not included in the bill is how much the system would cost , who would pay and what the workload would be. And there is no detail about the judicial process - namely, how the evidence would be put before the High Court judge. Lord Thomas, former Lord Chief Justice, told the BBC's Today Programme that it cannot be a ""rubber stamping process"" and judges must be satisfied there is no coercion.

To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they'd known beforehand. How did you feel beforehand? Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. ""I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,"" she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more ""comfortable and casual"", she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening ""for at least two years"" because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Bianca Ionici Bianca Ionici delayed her cervical screening because of concerns about pain Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be ""uncomfortable and painful"". But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn't find this to be the case. What did the test feel like? Jessica Tse was ""really anxious"" before her cervical screening in December. ""I didn't know if it was going to hurt"", she says. But the nurse was ""talking to me, distracting me throughout"" and explained the procedure ""really clearly"", she adds. ""Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn't felt before,"" Bianca recalls. But ""it was over before I knew"", she says. Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. ""It was nothing,"" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. ""I couldn't feel anything."" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. Megan Burns Megan says that the fact she'd had two children made her cervical screening seem much less daunting ""These nurses have seen everything,"" Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says ""you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things"". While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments. ""Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,"" the Eve Appeal says . It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful. The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and ""can ask the nurse to stop at any time"". Did you know about the adjustments available? People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include: A smaller speculum (the tube-shaped tool that's inserted into the vagina to help the nurse to take the sample) A longer appointment so you're not rushed More lubrication Moving to a different position Inserting or guiding the speculum yourself Bringing a friend for support But very few people are aware they can request these accommodations, according to recent research by the Eve Appeal. Less than a quarter of people surveyed said they knew they could request a smaller speculum and only 12% said they knew they could ask for a double appointment. Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations. Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online. But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot. What is it like to have the test as a transgender man? Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was ""incredibly supportive"" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening. Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings . Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot. Katie Reynolds Jack says his GP was ""incredibly supportive"" ""It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,"" Jack says. ""It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be."" Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix. How could the process be improved? The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years. NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%. The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years. Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings ""very worrying and uncomfortable"". She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago. A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper. Ella Clancy @designermakerella Artist Ella Clancy's exhibition at the Vagina Museum asked visitors to write down changes they'd like made to the cervical screening process Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware. Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for. Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter. Would you rather do the test yourself? Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with ""fantastic"" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab. The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely. Eleanor says she felt ""reassured"" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available. Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for ""the convenience and flexibility"" but that he'd ""have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly"".

05eb4f8a2bdc,Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?,,"Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines? Fergus Walsh Medical editor BBC There is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects. The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6.3m globally compared to 5.9m for Pfizer/BioNTech’s jab. However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect. This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage. They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored. Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire. Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side. Handout Jane pictured at a Parkrun, before she was affected by blood clots - and with her husband Ian more recently Two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Jane’s medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine. Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me: “Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now I’ve lost every bit of independence.” Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines. Social contract Almost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second. It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021. The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue. However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state. That’s where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) comes in. The VDPS was established in 1979 in the wake of a scare over the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in use at the time. The government-backed scheme offers a one-off financial payment of £120,000 in the event that, on the balance of probability, a vaccine has caused at least 60% disablement. Between the late 1970s and 2020 there were just below 6,500 claims under the scheme for all vaccines and 944 awards. Covid vaccine: Fighting for a payout The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving millions of lives but it was also responsible, in rare cases, for serious side-effects - blood clots in the brain - which could be fatal. This is the story of those fighting for compensation. Watch on iPlayer But something dramatic has happened since the pandemic. There have been more than double the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all other vaccines combined. Since the pandemic there have been almost 16,000 claims against Covid vaccines and 180 awards. Just over half of all claimants have yet to find out if they have been successful. So what is happening? Of the awards, all but a handful are for damage done by the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is no longer used. There is a long list of different health conditions that qualify for a payment but the AstraZeneca jab had one specific rare side effect not seen in the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna, which are now the mainstay of all Covid booster campaigns. The side effect is a type of blood clot, often in the brain, combined with low platelet levels, almost always within a few weeks after receiving the first dose. This can cause damage in the brain and to multiple other organs. Platelets are cells that help your blood clot, and it was so unusual to see blood clots combined with low platelet levels, that experts coined a new medical term: vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia , or VITT. These were so unusual that the signal was not seen in the clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 23,000 participants, but only once the jab had started being rolled out across Europe and given to millions. In mid-March 2021, a dozen European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab while the clots link was investigated. Then, in April that year, the UK restricted the vaccine to the over-30s, and a month later to the over-40s because it became clear that younger people were at higher risk from the clots. Several other European countries, when they resumed using the AstraZeneca vaccine, set the age limit much higher : France to those aged over 55; Germany, Italy and the Irish Republic to the over-60s. Denmark halted its use altogether. In early April 2021, safety regulators in the UK and Europe had concluded that blood clots combined with low platelets should be listed as a rare side effect. The rare syndrome was also reported among recipients of the J&J Janssen Covid jab, which uses the same type of vaccine technology , in the United States. 'Too little, too late, to too few' Sarah Moore, a solicitor with the law firm Leigh Day, says the families she represents have been driven to sue AstraZeneca because of the inadequacies of the VDPS. “The scheme offers too little, too late, to too few people,” she says. She describes the £120,000 payment as “woefully inadequate”, pointing out that the figure had not increased since 2007. Had the sum kept pace with inflation , it would now stand at £197,000. Ms Moore says some of her clients need 24-hour care, cannot wash or dress themselves, have been left with severe physical or cognitive deficits and will never work again. The case of Jane and Ian Wrigley also illustrates another criticism of the VDPS: delay. The couple waited over two years for a payment under the scheme, despite the clear-cut nature of the case. Assessments under the VDPS are done on paper and do not involve physical examination. Last year, the government announced that it had modernised the operations of the VDPS to allow cases to be processed more quickly and increased the number of staff dealing with claims from four to 80. But a huge backlog of claims has built up. Peter Schulze, 49, is another member of the group action against AstraZeneca. He too suffered VITT blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in April 2021 and now needs 24-hour care. His submission to the VDPS was completed in July 2022, yet he is still awaiting a decision, despite VITT blood clots being clearly mentioned in his medical records. Peter Schulze was left unable to stand or walk, lost the sight in one eye and now has difficulty reading Finally there is the 60% disablement threshold for successful claims, which has ruled out hundreds of people who are officially recognised as having been damaged by Covid vaccines. Ms Moore says she had a female client who was now blind in one eye, with other physical and psychological injuries, but was told she didn’t reach the 60% threshold. She says under normal civil claim rules, blindness in one eye could lead to compensation of more than £200,000. It was “absolutely heartbreaking”, she added, for people to be told that the vaccine has caused their injuries yet be informed they are not disabled enough to qualify for a payment. Who pays? During the pandemic, the government granted vaccine manufacturers legal indemnity .  This did not prevent people from making a claim for compensation against pharmaceutical firms, but determined who would pay in the event of a successful action. Then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons: “We are providing indemnities in the very unexpected event of any adverse reactions that could not have been foreseen through the robust checks and procedures that have been put in place.” Ms Moore says she has not seen a copy of this legal undertaking but believes it means that the government will pick up AstraZeneca’s legal costs and would be responsible for paying compensation in the event of a successful claim. AstraZeneca made no profit from its Covid vaccine, Vaxrevia, but its total revenue in 2023 was $45.8bn (£35.1bn) with profits of $5.9bn. In May AstraZeneca withdrew Vaxrevia citing a “surplus of available updated vaccines”. The UK government did not buy any doses for its booster programmes and all Covid vaccines used in the UK for this autumn’s booster campaign are either Pfizer or Moderna, both of which use mRNA technology. Prof Adam Finn is one of the UK’s leading experts on vaccines, and throughout the pandemic was a member of the JCVI, the body which advises the government on immunisation. He was involved in key decisions on recommending the order in which the public received Covid vaccines and the age restrictions put on the AstraZeneca jab when the clots risks emerged. Prof Finn, who is professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, says Covid vaccines were a massive success and “really saved a lot of people's lives”. He is not involved in the legal action and believes the decisions taken in the UK around the vaccines’ use were correct. But he says the VDPS is “clearly not working as it should” and that payments should be index-linked so that they reflect changes in the cost of living. He also criticises the “very arbitrary” 60% threshold for payouts. Prof Finn adds that it’s necessary “to take a really good look” at compensation for all current and future vaccines. I point out to Prof Finn that there was a danger in a report like this that it could undermine confidence in vaccines. He rejects this: “The only way to retain trust is to be honest.” But he does think the inadequacies of the VDPS risk undermining that public confidence in vaccines. While only a small proportion of people have been affected, he says, “they've been very seriously harmed and that is going to attract public attention. It's going to be reported, and people are going to reflect on that, and people will want to see those people treated fairly”. In a statement, AstraZeneca said:  “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation. Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority."" The statement added that AstraZeneca’s vaccine “has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects”. The health secretary Wes Streeting recently met with people who have been injured or bereaved as a result of vaccine damage. In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the meeting was to “listen to their concerns” and said “the government will look closely at these as we continue to learn and apply the lessons of the pandemic”. The statement added: “Our deepest sympathies are with those who have suffered harm.” The DHSC said the administrator of the VDPS had made operational changes to the scheme in an effort to reduce the time claimants wait for an outcome. The workings of the VDPS will be considered in the next module of the Covid inquiry, which will begin taking evidence in January 2025. Ms Moore, who expects to give evidence to the inquiry, says her clients are not “anti-vax”. She says: “We are acting for people who stood up and got vaccinated. By definition they’re all pro-vaccination. This is an act to support vaccine confidence.” As for the legal action against AstraZeneca, that could drag on for years.

While the Scots weren't shooting the lights out in attack, they also allowed Belarus to be comfortable for large parts of the game. The fact they had 10 shots more than Scotland is a huge cause for concern. ""At half-time the manager came in but he was absolutely furious with us,"" said defender Scott McKenna. ""We didn't win any first balls, didn't win any second balls either. Belarus probably looked more dangerous than us over the 90 minutes."" Despite the fury, self-reflection and pain, Scotland are still in a strong position. An away game in Athens against a Greece team who can no longer catch them, and then a Hampden showdown against Denmark next month lies in wait. Everyone from the Scotland camp who spoke acknowledged what they've produced over the past week will not get the job done, but there is a belief that they have it in them to find solutions. Somehow.

On a featherbed pitch in Visakhapatnam, India posted a commanding 330 from 48.5 overs - the highest total Australia had ever conceded in an ODI. The platform for India was laid by a 155-run opening stand between Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal, who accelerated quickly once they got themselves in. Mandhana was the chief aggressor, top-scoring with 80 off 66 balls, while a string of cameos from India's middle order continued the assault. All-rounder Annabel Sutherland swung some of the momentum back Australia's way in the second half of India's innings as she finished with impressive figures of 5-40. Lesser teams might have been daunted by the chase, but Australia captain Healy produced a stoic knock to put her side on course for victory. Healy's innings off 107 balls featured 21 fours and three sixes and was chanceless until she sliced Shree Charani, who claimed 3-41, to Sneh Rana, grapsing a diving catch with her fingernails at point. With 66 required off 67 deliveries, Ash Gardner, who made 45, steered Australia close before Kim Garth and Ellyse Perry got the World Cup holders within striking distance. Perry had retired earlier in her innings with cramp but came back to finish the job and whacked a six off Rana to get Australia over the line with six balls to spare.

After the September meeting, Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland as ""not brilliant to watch"" and they ""played a lot of long balls"".

Last week, O'Neill said that it was not his job to set up the team to the benefit of opposing managers. On Sunday, Nagelsmann said his characterisation of Northern Ireland's style was intended ""with a lot of respect"". ""I said it may not be beautiful to watch but the more important topic, the key topic I mentioned, is they do it really well. They play long balls with an idea,"" he added. ""They have a special mood in the team and I also mentioned it's very difficult to beat this team, they don't concede many goals and create a lot of chances also by set-pieces by doing this way. ""If anybody felt it was disrespectful, I will say sorry. I did not mean it as disrespectful, it was with a lot of respect for the team and they way they play.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c803eelrpn7o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e879/live/0ab56e70-a79a-11f0-8c9e-87f67f3eb58c.jpg,2025-10-12T19:26:23.158000+00:00,b10f18f486d2f8eed1151bf5f6bd04a7f49402ce
758d17850b6c,How grit and goals define new Man City approach,,"City leading the WSL scoring charts with 17 goals after six games comes as no surprise, but what does is the timing of their goals. Aoba Fujino's 86th minute winner at Anfield on Sunday was their sixth in the 80th minute or later this season - 35% of their WSL goals under Jeglertz. ""It says a lot about our side. There's something special with this group. No matter if we're one goal down. You see a team saying: OK we need to do something about this,"" Jeglertz told Sky Sports. City have now won six points from losing positions in the WSL this season, more than any other side. The top scorers have scored in all six of their outings, something no other side has managed. City have had nine different scorers this season - more than any other side - easing the burden on Khadija Shaw, and potentially lessening the drop-off that was suffered whenever she was absent last season. ""The style of play we used to play was very much the same way Pep [Guardiola] wants to play with the men's,"" full-back Kerstin Casparij told Sky Sports recently. ""We've let go a little bit of that at times and have been a bit more free and direct, especially up top. ""For me that translates into having a lot more freedom, progressing on the pitch and being trusted in my instincts."" What's particularly impressive about City's goalscoring exploits and their ability to stay in matches until the end is that they are doing so without several key players. Lauren Hemp has missed City's past three league games with an ankle injury, as has Kerolin, whose speed and directness is key to Jeglertz's system. Add long-term absentees Lily Murphy and Mary Fowler to the list, and City are without two starting XIs worth of wingers. Mentality in football is an intangible thing, but after already coming from behind to beat Brighton and scoring late winners against Arsenal and Liverpool, City's squad does appear to have added fortitude to its undeniably stacked arsenal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2dnddy6dy9o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/7de1/live/6abb16d0-a79f-11f0-8e16-57fbf5e657fe.jpg,2025-10-12T19:56:26.267000+00:00,ba93c429b69b265509bb5d75143e4f6e66fe6753

3633932c3402,England's Penge wins Spanish Open in play-off,,"Marco Penge held his nerve in a play-off to defeat fellow Englishman Daniel Brown and take the Spanish Open title in Madrid. Penge held a four-shot lead over nearest challenger Joel Girrbach going into the final round, while he was five shots better off than Brown. However, he only had a one-shot advantage going to the 18th on Sunday after his lead was trimmed. After Penge made par to finish with a one-over 72 for his final round at the Club de Campo, Brown sank a birdie putt for a 67 which forced a play-off as both finished on 15 under. At the first time of asking in the sudden-death play-off, Penge birdied the 18th with an eight-foot putt to secure a third European Tour title of the season. Penge's victory in Spain also means he has automatically qualified for the 154th Open at Royal Birkdale next year as well at the Masters at Augusta. ""It was a strange day for me,"" said Penge, who carded 66, 67 and 64 in his first three rounds. ""I had it in my head that the golfing gods were kind of against me in a way. Dan and Joel played great, they were holing putts and putting the pressure on me. ""I just couldn't get it in the hole. It felt like I was really up against it, but I felt like I managed myself really well."" Penge was given a three-month ban in December 2024 for placing bets on multiple events, with one month suspended for a year. He has resumed his career in fine fashion and said: ""I think tee to green I played solid and it was just a matter of the putts - I think I used them all yesterday, but holing that one [on the play-off hole] was worth the wait.""

a7122f5aab39,Wales sense 'special moment' before Belgium showdown,,"Wales' World Cup qualifier at home to Belgium on Monday already had the feel of a big game. Now, it has the makings of a defining night. That is because Wales' fate is back in their own hands, thanks to Belgium's goalless draw at home to North Macedonia on Friday. If Craig Bellamy's side win their three remaining games, they will qualify for next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. That, though, is quite a big if. The most imposing hurdle to clear is arguably their next one. This might not be the Belgium that finished third at the 2018 World Cup or the team that topped the world rankings just three years ago, but they are still formidable opponents with the likes of Kevin de Bruyne and Jeremy Doku among their phalanx of attacking talent. Not that Wales are intimidated, not with a head coach as single-minded â and optimistic â as Bellamy. ""I believe there's always a special moment coming,"" he said. ""Players have been in this situation so many times over the last 10 years, especially Cardiff nights. When we've managed to qualify, it's been here.

89bc27b25dd8,The numbers behind O'Neill's Northern Ireland century,,"After two stints across almost 14 years, Michael O'Neill will take charge of his 100th Northern Ireland match against Germany on Monday.

It's a landmark figure for one of the greatest managers in the country's history, and he has already acknowledged the focus is on a huge World Cup qualifier rather than his own personal landmark.

But what are the numbers behind his century?

With the help of Northern Ireland's stats man Marshall Gillespie, BBC Sport NI takes a look.

O'Neill has used 94 players in his 99 Northern Ireland games to date.

There are no surprise names among his most-used players, and all played a key role in the run to Euro 2016.

Steven Davis leads the way, and he is joined by Jonny Evans at the top of the list.

Paddy McNair is the only active player in the top five, and he continues to build up the caps by playing a key role in the young current squad.

Ollie Norwood is another notable name in the list despite stepping away from Northern Ireland duty in 2018.

After he was appointed in December 2011, O'Neill first took charge of Northern Ireland in February 2012 in a 3-0 friendly defeat at home to Norway.

His starting team from that night had a number of familiar names, many of whom would help Northern Ireland qualify for Euro 2016 such as Davis, Jonny and Corry Evans, Aaron Hughes, Gareth McAuley and Shane Ferguson.

He would have to wait until August 2013 for his first win as manager as Martin Paterson's goal gave NI a 1-0 win over Fabio Capello's Russia at Windsor Park.

Here's how O'Neill's starting teams have evolved through his first match against Norway, the Euro 2016 opener with Poland, his first game back in San Marino in March 2023 and then Friday's win over Slovakia.

Of the 94 players used by O'Neill, 63 were born in Northern Ireland, while 31 qualified through eligibility.

He has handed debuts to 49 players, the last of which was Jamie McDonnell, who won his first cap off the bench in Germany in September.

Across the two spells, 14 players have been handed the captain's armband by O'Neill.

Davis' importance to Northern Ireland is evident in the 61 times he wore the armband, and Jonny Evans is the only other player to break double figures.

Since the pair retired, O'Neill has rotated the captaincy around a number of his young squad, and this can be seen that Trai Hume is next on the list with six, while Shea Charles and Conor Bradley both have led Northern Ireland three times each.

Including five opposition players, 37 men have scored the 110 goals across O'Neill's two tenures between them.

Kyle Lafferty leads the way with 12, seven of which came in qualifying for Euro 2016.

Isaac Price has burst on to the international scene and is hot on Lafferty's heels, and it feels like a matter of when, not if, he moves to the top of the list.

Hume is the latest player to add their name to the list after his superb goal against Slovakia on Friday.

In terms of percentage scored, it is fairly even across each half as 56 of the 110 goals have come in the opening 45 minutes, while 54 have arrived after the restart.

Here are the various goal milestones under Michel O'Neill:

First - Shane Ferguson v Finland (H) â August 2012

25th - Kyle Lafferty v Hungary (H) â September 2015

50th â Josh Magennis v San Marino (A) â September 2017

75th â Michael Smith v Germany (A) â November 2019

100th â Conor Bradley v Luxembourg (A) â November 2024

Assists for the 110 goals under O'Neill have been shared around 36 players, with three players tied on seven assists each.

It's no surprise to see Davis up at the top once again, while Norwood's importance from set-pieces means he is joint top.

Of course, Norwood also supplied one of the most memorable assists in Northern Ireland history when he set up Gareth McAuley to score against Ukraine at Euro 2016.

George Saville has been a regular in squads since making his debut in 2017 and, while he is yet to score a goal, has popped up with six assists.

O'Neill will join Billy Bingham in reaching a century of games in charge of Northern Ireland.

Along with Peter Doherty at the 1958 World Cup, they are the only bosses to lead Northern Ireland to a major tournament.

We've already touched on O'Neill's stats as manager, but how do they compare to Bingham?

They are actually very similar, and O'Neill only needs three more victories to have the most in NI history.

Two different eras. Two greats.

The starting XI which played in Luxembourg in the Nations League in November 2024 had an average age of just 22.2.

Not only is it the youngest starting team under O'Neill, but it was also the youngest Northern Ireland XI since the end of World War Two.

O'Neill's young side would draw 2-2 in Luxembourg after they let a two-goal lead slip.

There's a lot of focus on youth currently with O'Neill's Northern Ireland squad, but lets not forget some of the legends of his first tenure.

Gareth McAuley was the oldest player to have played under O'Neill when he won his final cap for Northern Ireland against Austria in November 2018 aged 38 years and 348 days - just a few days shy of his 39th birthday.

Aaron Hughes, another key defender for O'Neill, was 38 years and 207 days old when he made his last appearance in June 2018.

Midfielder Davis was 37 years and 269 days old when he played his final NI game in September 2022, but was robbed of a reunion with O'Neill - who returned to the role that December - due to the knee injury that would eventually force him to retire.

Two very different results from O'Neill's two stints in charge.

The biggest defeat came early in his reign and it was the first time Northern Ireland had conceded six goals in 51 years.

Robin van Persie scored twice in Amsterdam, as did Ibrahim Afellay, while Wesley Sneijder and Ron Vlaar were also on target.

In contrast, O'Neill's young team produced a five-goal performance at home to Bulgaria in October 2024.

Price scored a hat-trick, while an Dimitar Mitov own goal and Josh Magennis effort secured a famous win in Belfast.

Northern Ireland have faced 46 different countries during O'Neill's time in charge.

Luxembourg and Germany are currently tied for the most-faced opponents, and it is fitting he will bring up his 100th game when he takes on the Germans for a seventh time.

Luxembourg have also been familiar opponents, and they will also face Northern Ireland in the final World Cup qualifier in November.

Seven players have been sent off in O'Neill's 99 games as Northern Ireland manager.

What immediately jumps out is how much discipline has improved since the start of his first tenure.

Chris Brunt and Kyle Lafferty were both sent off against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in September 2013, and Jonny Evans followed suit the following month in Azerbaijan.

Defender McAuley's dismissal in Cyprus made it four red cards in three international windows, while Chris Baird was controversially sent off for two fouls in the same phase of play the following year.

Charles' dismissal was the first after O'Neill's return, while Brodie Spencer was shown a rare red card in a friendly in June.

Nine players have won just one cap under O'Neill for Northern Ireland.

In his first stint in charge, James McPake and Michael O'Connor won their sole international caps under O'Neill in 2012.

A 6-0 defeat in the Netherlands was McPake's only Northern Ireland appearance, while O'Connor's 13th cap came after a four-year break away from the international set-up against Luxembourg in 2013.

Paddy Lane and Alfie McCalmont have a handful of Northern Ireland caps each, but all but one came under Ian Baraclough, while Cameron McGeehan 's sole NI cap came against San Marino in 2023.

More recently, Ronan Hale and Aaron Donnelly, Jamie McDonnell and Michael Forbes have won their sole international caps under O'Neill, although it would not be a huge surprise to see them add to their respective tallies in the future.

Not the most ground-breaking stat you will read in this article, but it provided memories to last a lifetime for everyone involved.

67ed44b61f86,Mpome 'up and about' after being knocked out at Arsenal,,"Brighton defender Maelys Mpome is ""up and about"" after being knocked out during their Women's Super League defeat at Arsenal on Sunday.

There was a 10-minute break in play after Mpome was struck in the face by a ball during the second half at Emirates Stadium.

Several medics attended to the French defender, who had to be taken from the field on a stretcher, with her head in a brace and receiving oxygen. It was later confirmed she had also suffered a concussion.

But Brighton manager Dario Vidosic said Mpome was with her team-mates in the changing room after the game.

""I just asked for a quick update,"" Vidosic told BBC Sport. ""They said she is up and about, and she is having a shower which is positive news.

""Fingers crossed that she is OK. That's always the most important thing - that the players all come off the field as healthy as they stepped on it.""

Vidosic said that concern from Mpome's team-mates may have had an impact on their performance as Brighton chased an equaliser.

Brighton trailed after Marisa Olislager's own goal in the first half but improved and forced several saves from Arsenal keeper Daphne van Domselaar.

But they failed to create many openings after Mpome's injury, with the home side coming closer to scoring in the final moments.

""It's never nice to see your team-mate get hurt,"" Vidosic said. ""Maybe that did play a part, fatigue as well.

""We tried to push everyone as much as we could in a safe way, but maybe it took the rhythm out of the game with the 10-minute pause.""

Mpome joined Brighton from WSL champions Chelsea in the summer and was making her fifth league appearance for the Seagulls.

b64e900e614b,Park's explosive start at Man Utd as move pays off,,"It was a surprise to see Park not in the starting XI as United plotted to spoil Everton's first WSL match at the new Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it was all part of a strategy designed to unsettle the hosts. Since her move in the summer, Park has become a key figure for manager Marc Skinner, playing alongside Ella Toone in an attacking midfield set-up that is flourishing. ""I genuinely believe her and Tooney become alive and are electric together. We just have to be able to adapt and evolve it,"" said Skinner. It has come as a welcome surprise that United have been able to get the best out of Toone and Park - something that wasn't always as easy with Clinton and Toone. It is also a partnership that could benefit England, and former Lionesses striker Ellen White said Park looks more ""free"" in the role she has at United, compared to how she was used at City. ""This has been a really great move for Jess Park. There was a lot of questions but she has let her football do the talking,"" White said on the Women's Football Weekly podcast. ""She has settled in really well. She is great on the ball technically and also has good fitness levels so she will defend."" Skinner said the two were training together on Saturday, taking up shooting positions specific to a number 10 - and it paid off with Park's double at Everton. ""In training, we've been working on Jess opening up her body and where she might receive the ball and different ways to finish,"" Skinner said. ""They both [scored lots in training]. In the number 10 role you usually have one touch to set the ball, then a second to hit it. ""It was working on that speed and both were excellent."" Skinner knew Everton would be well prepared for Park given manager Brian Sorensen worked with her during a 2022-23 loan spell with the Toffees. The United boss hoped to catch his Everton dugout rival off guard and was able to use Park effectively off the bench. ""We rotated to play a winger system rather than the number 10 system. They had to adapt,"" said Skinner. ""It was nice to give her a rest, but when she came on I knew she would unlock those pockets. I just think there is loads more goals in her.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy7p7zxx22zo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/331c/live/34cf19e0-a777-11f0-91a2-f3f3bd434eb5.jpg,2025-10-12T17:21:26.990000+00:00,98423761a4663b6825de85d7b8420a0c9733486d

7fa8b6c40ed9,Who would you pick? Wane faces big England calls,,"The three-quarter line offers so many options, despite the loss of Matty Ashton to a season-ending injury. Out wide, Hull's speedy Lewis Martin - a former Hull City youth footballer - was Super League's top scorer, but is this too early for him? Dom Young, who left Sydney Roosters for Newcastle mid-season, has been a rampaging force out wide for England, athletic and powerful. Joe Burgess has three England caps but has not been in the reckoning of late, despite scoring regularly for Salford and now Hull KR. His team-mate Tom Davies is another who does great work out of back-field as well as out wide - but he only has one cap. Liam Marshall scored on his England debut against Samoa last November, after several prolific seasons with Wigan, and will surely be considered. Herbie Farnworth, arguably one of the best players in the world, has sewn up one of the centre spots, so who goes in alongside? Jake Wardle has had another impressive season at Wigan, while Harry Newman - who Wane has shown faith in during recent series - was again a regular for Leeds. Roosters' Billy Smith and Gold Coast utility AJ Brimson, two Australia-born players, might come into consideration but will have to impose their desire and passion on Wane if they are to get the nod.

fc59f11df28f,Smith inspires Harlequins to victory over Saracens,,"Smith, making his first club appearance of the season after touring Australia with the British and Irish Lions in the summer, needed less than nine minutes to make an impact. After Saracens failed to cleanly gather Smith's high kick into their defensive 22, Quins eventually worked the ball to their talismanic number 10, who burst through two tackles to touch down in the corner. Quins pressed to extend their advantage, but it was Saracens who scored next with a sensational team move started by Farrell's excellent short pass to Lucio Cinti, who broke clear and set up fly-half Burke to stroll over unopposed. Smith, denied a second try following intervention by the TMO because of a scrum infraction, kicked Quins three points ahead after Saracens were penalised at the reset scrum. Almost immediately after the restart, home full-back Green contested another high Smith kick, booted the loose ball ahead, and won the foot race to ground the ball near the posts to make it 17-7 after Smith's conversion. A spell of Saracens attacking pressure ended with Farrell's kick across field picking out the unmarked England and Lions back row Earl to touch down, again bringing the gap between the sides to three points with Farrell kicking the extras. But a comeback from the visitors failed to materialise in the final 15 minutes, and after Quins debutant Boris Wenger had a try ruled out by the TMO for a double movement, Smith sealed victory by knocking over another penalty with the clock past 80 minutes. Before kick-off, there was a minute's applause in memory of former Harlequins academy coach Warren Abrahams, who has died aged 43 .

1d64a2877934,Former Wales women head coach Abrahams dies aged 43,,"Former Wales women's head coach Warren Abrahams has died, aged 43.

Belgium Rugby announced that the South Africa-born coach died while with the national women's team at the Safari 7s tournament in Kenya.

The Belgium rugby federation said it was shocked and saddened by the sudden loss.

""Warren was so much more than a coach, he was a mentor, a leader and above all, a kind and generous human being,"" the federation added.

""His smile, wisdom and calm strength he brought ton the team will never be forgotten.""

Abrahams coached Harlequins' academy between 2011 and 2019 and went on to work on the sevens management teams with USA women and England men.

He was appointed head coach of Wales women in November 2020 but left the following summer after less than nine months in the role.

The Welsh Rugby Union said: ""Our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Warren Abrahams from everyone in Welsh rugby.""

Abrahams worked as a consultant with Brazil's women's sevens team before joining Belgium earlier this year.

Harlequins said: ""His passion, leadership and commitment to developing players were felt not only at Harlequins, but throughout the wider rugby world during his distinguished career.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c4gqgk12e47o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d0fb/live/419a90b0-a77b-11f0-9f5f-19b03c1693c8.jpg,2025-10-12T14:12:32.064000+00:00,397169354a66bdbefd718cbacbc3d13b8fccfdd8
a38acc2e007c,Broncos survive scare to beat Jets in London,,"The Jets' defence looked set to struggle against Denver's run game. Broncos running back JK Dobbins came in fifth in the league for rushing yards (402) while the Jets had conceded an average of 31.4 points (second most) and 140 rushing yards per game (sixth most). The Jets also became the first team not to claim a single takeaway in their first five games of the season, since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933. But it was the Jets' defence and special teams unit that stepped up at Tottenham, accounting for eight of their 11 points. They ended their turnover drought with a fumble recovery on the game's very first drive before making a 72-yard kick-off return, which set up two field goals. The Jets then forced Denver to punt on five of their next six possessions and earned a safety on the other, before the Broncos could finally do some damage on the ground to earn what proved to be the game-winning field goal. It is testimony to the Jets' defence that they almost won despite earning just 82 yards on offence and -10 passing yards, as they lost 55 yards as a result of the nine sacks. It was their offensive line that was found wanting on this occasion. New head coach Glenn is getting close to his first win. Four of the Jets' six defeats have been one-score games. But he needs some semblance of an all-round team performance if they are to finally get over the hump. Glenn said that, in certain moments, Fields should have released the ball sooner. ""This is probably our best game on defence, but our passing game was non-existent,"" Glenn said. ""When you have a team that pressures that much and plays that much man coverage, sometimes you've just got to give your guys a chance to win a one-on-one. ""It's tough being close.

Steven Davis, Borna Barisic, Jermaine Defoe, Ianis Hagi, Calvin Bassey, Joe Aribo and Kemar Roofe improved things. There were also duds - far too many - but Gerrard was bullet proof. The wage bill kept on rocketing throughout his time. The operating losses soared to fund the vision - in his three full seasons, including the financially wounding Covid era, Rangers recorded operating losses of more than Â£50m. Celtic's losses across the span covering the pandemic were about Â£100,000. That latitude does not exist anymore. There are more lines of command at the club. There is a squad that maybe Gerrard didn't fancy and would have wanted to change, but that freedom he had before would not be there now. Thelwell, the sporting director appointed by the owners, signed all of these guys. You could say that Saturday and last summer were the two times Gerrard custard-pied Rangers, but of course there was a third. On a Thursday in October 2021, Gerrard was interviewed after his Rangers team - reigning champions of Scotland - had beaten Brondby 2-0 in the Europe League. That week there'd been speculation linking him with Newcastle, so the rumours were put to him. ""Do I look happy?"" he asked, in a rhetorical sense. ""Do I look settled? Don't ask me silly questions then."" Five games later he was no longer Rangers manager. He went to Aston Villa and won eight games out of 31 and was sacked with Villa 17th in the Premier League. Later, he went to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, got them to sixth in his first season and left by mutual consent after 18 months when his team fell to 12th, just five points above the relegation zone. Gerrard was the manager Rangers wanted, but he's been beaten up since he left Ibrox. There was no guarantee that they'd have been getting the hot property of 2021, the great redeemer who, eventually, stopped Celtic in their tracks. Who they will get is now anybody's guess.

Vacherot then continued the winner's tradition of writing a message on one of the courtside cameras, writing ""Grandpa and Grandma would be proud"". Both players struggled to hold back tears during their post-match speeches on court, while Rinderknech tumbled off the back of the stage as his cousin spoke.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Viktor Gyokeres (left), Alexander Isak (centre) and Benjamin Sesko all made high-profile transfers in the summer, joining Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United respectively By Michael Emons BBC Sport journalist Strikers dominated the summer transfer window as a host of major Premier League sides looked to strengthen up front. Not a day went by without speculation as reigning champions Liverpool and last season's runners-up Arsenal were among the teams to bolster their attacking options, with Manchester United and Chelsea doing likewise. We had strikers going on strike, clubs gazumping their rivals and plenty more drama along the way. With the international break ongoing, clubs are left to reflect on their seven league matches so far. But how have the big-name forward signings got on? We have taken a look at nine of them to see how they have fared - and want you to have your say. Thierno Barry (Everton) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Among those to have played at least 180 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player averages more off-ball runs in behind per 90 minutes than Barry's 17.7 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 208. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1. Everton paid Â£27m to sign 22-year-old striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal after he scored 11 La Liga goals last season. But it has been a tough start at the Toffees for the France Under-21 international. He is yet to score in nine games in all competitions and five of his seven Premier League appearances have come as a substitute, with Beto often preferred by manager David Moyes. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (17) and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta (14) have recorded more flick-ons in the Premier League this season than Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 13 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 5. Minutes played: 357. Goals: 1. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 7. Chances created: 6. After scoring 57 Premier League goals for Everton in a nine-year spell, Dominic Calvert-Lewin left the Toffees on a free transfer and quickly joined newly promoted Leeds United. England international Calvert-Lewin, 28, had a chance to ""revive his career"", said Whites boss Daniel Farke, who has regularly used the striker - starting him in four of Leeds' Premier League matches so far. Calvert-Lewin got his first goal for the club, and his first since January, in Leeds' 3-1 win at Wolves on 20 September, but that remains his only goal of the campaign. Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Hugo Ekitike has a shot accuracy of 40% in the Premier League this season and no summer signing has scored more than him so far Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 386. Goals: 3. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 4. Chances created: 4. France international Ekitike was a wanted man in the summer, with Newcastle United the first club to make a bid for him. With Liverpool initially being frustrated in their efforts to sign Alexander Isak from the Magpies, the Reds quickly made a move themselves - signing him for an initial Â£69m from Eintracht Frankfurt. To Newcastle's frustration, Liverpool also went on to sign Isak. The 23-year-old has proved an instant hit with the fans, although question marks remain around how he and Isak will fit into the champions' team together. Ekitike has scored three goals and has one assist so far, but was sent off after taking his shirt off while celebrating a late winner against Southampton in the Carabao Cup. Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo (108) and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins (100) have made more off-ball runs in behind in the Premier League this season than Gyokeres' 86.

Chances created: 5. Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in 2024-25 and helped Sporting win a second successive Portuguese league title before moving to Arsenal in the summer. The Gunners signed the 27-year-old in a deal that could be worth up to Â£64m, and he has been a vital part of the side that sits on top of the Premier League table. He has started all seven of their league games, scoring twice in the 5-0 win over Leeds and once in the 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, and has also started in both of Arsenal's Champions League victories. Alexander Isak (Liverpool) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Arsenal's Leandro Trossard (0.62) has a higher xG (expected goals) among players without a shot on target in the Premier League this season than Alexander Isak's 0.61 Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 3. Minutes played: 181. Goals: 0. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1. Alexander Isak's protracted transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool was the story of the summer window. The Sweden striker released a statement in which he said promises had been ""broken"" by Newcastle and that their ""relationship can't continue"" after Liverpool's first bid was rejected, before he finally moved on transfer deadline day for a British record of Â£125m. But, without much of a pre-season, Isak, 26, has made a slow start at Liverpool. He is yet to have a shot on target after his first three Premier League games, although he has registered an assist and scored in a 2-1 win over Southampton in the Carabao Cup. Igor Jesus (Nottingham Forest) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Among strikers with 10 or more aerial duels in the Premier League this season, only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84.2% - 16/19) has a higher success rate than Igor Jesus' 60% (6/10) Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 101. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 2. Chances created: 1. Brazil international striker Igor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest in a Â£10m move from Botafogo in July. It has been a tough start to the campaign for Forest, who are without a win in nine games in all competitions and sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, replacing him with Ange Postecoglou in September. Jesus, 24, is yet to score in the Premier League but has scored four goals in cup competitions - two in the 3-2 Carabao Cup loss to Swansea City and then another double a week later, when Forest drew 2-2 with Real Betis in the Europa League. Joao Pedro (Chelsea) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (10) and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (nine) have more goal involvements in the Premier League this season than Joao Pedro's five (two goals, three assists) Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 586. Goals: 2. Assists: 3. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 7. Chelsea completed a deal worth Â£60m to take Brazil forward Joao Pedro from Brighton on an eight-year contract, and he headed straight to the United States to play at the Club World Cup. His two goals in the semi-final helped beat Fluminense and he then scored against European champions Paris St-Germain as Chelsea won the final. In the Premier League he has scored twice and assisted three goals, although he has not scored in his past six games in all competitions. However, with Cole Palmer and another new Blues striker Liam Delap, a Â£30m summer signing from Ipswich Town, both injured, Joao Pedro, 24, is leading the Chelsea line every week. Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, No player has scored more goals from inside the six-yard box in the Premier League this season than Benjamin Sesko's two Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 385. Goals: 2. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 6. Chances created: 5. Manchester United completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth Â£73.7m in August. The 22-year-old Slovenia international's first start came as United suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, who won 12-11 on penalties, with Sesko criticised as he was the last of 10 United outfielders to take a spot-kick in the shootout. However, he has scored twice in recent weeks, in the 3-1 loss against Brentford on 27 September and then again seven days later in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland. Nick Woltemade (Newcastle United) Image source, Getty Images Image caption, No player has more headed goals in the Premier League this season than his two, which is as many as he scored in his 70 appearances in the Bundesliga Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 4. Minutes played: 305. Goals: 3. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 2. With Alexander Isak making it clear he wanted to move from Newcastle to Liverpool, Eddie Howe moved to sign 23-year-old Germany striker Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in (1.98m) frontman joined in a club record deal worth up to Â£69m and has already made an impact.

3289e095829d,Glasner in Palace deal talks but needs 'right conditions',,"Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish says talks have taken place with Oliver Glasner about extending the contract of the Eagles manager as the two parties look to ""align their interests"". Glasner will be out of contract at the end of the season and there is uncertainty about the 51-year-old's future at the club. Sources have told BBC Sport the Austrian was offered a new deal earlier this summer, but he has yet to sign the contract. ""We've had some early conversations,"" Parish told Talksport. ""We would love to keep Oliver, we're building something. I think for Oliver it's about the conditions being right."" Glasner took over as Palace boss in February 2024 and guided them to victory in last season's FA Cup - the club's first major trophy. Their triumph meant they qualified for the Europa League, but were demoted to the Conference League for breaching multi-club ownership rules . American businessman John Textor owned a stake in the Eagles at the time and was the majority owner of French club Lyon, who had also qualified for the Europa League. Glasner also led Palace to victory against Liverpool in the Community Shield in August and has steered them to sixth in the Premier League following a promising start to the season - four points off top spot. ""It's about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve,"" added Parish. ""Oliver wants to win things, he makes no secret of that. That's what he's in football for. ""So if we can align those interests then hopefully we can make something happen.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7494p3ye3xo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/01bf/live/cd8ddf30-a773-11f0-93e3-054bcb63bc18.jpg,2025-10-12T14:35:29.615000+00:00,e2bb236a4d21a83ac4bfc99ed710afdb753e794c

967c7ab0a88e,Schauffele wins first title for 14 months,,"Xander Schauffele won his first title since last year's Open Championship at the Baycurrent Classic in Japan. American Schauffele carded a final-round 64, featuring eight birdies, to finish one shot clear of compatriot Max Greyserman on 19-under at Yokohama Country Club. It was Schauffele's first event since the United States' Ryder Cup defeat by Europe at Bethpage Black in New York. The 31-year-old struggled with a rib injury at the start of the year which disrupted the momentum generated by his 2024 Open victory at Royal Troon, which came only two months after his maiden major win at the PGA Championship. Schauffele said he ""definitely had doubts"" about whether he would win another title again. ""I think every player in any sport, at some point in time you feel like you're on top of the world and then you feel like, not that you've lost it, but you feel less confident,"" said the American, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo in 2021. ""It was a rough year but my team dragged me through it. They pick me up when I'm down. ""Hopefully I'm catching my stride. It was a big learning experience with the injury this year."" Schauffele added that it was ""special"" to win in Japan, where his mother grew up and his grandparents still live. Michael Thorbjornsen, who briefly tied for the lead after an eagle at the fourth hole, finished three strokes behind Schauffele in third on 16 under par. Schauffele's Ryder Cup team-mate Collin Morikawa finished tied for 14th on 10 under.

fdc29e19d1e7,,,"He was England's top scorer when they reached the final of the delayed Euro 2020 tournament with four goals in seven games, although the 2022 World Cup ended in disappointment as Kane missed a penalty in the 2-1 defeat by France in the quarter-final in Qatar. Kane, by his own standards, had a disappointing Euro 2024, looking so jaded there was a clamour for England's captain to be replaced by Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. He was substituted in every one of England's knockout matches, including after only 61 minutes of the final loss to Spain in Berlin - and yet still finished as the tournament's joint top scorer with three goals from seven games. Kane is England's highest goalscorer in major tournaments, with 15 goals from 29 games. This total puts him fifth, when ranking combined European Championship and World Cup goals, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Germany trio Miroslav Klose, Gerd Muller and Jurgen Klinsmann. So has his stellar contribution been underappreciated? Sutton says: ""Anybody who has played either with or against him, raves about him. ""If people do not give him the credit he deserves, it may be because he's been England's main man for so long. People are sometimes there to chop you down. ""England players get judged on major tournaments and if they don't win it the criticism comes, with the high-profile captain usually first in that firing line. ""You can have rivalries, tribalism and social media, and there will be people who put the boot in, but you won't get anyone who has played the game to a reasonable level having any doubts about him. And I think most fair-minded supporters recognise what a player Harry Kane is."" Sutton added: ""He has never been blessed with great pace but the way his brain works is fantastic. He's not just a phenomenal goalscorer. He has the ability to drop deep to influence games, showing wonderful awareness, weight of passing, vision."" Former England defender Matthew Upson, who played against Kane and watches him regularly as a BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, says: ""The phrase 'you don't know what you've got until it's gone' springs to mind with Harry. ""I also think what plays into that is Kane's profile. For the scale of what he does, I think he keeps his profile quite low. ""He is quite understated in the way he operates, being the figure he is in world football. ""Other players are hitting numbers that are not quite as good as his, but you see them making more of a song and dance about what they are doing than he does.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpd9g9znx57o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/12c5/live/18ed3470-a446-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T05:23:47.985000+00:00,93d0f9418e6229b0b73c94f56476e8a9f33567aa
ebaba84ec15d,Who do Rangers fans want after Gerrard news?,,"Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl is reportedly the new favourite, but there appears to be no consensus about who Rangers should turn to next. Heart of Midlothian's Derek McInnes, St Mirren's Stephen Robinson, Livingston's David Martindale, former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, Coventry City's Frank Lampard, former caretaker Barry Ferguson, St Johnstone's Simo Valakari, former Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Gary O'Neil, former Everton manager Sean Dyche, ex-Aberdeen boss Neil Warnock, Marco Rose, formerly of RB Leipzig, Bodo/Glimt's Kjetil Knutsen, Shanghai Port's Kevin Muscat... take your pick. Graeme: I'm worried what message Gerrard's decision will send to other potential interested potential candidates and fans. Is it about available funds not being there for strengthening the squad? I'd love to see Benitez come, but I suspect another second-rate manager is on the cards. Mark: Why not look nearer to home - Stephen Robinson or David Martindale? Both solid performance. Gerrard left, so he should not have had the chance to come back. Or, if you want top notch, Rafael Benitez is free. David: I am glad he turned it down. Never forgiven him for leaving like he did last time, nor will I ever. Danny Rohl is the man for me. Donald: Not to keen on Steven Gerrard coming back, plus Russell Martin has ruined the team as he brought in too many duds. Derek McInnes was my favourite, but it won't happen this time round. Kenny: I'm sure Gerrard will return as Rangers boss one day. It looks like financial restraints are too much for him at this time, which is fair enough. However, the Rangers directors need to get it right this time. We need someone with experience and a proven track record. Jeff: If Lampard, McInnes or Ferguson are not announced, it's going to be Groundhog Day, but it'll be the board as well as Stewart and Thelwell who will come under pressure this time. Douglas: Simo Valakari would me my top choice. He has and is proving his ability in Scotland at St Johnstone with an enjoyable brand of football. Rangers should give him the opportunity before another club from England or Europe steps in. Edward: Barry and Neil [McCann] and Billy [Dodds] and Allan [McGregor] should be back as soon as possible. They did well in difficult circumstances last season. Martin: Gary O'Neil is a good person. Tam: Derek McInnes or Barry Ferguson are the only two that know Rangers and Scottish football. Nigel: Deflated. I think he would given everyone an immediate lift. Any manager we appoint now from the current names suggested would involve a settling in period trying to win over sceptics, which is how Martin started. McInnes or Ferguson for me. Susi: They need to appoint someone who is not just in it for the money. They need to have a bit of passion about the club. Frank: Never wanted Gerrard back. Said he wants to return to management with a club expected to win trophies as he believes that suits him. That's why he left for Aston Villa, then the Arab League - really? Should never have been considered. Potter is available and, given a five-year deal and left to get on with it, would be successful. Guy: Good decision by Gerrard. The players are poor, don't like criticism and the fans toxic and no sort of leadership from the owners. I like Rangers, but if you are a progressive manager, you don't touch. The people who sort the club out in respect of managers are Dyche or Neil Warnock - they need strong leaders who won't take crap from over-rated players. Ruaridh: I'm astonished that nobody seems to be mentioning Stephen Robinson for the Rangers vacancy. He knows Scottish football inside out and has always produced good footballing teams (and encouraged young talent) without having huge amounts of money to spend. He's just 10 minutes down the road too! We don't need a high-profile manager. We just need a good manager and Stephen Robinson is exactly that. Peter: Surprised. Disappointed but certainly not gutted. For me, Derek McInnes was and remains the clear number one choice, so hopefully Rangers now push the boat out to get him. Possibly a blessing in disguise. John: I never understood the desperation to get Gerrard in. His profile was the only aspect, because I do think they need a big character/name. Rohl is a gamble. They need a Lampard or Southgate to come in. William: I'm in the minority. I'm glad as it took him three years to win a title. We need a Graeme Souness -type manager who won't let players just turn up to get their huge salaries. A hard, experienced pro. David: I have said all along that Barry Ferguson and his staff is a natural selection to be manager. He has the commitment, the passion the respect of players and fans and the ability to mould a successful team to challenge Celtic. Ally: What they should have done in the first place and try get Derek McInnes. If he doesn't want to leave Hearts, it's got to be Barry with his same team again. They will set us up properly and go back to what Rangers used to be and have a strong Scottish base who know the league and the pressure playing for Rangers will bring. Bill: If Ange Postecoglou is sacked at Nottingham Forest, Rangers would be mad not to take him on board. He has a fantastic proven record in Scotland and is a brilliant tactician and man-manager. Would the owners be brave enough? Boaby: Personally I would go for Marco Rose, although there is no guarantee he would be interested. The obvious alternative is Mr McInnes, who had Walter Smith's endorsement, which is more than good enough for me. John: I'm actually glad Gerrard turned down Rangers. He's not what Rangers need. It's understandable to want to go back to the guy that last won something for the club. But he didn't take the club forward. Steve Cooper can and would take Rangers forward. Yet he's never been considered or even linked to the position. Chris: So glad Gerrard is not coming back. Let him go somewhere else to try to get his mojo back. Only one trophy winner in the names being banded about. Appoint Kevin Muscat now please and don't consider the other mediocre ""did well from limited resources or staved off relegation"" candidates please. Euan: Don't believe the statement for a minute. If timing wasn't right, why commit to the talks in the first place. Senior exec team at Rangers are displaying a concerning lack of football knowledge, fishing in a small pool of the footballs' unemployed/recently sacked. Why not be bold and try and tempt Kjetil Knutsen from Bodo/Glimt or someone else who is actually currently doing a good job? Callum: Whilst it would have been good to see Stevie back, we need a manager with experience to turn the squad around. So long as it is not another Martin-esque appointment like Rohl. Ian: I think Rangers should seek out Billy Davies for their next manager. He has a good record as a manager and was a good player for Rangers and knows what it means to play for them.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyxy0yvn4po,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/daa8/live/001293e0-a75d-11f0-a302-6bcd0f505684.jpg,2025-10-12T11:20:06.499000+00:00,3552e6bc4abc2d8cc6fa708a3708ac41e7cb954a

Argentina captain Messi, 38, was called up for Friday's match against Venezuela at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, home of NFL side the Miami Dolphins, and Tuesday's game against Puerto Rico, which has been relocated from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale. With the MLS continuing during the international break it was not clear if Messi would play for Inter Miami on Saturday in their penultimate regular season match. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner trained with Argentina during the week but watched Friday's match - which Argentina won 1-0 - from the stands, with national boss Lionel Scaloni saying he wanted to see Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez play together. Miami boss Javier Mascherano said they asked for Messi to leave the national set-up to play in their home match and he started against Atlanta, curling in his opener in the 39th minute and adding his second in the 87th to take him to the top of the MLS scoring charts with 26 goals. He also assisted Jordi Alba's second-half strike, while Luis Suarez scored Miami's other goal. ""Yesterday, before the match, I talked to [Argentina manager Lionel] Scaloni, and he said no, that he was not going to use him, that he was going to sit him down. And I spoke to Leo to see if he could play,"" said Mascherano. ""It was his decision, and clearly he saw the opportunity that if he wasn't going to play against Venezuela yesterday, we could use him. Leo, of course, was ready to do it. ""He is a very special player, he's an icon, and even though he didn't train last week with us, we saw what he did today.

Matthews benefited from the late withdrawals of Charles-Barclay and American Taylor Knibb to finish second behind Norway's Solveig Lovseth, who claimed her first Ironman world title. Charles-Barclay, the 2023 champion, was leading after 10 miles of the marathon but visibly began to struggle as temperatures pushed 28C with 70% humidity. She eventually pulled out with about nine miles remaining after consulting with her husband at the side of the road. That seemingly left the path clear for Knibb to take the title, but the 27-year-old withdrew with four miles left, sitting down on the tarmac as Lovseth and Matthews ran past her. Matthews finished strongly and completed the marathon in a course record two hours, 47 minutes, but it was not enough to reel in Lovseth. The Norwegian crossed the line in a time of eight hours, 28 minutes and 27 seconds, with Matthews just 35 seconds behind for her third Ironman silver medal. Germany's Laura Philipp was more than eight minutes further back in third. ""I worked really hard and I'm very proud of my finish,"" said Matthews. ""I'm happy for Solveig, she was incredible to watch. I had a very up and down day."" The Ironman course consists of a 2.4-mile (3.8 km) swim, 112 miles (180 km) cycling  and the final marathon, which is 26.2 miles (42.2 km), for a total distance of 140.6 miles.

c8fa3d061b30,The stats that say Haaland will run away with Golden Boot,,"Of course, injury could definitively intervene in the destination of the Golden Boot,  but there are two reasons why Haaland is such a strong favourite for the award so early. First, the number of goals he has already scored - and, just as importantly, the number and quality of chances he is getting. And second, the slow start his usual rivals for the prize have made. A player's expected goals number (xG) signifies how many goals a Premier League player has historically scored from the number and quality of chances he has had. It is not a number randomly picked by statistics boffins, but by Premier League history. And if we look at players' xG in the Premier League so far this season from normal play, the Norway forward is getting so many more good opportunities to score than anyone else. Indeed, even if Haaland were no better at finishing chances than anyone else in the league, he would still have scored more than twice as many goals as everyone else.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdjz1py0xg7o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/8a7e/live/fb818410-a5dd-11f0-8fc6-8d89d06fa925.jpg,2025-10-11T05:27:03.238000+00:00,26c5bf68ffa6ba5a156131389d26abeac44fd2a3
192dfa7fa05f,Why LA28 is 'just the start' in GB's Olympic dream,,"After finishing seventh at last year's World Championships, then fifth at this year's World Games, GB women retained their European title in Paris last month. Last December, the British American Football Association (Bafa) also received funding from UK Sport for the first time, with Â£500,000 being put towards the development of an Olympic performance programme. That, along with investment from a private benefactor, has allowed Bafa to provide GB players with better support services than ever before and, for the first time, to cover most of their expenses for travelling to this year's events in China and France. After receiving another Â£500,000 from Sport England, Bafa has launched a new strategy to develop the UK game's governance, infrastructure and participation pyramid, which now includes more than 10,000 players and 150 clubs. And since the women's team became back-to-back European champions, more potential sponsors have expressed their interest. ""It's similar to rugby - look what the success of England's women has done for them,"" said Chad Ehlertsen, who became Bafa's chief executive last year. ""I've tried to change the mindset across the group, to make it less focused on winning and more about developing the right culture and values. But if we're getting short-term success it only helps us ensure that flag will be here for the long term and that GB will perform at a high standard."" There was not a men's event at this year's World Games but, after finishing 10th at last year's World Championships, GB's men finished fourth at the Europeans, meaning both GB teams qualified for next year's World Championships in Germany. ""That could be an early qualification route for the Olympics,"" Ehlertsen said.

Manchester United were dominating English football. Hatton was playing his part in the ring and also giving his Manchester City-supporting backers something to cheer while their team struggled in the Red Devils' shadow. In the city centre, a new venue opened and staged a Torvill and Dean performance on its opening night. ""It was fortunate that they built the Manchester Arena when they did,"" said Speak of the indoor venue that welcomed its first customers in 1995. This is where Hatton had 15 of his professional fights. ""It would become his fortress,"" Speak said. By the time Hatton fought Kostya Tszyu in 2005, he was selling out the arena. Hatton stopped the man who was regarded as the world's best light-welterweight to win the IBF title. Danny Jackson, a close friend to Hatton and Manchester City's matchday announcer, delivered an emotional speech in memory of his pal at the recent City-United derby. He gives Hatton credit for putting his beloved football club - now giants of the world game - in the spotlight. ""You look at Rick's time as a boxer, there wasn't a lot to like about City then,"" Jackson said. ""Rick was a bit of a shining light in that period. He got City's brand out there to millions of people."" Retired world champion Anthony Crolla described the Tszyu fight as ""one of the greatest nights Manchester has ever had in any sport"". The next day, Hatton set up camp at the New Inn in Hyde for what had become a regular celebration â nicknamed the not-so-nice shirt nights. ""He didn't want to swan off to celebrity hotspots; he wanted to be around his mates and having a laugh,"" said Jackson. Paul Smith, the Liverpool world title challenger who trained alongside Hatton, remembers one fancy dress party when Hatton dressed as 'Ginger Spice' Geri Halliwell. Those kind of images would get out and help to keep Hatton in the hearts of those from Manchester, because they could see he was one of them. That never changed. This summer, Hatton attended a friend's stag do in Portugal. They set him up by giving him dissolvable swimming shorts to wear in the pool. ""There were a group of lads there from Leeds by the pool idolising him and they were saying 'I can't believe you're doing this to a superstar',"" said Jackson.

There were rumours he would attend parties or go shopping instead - but Landvreugd said that was not true. ""He was in Amsterdam with people working for his clothing company,"" said Landvreugd, who currently manages Den Bosch. ""It took a lot of time off him. He flew over one day or two days mostly doing that and nothing else."" Landvreugd and Schreuder, both popular figures around the club, would take charge of games Davids missed. Fairclough explained: ""The players didn't know what was going on. They didn't know who was manager and who was the coach, who was going to take the next training session."" Hyde tells a story of Davids sitting on the coach ready for an away game, before discovering it was going to take five hours. ""He shut his laptop, picked it up and walked off the coach,"" he said. Davids' camp say this was before the Chester game on 18 January 2014. ""There was another situation that happened just before the team was about to leave on the coach, which was actually the final straw,"" a representative said. The fans loved Davids but grew frustrated with him missing games - and Kleanthous asked him if he could commit fully to going to every game. His exit was announced hours after Barnet lost 2-1 at Chester leaving them 10th in the table. Kleanthous accepts Davids had ""started to lose interest"" at this stage. ""He'd become less committed in my opinion and at that point it was time to shake hands and call it a day,"" said Kleanthous. Hyde added: ""It's funny if it happens once, but two or three times and you get beaten, and it's your livelihoods, then it's not funny anymore. ""We've got a manager who doesn't turn up. In professional football, I don't think that's ever happened."" Davids left Barnet with 25 wins in 68 games as a manager, plus one goal and five red cards in 39 games as a player. Kleanthous concluded: ""I look back on those as great times and I have nothing but respect for what he did. ""He came in, asked for nothing, worked his hardest, did his best and was a little bit unlucky in the end."" Landvreugd and Schreuder were named joint-managers after Davids' exit, but just two months later were replaced by Martin Allen. Davids' only managerial job since was six months in charge of Portuguese third-tier side Olhanense in 2021. He was the Netherlands assistant manager at the 2022 World Cup.

5fc2562ff7cd,'The players will decide' - where next for rugby's civil war?,,"""I think the battle lines have been drawn publicly and everyone knows where the unions stand,"" says sports lawyer Ben Cisneros of Morgan Sports Law. ""The main thing everybody is seeking is a clearer understanding about what the competition looks like and what the future holds. ""If players are going to be entering into new contracts with clubs within this new entity, there are going to need to be a number of assurances that they'll want to have about the viability of the competition, whether indeed it is going to happen, the opportunity to play and be paid and of course to have assurances around matters such as player welfare issues around anti-doping etc. ""I think all parties are right to be raising those questions, including the unions. They've identified that there is a lack of detail out there."" A ban on players representing their country and playing for R360 is one clear detail, but, could that be challenged? ""What the European courts have said is that if you're going to have rules about whether new competitions are going to be sanctioned and whether players can participate in them while remaining part of the eco-system, they have to be clear, objective, transparent, proportionate, and non-discriminatory,"" said Cisneros. ""That's something the lawyers will be scrutinising and whether any potential competition law issue could be justified is another thorny question. ""Recent judgements have suggested a tightening up and applying a more orthodox approach to sport from a competition law perspective. ""So if the rules or the lack of rules is found to be an issue from a competition law perspective then it might be quite difficult for the governing bodies to justify bans. ""It wouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility that rugby might be headed for legal action."" A comment below Mitchell's LinkedIn post suggested the same.

2b57d213939c,How Broncos and 'play-dough' quarterback can end Chiefs' reign,,"New tight end Evan Engram has stepped up big and new running back JK Dobbins is a guy they believe in. He's currently fifth in the NFL for rushing yards (402) and tied-fourth for rushing touchdowns (four). I love that head coach Sean Payton has ""RUN IT!"" at the top of his playcall sheet. , external That shows how the Broncos are a team that wants to run first, because you can do a lot off the back of that. It slows down the pass rush and keeps you in favourable down and distances. It's also helped quarterback Bo Nix, who came into the league as the 12th overall draft pick last year, throwing 29 touchdown passes â second only to Justin Herbert for the rookie record (31 in 2020). Josh Allen and Herbert have the arm strength to throw anywhere, but they don't move in the same way as Nix. He has incredible arm talent, which is different, and he is so athletic. His strengths are his mobility, being able to throw on the run, and finding different arm angles to make the pass when he rolls out of the pocket, the bootlegs. He can throw that layered pass across the middle or over the corner. For a young quarterback, at 25, he's got a lot of poise in the pocket and isn't really fazed by the blitz. He tries to avoid a sack as much as possible and is able to throw under pressure. He has a high football IQ and is very decisive. When you constantly run the ball it eats up the clock and forces the defence to be on the field for longer, and when you've got an athletic quarterback the defence has to cover the field vertically and horizontally. It can be exhausting. Nix has bitten back at Payton on the sideline sometimes and I think the coach likes that attitude, that he's such a competitor. I think it's fun for him to have a young quarterback who's kind of like play-dough. He can really build something up the way he wants to build it. I think it's a special experience for him. Payton has won a Super Bowl and now passed Bill Parcells for career NFL wins (173 - tied 14th overall). He's seen it all. I think the success Denver are having on offence is mostly down to his leadership, his play-calling, his situational awareness â and the combination with Nix helps make him what he is. You wouldn't want a better guy in your ear, to help you through some of the tougher situations and build confidence. I believe in Denver's defence, in Bo Nix's tenacity and composure. But are they good enough to go against an elite team at its best? Because that was not a Super Bowl performance by the Eagles last Sunday. Right now, I don't think the Broncos are incredible. They're working above average, which is a good place to be in their division. All they need to do is maintain this trajectory. They're really good at leaning into their strength, which is running the ball, and that's exactly what they should do against the New York Jets at Tottenham. It's going to be the JK Dobbins show, essentially. The Jets have allowed 140 rushing yards per game (sixth worst in the league), five rushing touchdowns this season (10th worst), and they're the only team yet to win a game. Since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933, the Jets are also the first team to be without a single takeaway through five games, which is kind of shocking when you think that their new coach Aaron Glenn was defensive co-ordinator at the Detroit Lions.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cwyr4ggqlxgo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/2ea4/live/1b412920-e470-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.png,2025-10-09T08:07:39.845000+00:00,d9d9cd2981177d481238fd9da66ca84419a34dba
b5f310402730,,,"Like many expats in Saudi Arabia, Plumptre lives in a gated community known as a compound. These residential compounds offer a lifestyle more like Western suburban areas and have gyms, pools, restaurants and other amenities in a self-contained area. Some even have unofficial bars which serve alcohol, which is banned in Saudi Arabia. Plumptre says she feels happier and safer as a woman living in Jeddah than she did in the UK. ""I know international players, members of my family and friends who have come out here who genuinely feel safer here and calmer than in the UK,"" she said. ""A friend of mine who was out here, we described it as being like a peace bubble. ""I'll give an example. I had been to the supermarket and I had all these bags. I live in a compound. I had to take all these bags into the elevator, so I left my car out with the door open, engine on and keys in the car so I could take up my shopping. ""In the UK I would never leave my car out with the keys in. Here I have no problem. ""Naturally everyone is a bit fearful walking around at night, but I don't have to check my shoulder all the time. I know this is just the perspective of myself, not of everybody who lives here, but with the safety I feel I can't agree with some of the views the Western world have of this place."" As Plumptre says, this is just one perspective on life for a woman in Saudi Arabia. Some of the most notably unequal practices in the country are no longer in place. Women have been allowed to drive since 2018. A year later those over 21 could apply for a passport. But the concept of guardianship, or 'wilaya', is central to Saudi culture. Traditionally every woman has a 'wali', a male guardian who makes decisions on her behalf. There has been some reform - women over 21 no longer need approval to access healthcare or education - but reports from organisations such as Amnesty International say this is not always practically implemented and women are still heavily restricted in what they can do, wear and say. Asked about how she has been treated since her move, Plumptre says: ""I don't feel threatened at all here. ""Men are encouraged to treat women a certain way, and there are consequences if they do not. ""Every woman can say there is a level of fear within them if they were to be out walking at night whether in the Saudi or in the UK, but there are levels of fear, and there are lower levels in Saudi based on the way men behave.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c99gl941vedo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/76a6/live/99881260-9f7f-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-07T06:38:54.091000+00:00,d6cbe3d34b4131f9bdec5fa5f1f6d497f7034f8f

By the time the semi-professional league came to an end, she had scored 18 goals in 11 games and it would be the last time playing club football in her home country. That summer she moved south of the border, to Penn State University in Pennsylvania. Again, her time there was fleeting. Despite arriving at Penn State with a serious cruciate ligament injury, sustained at the Under-20 World Cup, and a frail run of form, the calls from Europe arrived by the end of her freshman year. ""It was neat to watch her be able to be an 18-year-old because I don't think there's been a lot of times where she's been able to be her actual age,"" said former Penn State University head coach Dambach. ""Since leaving Penn State she has put herself out there and put herself in uncomfortable situations and I think through those she was able to really grow and develop."" And so, one year on from that season in Canada, she had left college and moved to Portugal to join Sporting, despite heavy interest in France and England. Batlle y Font was instrumental in persuading Smith to move to the relatively obscure Portuguese league - and reaped the rewards. ""I won't say that our project is better than those clubs, obviously it's different,"" said the 30-year-old. ""I think she understood that we really wanted her. ""I think that she chose us because she understood that she would have the same rights and same duties as other players, but she would not be one more player. ""Once she made the decision, we never felt that she was looking at us as a minor club, compared to the other clubs interested in her."" It did not take her long to make an impression in Portugal. ""She was 18 and she was playing against experienced players and she would make a bit of a fool of them. ""When she played we would look at each other and say, 'how did we fool this girl to be here? How lucky are we?'"" Again by the end of another fruitful season, she was packing her bags and Batlle y Font was receiving enquiries from multiple clubs in Europe.

7791bb4965da,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark side",,"Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark side Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity Traitors The Traitors, at its heart, is a game of lying and deception. The celebrity edition of the hit BBC show began this week, and with it a murdering spree. For the first, it was Alan Carr in the kitchen with the poisoned lily. Just as in the regular series, we find a bunch of people attempting to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth, while faced with the enormous uncertainty of being ""killed"" off. On this occasion, the victim was singer Paloma Faith. She was unimpressed to be bumped off by Carr, who is her friend - or so she thought. So why have so many viewers taken the show to their hearts, and what does it say about our human nature? For Richard Wiseman, professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, such treachery ""feels a bit like everyday life"". ""You're trying to figure out which of your friends and partners and colleagues may not be entirely straight with you,"" he tells BBC News. Deception, he says, ""is in our DNA"" as something we do from around the age of three. ""As soon as children master language, they start lying,"" adds Prof Wiseman. ""If we were radically honest with one another all the time, then we'd probably break apart as a society fairly rapidly. So on one level, deception holds us together."" The problem, he adds, is that it can also be used in an ""exploitative way"", as anyone who tuned in this week to find current Celebrity Traitors Alan Carr, Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross scheming so splendlidly will testify. ""It absolutely fascinates us... you've got that microcosm, you can see all of that being played out in a rather fun way."" The hardest thing with lie detecting is knowing how people behave normally, according to Prof Wiseman, who has written about the psychology of magic and illusion, deception, luck and self-development. ""What we're quite good at is, when it's friends and partners, we know their truthful behaviour,"" he says. ""And you're looking for people departing from that."" For example, when TV presenter Kate Garraway stood accused of being a potential traitor for her excessively theatrical reactions, she defended herself by explaining she was always ""a ham"". ""Now, you have to know her to know how she behaves normally to know whether this is deceptive or not."" Prof Wiseman thinks the faithful stars are going wrong by so far basing their assumptions on what people do and say, when ""the best signals are what people don't say and don't do"". ""Liars tend to be pretty quiet,"" he says, noting the difficulties of that with ""a bunch of celebrities"" who will be ""used to being centre of attention"". Singer Burns, one of the traitors, told viewers she planned to ""lay low"" and go ""under the radar"", and it seems to be working so far. Good liars also tend to be intelligent, Wiseman says, citing salespeople, politicians and - ahem - performers among those who will be ""pretty high self-monitors"". ""Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross are very used to interviewing people,"" he says. ""And used to interviewees who will be somewhat elusive."" Host Claudia Winkleman oversaw the celebrities as they dug their own graves in episode one So do actors and performers like those on this show make better liars than previous contestants? Not according to one of the current faithful, actor and presenter Stephen Fry, who told the Radio Times : ""Actors are terrible liars! It's not an actor's job to lie. It's an actor's job to tell the truth."" But was he telling the truth or lying? Jake Brown, joint winner from series three, told BBC Breakfast he thinks professional performers ""know how to deceive, they know how to be someone else"". Series three finalist Alexander Dragonetti tells BBC News that anyone hoping to rely on their acting skills to win will have to be ""incredibly consistent"" and do it ""perfectly day after day"". ""If anyone sees even a small chink in your armour, they'll think you're playing a game and they'll get rid of you,"" he says. ""So if you do act, this is going to be the test of your life. You're going to have to do it perfectly day after day. ""And the days are long, the pressure is huge, and holding up that kind of act for any period I think is going to be incredibly hard."" 'The illusion of co-operation' On the latest episode, beloved veteran actress Celia Imrie was seen telling her fellow participants: ""People think I'm nice, but I'm not."" For clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Susan Young, the celebrity edition of the show adds an extra level of deception and intrigue due to the professional ""impression management"" of pre-existing personas. Viewers ""project pre-existing beliefs"" on to the stars because ""these are people who we feel we know"", she tells us. But in reality we ""can't tell where the performance ends and where it begins"". As ""voyeurs of morality"", she adds, ""we can't wait for the nice person to do something unexpectedly"". The group dynamic is what interests Dr Young most because what lies beneath is an inherent ""double bind"". ""Everyone must lie"", she says, because ""to be honest is dangerous""; and yet ""lying corrodes the team"", which is much-needed to complete tasks. ""What the show does here, it exposes the illusion of co-operation and that's in so many systems. It's in our workplaces, it's in politics, it's in friendships under stress,"" she says. ""At the end of the day, given certain circumstances and under certain pressures, altruism will thin and self-interest surfaces."" She adds: ""It's almost like a social experiment, it's mirroring how quickly loyalty will collapse when incentives change."" Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, reckons The Celebrity Traitors is on course to be ""one of the biggest shows of the year"". Two years ago, she recalls, she attended an industry seminar where producers said they had resisted the urge to include celebrities in the original show because they thought it was more interesting to select people who did not have public reputations to keep intact. But that was then, and this is now. The great paradox of a new celebrity version, she smiles, is that none of their careers and reputations ""count for anything come nightfall"". ""The further they get into the game, the more of the celebrity trappings get left behind and the less important their fame becomes, which means it really doesn't matter that they're celebrities at all."" Frost thinks it was an ""incredibly ingenious decision"" to make Carr a traitor ""because he's giggly and extrovert and doesn't seem to be able to ever filter what he says or keep a secret"". ""Making him a traitor has really upped the stakes."" She feels Carr's repuatation as a bubbly, chatty man has been ""weaponised"" to enable him to get away with murdering his mate in plain sight. He did seem a bit cut up about it afterwards, mind you, when he met up again with his fellow traitors. But as Ross reminded him: ""You're not a bad person. You're a good traitor."" The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer .

25a17ebaba39,New James Bond producer up for the ‘challenge',,"New James Bond producer up for the ‘challenge' Lizo Mzimba Entertainment Correspondent, London Film Festival Getty Images David Heyman is co-producing the next Bond film One of the producers of the next James Bond film says he is ""very excited to embrace the challenge"" of taking the franchise forward following its sale to Amazon MGM. David Heyman spoke briefly about how the film was progressing under its new owners while on the red carpet at the London Film Festival with 007 co-producer Amy Pascal at the UK premiere of their latest movie Jay Kelly. ""It's going to be a lot of fun, and I think we're going to make something very special,"" Heyman told the BBC. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson agreed earlier this year to sell creative control to Amazon - reportedly for $1bn (£760m). Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight will write the forthcoming film, which will be directed by Dune's Denis Villeneuve. However, the new James Bond actor is yet to be confirmed. Heyman said: ""It's early days. I think we have a magnificent director, a wonderful writer. And it's great to be working with Amy Pascal as a partner on this odyssey."" He added: ""It's a tall order. Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson did such a remarkable job over the years."" Heyman is best known for producing all eight Harry Potter movies, as well as the three Paddington films. Amy Pascal produced the three Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, as well as the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse and its sequel Across the Spider-verse. The new film he made with Pascal was screened at the Royal Festival Hall. Jay Kelly stars George Clooney as the title character - a movie star in his 60s looking back at his life and career, and re-examining how the choices he made have affected his family. Heyman previously worked with Clooney on the Oscar winning sci-fi drama Gravity. ""He's just a wonderful actor, this part is particularly brave. He's going to very uncomfortable places, exposing some really vulnerability. Because the film is also very much about the facades we put on in our lives."" 'Looking forward' EPA/Shutterstock George Clooney on the Jay Kelly red carpet with his wife Amal Clooney The Oscar winning actor was also on red carpet, and explained that while he's a similar age to his character, he feels he hasn't made the same misjudgements. ""It's about sacrifices we all make,"" Clooney says. ""The character I play, he's got a lot of regret. And I don't really have quite that much regret, I've had a fairly full life. I have great friends and great family. So I feel very lucky to have pursued my career in the way that I have."" In the film, Jay Kelly is looking back on his career, but Clooney says he is still looking forward, with things progressing on what will be his fourth film in the Ocean's 11 series, Ocean's 14. ""We got our budget approved, so now we've just got to find a date when everybody's available which Is a little bit of a trick. But we're getting to work on it."" 'Oscar buzz' Getty Images Adam Sandler who plays Jay Kelly's long suffering manager, with his wife Jackie Sandler Jay Kelly also stars Adam Sandler as Clooney's long suffering manager. He says he was able to draw on his past experiences to explore the role. ""Like everyone in the world you have good friends, you have people you believe in [that] you love. And my character gets to believe in my friend Clooney. ""I think he's a very funny, good, giving man. And I know him over the years, and this is the first time I ever got to sit and hang out with George for long sets of time, and we had nothing but fun."" Sandler's performance is already drawing Oscar buzz, but he says right now it is not something he is giving too much thought to. ""That's a very interesting thought. I don't know. I don't really think about that stuff,"" he says. ""People have mentioned nice stuff about our movie, and I'm proud of that.""

Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival in Berkshire, Queen Camilla affectionately recalled an anecdote about Dame Jilly. ""She came to a party here a few years ago where, I hope, she uttered her immortal line, 'I'm going to get so absolutely plastered tonight, darling. I love you so much, I want to see two of you',"" she said, to laughter in the room. ""Dear Jilly, how we'd love to have seen just one of you here with us today."" The Queen also revealed that the Vesper Martini, which was invented by author Ian Fleming as James Bond's drink of choice, was a favourite tipple of the ""much missed"" Dame Jilly. At the event, Queen Camilla met the festival's founders and panellists. She then officially opened the festival, delivering a speech before a panel discussion on the importance of reading and studying literature. Queen Camilla then hosted a reception in the French Dining Room, with attendees including Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin. Earlier in the week, Queen Camilla led the tributes to Dame Jilly, who died after a fall. In a statement, she said she hoped her hereafter would be filled ""with impossibly handsome men and devoted dogs"". Since Dame Jilly's death, there has been an outpouring of love for her. Many of the themes that dominated her so-called bonkbusters - sex, affection and horses - have been central to those tributes. At the festival, others shared their love and affection for Dame Jilly. Speaking to reporters, Sir Ian said he had read her novel Rivals and ""loved it"". He said he had met her multiple times, and that they had kept in touch. ""I got lovely letters from her, long letters and cards and everything , I think my wife was quite worried at one point,"" he joked. He added that she was a ""terrific writer,"" while Sir Salman simply said it was ""a sad loss"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9gql9dr3o,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9112/live/19892850-a6a1-11f0-a409-e197032d359e.jpg,2025-10-11T13:30:59.628000+00:00,db02ed176efe0ed07603389065331daeb3f66abb
29b9dc5b6b21,Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art',,"Wolf Alice: 'A good album is one of the highest forms of art' Mark Savage Music Correspondent BBC Wolf Alice at the BBC in August 2025 (left-right): Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey and Ellie Rowsell Wolf Alice are in a class of their own when it comes to the Mercury Prize. Last month, they received their fourth consecutive nomination for the coveted music award thanks to their new album, The Clearing. That's something no-one else has ever achieved. Not Arctic Monkeys, not Radiohead, not Pulp. What's more, they've done it with their first four albums. ""For some reason, it makes me feel really anxious,"" admits singer Ellie Rowsell, speaking to the BBC from Nashville, where the band are in final rehearsals for their world tour. She's speaking from experience. When Wolf Alice won the Mercury Prize for their second album, Visions of a Life, in 2018, Ellie struggled to gain her composure at the podium. ""I'm so nervous,"" she exclaimed, her hands shaking, before bandmate Theo Ellis stepped in to finish the speech. To fans, Rowsell's jitters might have seemed strange. On stage, the singer is normally a fireball of intensity, screaming punky anthems like Yuk Foo and commanding the spotlight with magnetic charisma. But their more intimate songs portray her as an habitual outsider who doubts her own abilities and motivations. On Thorns, the pensive opening song of The Clearing, she even berates herself for ""making a song and dance"" about the break-up that inspired Wolf Alice's previous album, Blue Weekend. ""I don't know if I'm shy. I think I'm socially inept,"" she recently told Canadian DJ Tara Sloane . ""I'm very confident in some things, but I'm not the loudest person in the room."" The band won the Mercury Prize in 2018, beating other shortlisted artists including Arctic Monkeys, Noel Gallagher and Lily Allen Her nerves about attending another awards show is understandable, then. But Rowsell is also ""grateful and happy"" to be included on the Mercury shortlist again. They will find out if they have won when the ceremony takes place on Thursday. ""We take albums pretty seriously,"" says guitarist Joff Oddie, speaking from his home in London (he's sitting out the US tour because his partner is about to give birth to their first child). ""In our world, a good album is one of the highest forms of art. People can do good songs, or a great live performance, and those are all great signposts. But, for me, a really great album is an incredible feat... if you can pull it off."" That's why the band have signed up as ambassadors for National Album Day, which takes place on Saturday, 18 October, with special events around the UK and limited edition vinyl re-releases of classic records by Liam Gallagher, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop. Asked to name their favourite albums, however, and Wolf Alice are evasive. ""I don't know what my absolute top three would be,"" says Rowsell. ""But if I can re-listen to an album top to bottom over and over again, that's a telltale sign - because it's hard to keep your attention."" PA Media The band's third album, 2021's Blue Weekend, saw them rise to festival headliner status The singer - who reveals Pink's Missundaztood was the first album she owned - eventually settles on The Streets' A Grand Don't Come For Free as an example of ""a perfect album"". ""I feel like it's one of those albums where, even if it's not to your taste, you can actually appreciate the artistry,"" she says. ""I'm not really that into concept albums, but it's got an amazing story from beginning to end - and it never compromises the songs,"" agrees Oddie. The guitarist also chooses Brian Eno's ambient classic Music For Airports as one of his Desert Island Albums. ""I've spent most of my adult life in transit, and it's a beautiful record for zoning out the outside world,"" he says. Shape shifters They collectively agree that 1966's The Velvet Underground & Nico is a must-have for any serious music fan. ""It's one of the most important alternative records of all time,"" says Oddie. ""It's got incredible songwriting, the songs stand up on their own, but they're cloaked in really avant-garde sounds and techniques. ""As a guitarist in an indie band, if you can write incredible songs and play them interestingly, then you're part of that lineage."" The variety of their tastes - Rowsell also selects the mutant folk of Lankum's 2023 album False Lankum - is the key to Wolf Alice's shape-shifting sound. Getty Images After forming as folk duo in 2010, Wolf Alice became one of the UK's biggest indie bands They started out as a folk duo in 2010 but quickly expanded to a quartet, adopting an alt-rock style characterised by Oddie's textured guitar work, the rhythmic interplay between bassist Ellis and drummer Joel Amey, and Rowsell's cutting lyricism. In the early stages, Oddie says, they were ""just muddling through"". ""We had no idea, from a technical perspective, of what we were doing. ""We worked with some brilliant people that were, in hindsight, very, very patient with us. ""It was probably a nightmare to make a record [with us] at that time because we had an idea of what we wanted to sound like, but we didn't know how things worked."" Each album marked a progression. Their 2015 debut My Love Is Cool wrapped ethereal indie anthems in barbed-wire guitar riffs; 2017's Visions Of A Life produced their biggest hit, the delirious synth-driven Don't Delete The Kisses , as well as winning the Mercury; and 2021's Blue Weekend added a sweeping, bruised grandeur to their sound. The Clearing, which topped the UK album chart in August, marks their boldest evolution yet - embracing the nostalgic sounds of 1970s FM pop radio, earning comparisons to The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan. Rachel Fleminger Hudson / RCA Records Wolf Alice are embracing the iconography of 1970s rock bands on their new album ""Maybe in hindsight it was a bit of a stylistic turn,"" says Rowsell. ""But it didn't feel too drastic at the time. It just reflected what we were listening to."" Their goal was to make a record that felt good to play live, full of what Oddie calls ""more song-y songs"" like the Blue Weekend track Delicious Things – which has become an unexpected highlight of their live shows. ""That song was a departure from what we'd done before [and] it didn't feel like it was one people would enjoy live,"" says Rowsell. ""But the audience were just as upbeat and excited as when we play one of our rock songs. ""So I was like, 'OK, it's not just fast, loud, heavy music that gets a crowd going'. And that was really exciting."" ""It's a confidence thing,"" adds Oddie. ""Sometimes you feel like you have to make yourself heard by being as loud and abrasive as you can be. ""We were going, 'Oh, we can connect with the audience in a way that's just as impactful, but different'."" The band are currently in the middle of a world tour that hits the UK in November Recorded in Los Angeles with A-list producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beyoncé, Foo Fighters), the album is unapologetically big; brimming with harmonies and hooks and ambition and heart. But the soft rock reinvention caught some critics off guard. While reviews were largely positive, The Quietus recoiled at the lack of heavy guitar anthems in a scathing screed that employed descriptors like ""unintrusive"", ""clunking"" and ""by-numbers detritus"". ""Wolf Alice had the juice. On The Clearing, that juice has abandoned them,"" agreed Soundsphere's Callie Petch . Admittedly, it takes a minute to adjust - but The Clearing is one of those records that reveals new depths and complexity with every listen. The songs might not have the tinnitus-inducing qualities of old favourites like Fluffy or Play The Greatest Hits, but there's a newfound confidence and playfulness amid the calm. That's why, on the album's artwork, Wolf Alice lean into the iconography of 70s rock. Ellis poses in a leather jacket studded with the words Wolf Alice. Rowsell stands in a spotlight, head thrust back as she sings with eyes-screwed-shut intensity. RCA Records The artwork marks the first time the band have taken full portraits for one of their album covers ""On our first two albums, the artwork was just found images,"" says Rowsell. ""And if you can stumble across a photo that represents the music and the lyrics, it's really romantic and amazing."" For this record, however, Wolf Alice called in photographer Rachel Fleminger Hudson – who spent six months trawling through ""thousands and thousands"" of archive images and interviews to create an aesthetic that reflected the band's inspirations and ambitions. ""She was very academic in how she approached it,"" says Oddie. ""There was a lot of leather. A lot."" It all adds up to a declaration of intent. A criticism/compliment that's often been levelled at Wolf Alice is that they're impossible to pin down. Their influences are too broad. Their ideas are too disparate. But The Clearing has a clarity and purpose that suggests they're finally OK with the idea of being a chart-topping, festival-headlining ""big band"". ""Oh, I don't know if we're owning being a big band,"" Oddie demurs. ""I don't think we'd say that. But we are owning being a band, full stop. ""We're leaning into the lore.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmey4pw9vpo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/64d5/live/1dc95f80-a42f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png,2025-10-11T02:34:52.195000+00:00,ef42341c8363d65e81157d1fd362066549d74ad8

MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live will all stop broadcasting after 31 December, the BBC understands. However, the flagship channel, MTV HD, will remain on air, showing reality series including Naked Dating UK and Geordie Shore. The move reflects a shift in viewing habits, with music videos largely consumed on YouTube and social media rather than television. A spokesman for MTV's parent company, Paramount, declined to comment. 'Breaks my heart' Former MTV VJ Simone Angel told BBC News she was ""really sad, and I'm a little bit in disbelief, and I know it's been a long time coming"". ""We need to support these artists and we all need to dance again and listen to music,"" she said. ""And I know we do that online in our own little bubbles, but MTV was the place where everything came together. So it really does break my heart."" MTV launched in the US in 1981 and the fledgling TV channel quickly captured the public imagination by showing pop videos ""on demand"", presented by enthusiastic ""VJs"" (video jockeys), who became almost as famous as the stars they introduced. Groundbreaking moments in its early years included the world premiere of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, a 16-hour broadcast of the Live Aid concerts in 1985, and the birth of the MTV Video Music Awards. A European offshoot launched in 1987 and the UK got its own dedicated channel in 1997 - launching with the video for David Baddiel and Frank Skinner's football anthem Three Lions. Getty Images Katy Perry hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards three times, in 2008, 2010 and 2013 The channel gave early breaks to presenters including Cat Deeley, Zane Lowe, and Emma Willis, and later branched out into original programming with series like Ex On The Beach and Teen Mom UK. Angel, who worked for both MTV Europe and MTV UK in the 1990s, said it was a ""wild"" time. ""It was like being on a school trip without any teachers. We had so much fun,"" she said. ""MTV Europe was really the forerunner to the internet. We were the most widespread TV channel in the world at that point. We had between 100 and 150 million viewers."" 'Shouldn't just be reality TV' She recounted a story that former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev once told the boss of MTV that the channel had an influence on young people in the Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain in the 80s. ""He said, 'Music achieved more than missiles', because MTV Europe was the first channel that showed what Western life was like. It went past all the propaganda and we showed youth culture, and people wanted that. It was incredibly important."" There is still a place for music on TV, Angel believes. ""You've just got to move with the times. To this day, it's one of the most recognisable brands in the world. Why on earth throw that away? It's not thrown away, but it's just reality TV. That's not what MTV is or should be."" Getty Images Justin Timberlake pictured at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 in Copenhagen In 2011, the main MTV UK channel abandoned music videos altogether, pushing all music programming to its sister stations, with the exception of the annual MTV European Music Awards. That ceremony - which was the scene of memorable moments including The Spice Girls' final appearance before splitting up in 2000, and Rita Ora's tearful tribute to Liam Payne last year - is currently on pause. Paramount put the event on ice earlier this year as it pursued a merger with entertainment company Skydance Media. The deal was approved in July , but no decision has been made about the future of the EMAs. Wider layoffs Paramount is also expected to close MTV music channels in countries including Australia, Poland, France and Brazil, according to media reports in those countries. The closures come as the company seeks to cut costs by as much as $500m (£376m) across its global portfolio. In August, it closed Paramount Television Studios, which produced series including action thriller Jack Ryan and children's adventure series The Spiderwick Chronicles. The layoffs also affected MTV productions in the UK, where original shows Gonzo and Fresh Out UK were cancelled. According to the latest ratings from Barb, MTV's music channels continued to attract modest audiences in the UK. MTV music had 1.3 million viewers in July, with MTV 90s attracting 949,000.

82ab954436fc,Gregg Wallace claims BBC caused him 'distress and harassment',,"Gregg Wallace claims BBC caused him 'distress and harassment' Noor Nanji Culture reporter BBC/ShineTV Former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace is seeking up to £10,000 in damages from the BBC, claiming the broadcaster caused him ""distress and harassment"" by failing to comply with his request for copies of his personal data, according to court documents. Wallace is taking legal action against the BBC and BBC Studios after being sacked from the cooking show in July. His dismissal followed a report that upheld more than 40 allegations about his conduct on MasterChef, including one of unwelcome physical contact and three of being in a state of undress. Wallace previously said he was ""deeply sorry for any distress"" he caused and that he ""never set out to harm or humiliate"". The BBC and BBC Studios say they won't be commenting on ongoing legal proceedings. They have filed a defence to the claim, but the details are not yet available. BBC News is editorially independent from the wider corporation. In documents filed at the High Court, Wallace claimed that, in March, he requested ""personal data"" from both the BBC and its subsidiary, BBC Studios, under data protection laws. Both requests for data related to his ""work, contractual relations and conduct"" spanning 21 years. In the court documents, Wallace claimed the BBC considered his request to be ""complex"" and as such requested an extension to the usual one-month deadline to provide such information. In August, the documents said, the BBC emailed Wallace to apologise for the delay and said they were ""taking all reasonable steps"" to process the request in ""a timely manner"", but he still has not received a response. The documents further claimed that BBC Studios told Wallace it was withholding parts of his data on the basis of ""freedom of expression"". But Wallace claimed it had ""unlawfully failed to supply all of the claimant's personal data"" and had ""wrongly redacted"" information. ""By reason of the defendants failing to fully comply with the [subject access request] made by the claimant for his own personal data, the defendants acted in breach of their statutory duty and in doing so caused distress and harassment to the claimant,"" he said. He stated he was seeking damages for ""distress, harassment and loss of amenity not exceeding £10,000"" as well as interest. Wallace is also seeking a court order that the BBC and BBC Studios comply with the requests for his data. Wallace's representatives have been approached for a comment. BBC/Shine TV Wallace had hosted MasterChef for 20 years, but stepped away from presenting the show last year after facing a string of misconduct claims. The show's production company Banijay ordered an immediate inquiry into the allegations, which was conducted by an independent law firm. This summer, the law firm’s report revealed that 45 claims against Wallace had been substantiated. In total, the report said 83 allegations were made against the TV presenter, with the majority of the upheld claims relating to inappropriate sexual language and humour, but also culturally insensitive or racist comments. Following that report, Wallace issued a statement to the PA news agency, saying that ""none of the serious allegations against me were upheld"". A separate claim that his co-host John Torode had used a severely offensive racist term was also substantiated. Torode has said he has ""no recollection"" of the incident. Both presenters were sacked in July.

The ER and Doctor Who star, who is currently competing on Strictly Come Dancing, told the Independent she had a hysterectomy and radiation therapy during her treatment, which finished late last year. ""I had assumed that the way I was feeling was old age, and I just sort of accepted it,"" Kingston, 62, said. ""I thought, 'OK, this is what it's like to be in my sixties.' But a lot of how I was feeling was to do with my illness."" Getty Images Kingston is known for playing River Song in Doctor Who and Dr Elizabeth Corday in ER Kingston said she had been experiencing bloating and aches for some time, but only sought medical help after spotting blood in her urine. ""I never went down the cancer road in my head,"" she said. ""It was a shock, because I have a very positive outlook on life in general. ""Even though my body was telling me there was something very seriously wrong, I kept thinking, 'Oh, I've got a bad UTI or fibroids.'"" She explained that her 2024 was dominated by the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. ""I had a major operation,"" she told the newspaper. ""I had to have a hysterectomy, I had to go into radiation therapy, and that took up a huge part of my life."" The actress recalled that she had suffered a haemorrhage while on stage at Chichester Festival Theatre, something she described as ""shocking"". She appeared in The Other Boleyn Girl at the West Sussex theatre in April and May 2024. After seeking medical attention following the show's run, Kingston was told the cancer was in her fallopian tubes but had not spread to the ovaries. ""The minute I had the operation, I suddenly felt like myself again,"" Kingston said. The actress urged other women not to ignore any signs of ill health, and to have check-ups if they feel anything is wrong.

c7956cbbc702,Drake's lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track is dismissed,,"Drake's lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track is dismissed Nardine Saad Los Angeles and Mark Savage Music correspondent Getty Images A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake and his associates of being ""certified paedophiles"", were ""nonactionable opinion"" and could not be considered defamatory. Drake filed the lawsuit in January accusing Universal Music Group (UMG), the record label behind both rappers, of defamation by allowing the song to be published and promoted, saying it spread a ""false and malicious narrative"". Drake's spokesperson said he will appeal against the ruling. UMG said it was pleased with the outcome and was looking forward to continuing its work with the Canadian star. War of words Not Like Us, which was released in May 2024, was widely seen as the decisive blow in an ongoing battle between the rival rappers. It has become the biggest hit of Lamar's career, having won five Grammys and being one of the most-talked about moments of his Super Bowl half-time show in February. In a 38-page order, Judge Vargas called the row between the rappers ""the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history"". ""The artists' seven-track rap battle was a 'war of words' that was the subject of substantial media scrutiny and online discourse,"" the judge wrote. Getty Images Kendrick Lamar performed Not Like Us during the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, Louisiana. ""Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that 'Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff."" She also noted that, in an earlier song, Drake had ""challenged Lamar to make the paedophilia accusations"" that featured in Not Like Us. On the track Taylor Made Freestyle, Drake used the AI-generated voice of Tupac Shakur to give Lamar advice on how to win the rap battle. ""Talk about him likin' young girls, that's a gift from me,"" the song suggested. ""It is in this context in which such lyrics as 'Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young'   must be assessed,"" wrote Judge Vargas. ""The similarity in the wording suggests strongly that this line is a direct callback to Drake's lyrics in the prior song."" 'An affront to artists' Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, did not name Lamar in the lawsuit. His lawyers accused UMG of launching ""a campaign to create a viral hit"" out of a song that made the ""false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response"". Ruling against Drake, Judge Vargas said listeners would not expect ""accurate factual reporting"" from a diss track ""replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language."" She pointed out that Drake himself had engaged in similar language, quoting a lyric in which the star ""heavily"" implied that ""Lamar is a domestic abuser"", and another where Drake ""raps that he 'heard' that one of Lamar's sons may not be biologically his."" Regarding Lamar's song, Judge Vargas said: ""Even apparent statements of fact may assume the character of statements of opinion... when made in public debate, heated labour dispute, or other circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole."" Responding to the dismissal, a UMG spokesperson said: ""From the outset, this lawsuit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day"". ""We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career,"" the spokesperson added. A spokesperson for Drake said the musician intended to appeal the ruling, ""and we look forward to the Court of Appeals reviewing it"".

The bass player and ""massive-hearted man"" joined the band in 1966 with fellow singer Justin Hayward, following the departure of Denny Laine and Clint Warwick. Birmingham-born Lodge played on songs such as Nights In White Satin, Question and Isn't Life Strange. The family said their ""darling husband"", father, grandfather, father-in-law and brother ""peacefully slipped away surrounded by his loved ones and the sounds of The Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly"". Lodge featured on some of The Moody Blues' best-known work including the psychedelic album Days Of Future Passed (1967), and its follow-up, In Search Of The Lost Chord (1968), which saw the band move towards further experimentation. He also featured on the albums On The Threshold Of A Dream, To Our Children's Children's Children, A Question Of Balance, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour and Seventh Sojourn, which saw the band move into full scale progressive rock. Lodge also featured on 1977's Octave album, which saw the group embrace a more pop-oriented sound and continued to make records with the band until their final studio album December, a collection of Christmas songs released in 2003. Chris Walter/Getty Images Band members Mike Pinder, John Lodge, Graeme Edge, Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward were pictured in 1969 The family said it was ""with the deepest sadness"" that they had to announce the musician had been ""suddenly and unexpectedly taken from us"". ""As anyone who knew this massive-hearted man knows, it was his enduring love of his wife, Kirsten, and his family, that was the most important thing to him, followed by his passion for music, and his faith."" Lodge spoke on a number of occasions about being an Evangelical Christian, saying it helped him to avoid the excesses of rock and roll. In their statement, the family said: ""We will forever miss his love, smile, kindness, and his absolute and never-ending support. ""We are heartbroken, but will walk forwards into peace surrounded by the love he had for each of us. ""As John would always say at the end of the show, thank you for keeping the faith."" Harry Herd/Getty Images Lodge was ""never happier than being on stage"", the family said Lodge was born in Erdington, Birmingham, and attended Birches Green Junior School, Central Grammar School and the Birmingham College Of Advanced Technology. He had been married to his Kirsten since September 1968, who he had two children with. The family said he was ""never happier than being on stage"" and ""adored performing with his band and son-in-law, Jon, and being able to continue sharing this music with his fans"". It gave him ""even more joy to be able to work with his daughter Emily and son Kristian"", they added. The former was referred to on The Moody Blues song Emily's Song, from the album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour. The group continued to perform live until 2018, the same year the band was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr61pyzxpgo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dcfb/live/f0c45700-a5dd-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-10T14:43:43.181000+00:00,628c4357b8e9f4c04cc47fa312ccc8d135a9e0d7

d24fec2cd118,Celebrity Traitors episode two was as killer as Tom Daley's side-eye,,"Celebrity Traitors episode two was as killer as Tom Daley's side-eye Noor Nanji Culture reporter BBC / Celebrity Traitors Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the second episode of The Celebrity Traitors The second episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and Tom Daley giving Kate Garraway a serious side-eye was one of the moments that got viewers talking. The TV presenter is suspect #1 for the Olympic diver, who made zero efforts to hide it during Thursday night's show. At one point, Garraway declares she is ""flabbergasted"" by the first murder. Daley, 31, has no time for it, giving a major eye roll. ""Who uses that word?"" he asks. ""You can't just call someone a Traitor because they have a better vocabulary than you,"" replies comedian Alan Carr, 49. But Daley's not the only one who thinks Garraway could be a Traitor. Throughout the episode, Garraway was accused both by her fellow contestants and by fans online of ""over-acting"". ""Kate Garraway is coming across so suspicious and being so over the top. Even I'm starting to think she's secretly a Traitor and I know she isn't,"" wrote one X user . For entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford, the behaviour seemed to suggest Garraway, 58, was hiding something. Spoiler: she was not. She's a faithful. But when her name was repeatedly brought up by the other celebrities at the roundtable, Garraway was forced to explain herself. Apparently, that's just how she is. ""I'm a massive ham,"" she said. Did Claudia say 'morning' or 'mourning'? Garraway wasn't the only one struggling with her acting skills. Alan Carr - the standout sensation of episode one - was still finding it hard to keep a straight face. As the first episode of the Celebrity Traitors drew to a close on Wednesday night, we were left waiting to find out which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. Would he go through with it? Our hearts, collectively as a nation, were in our mouths. But murder, he did. And not just any murder. He selected singer Paloma Faith, who by his own admission is one of his ""best friends"". The following morning at breakfast, as the rest of the players tried to work out what had happened, he was all over the place - scratching his head nervously, biting his fingers. ""It was a stretch for my acting ability, I don't know how Meryl Streep does it,"" he said. And then we had Jonathan Ross - a traitor - vowing dramatically to avenge Faith. ""It was massive graveside overacting,"" said TV journalist Siobhan Synnot. They may be celebrities, but even so they're not immune from feeling the nerves - and that could explain their poor acting abilities, says Stafford. You can see why ""being in a game set around murder, betrayal and manipulation... would jangle your nerves,"" she explained. Elsewhere, fans online were relieved to know that celebrities are as bad at spelling as previous contestants. When Niko Omilana voted for Tom Daley, he spelled it “DAYLEE”. ""Niko keeping the longstanding Traitors tradition of terrible name spelling at the round table alive and well,"" wrote one X user, adding : ""It's officially Tom Daylee now, any other spelling will not be accepted."" Others said the spelling error was giving Minah vibes, after a player from season three had to correct others for spelling her name as ""Mina"". BBC/Studio Lambert The celebrities took part in a funeral scene after the Traitors were tasked with poisoning a Faithful The celebrities‘ fashion sense is also causing a bit of a stir. Ross didn't hold back - with his fur-trimmed jacket and sunnies in the pouring rain for a funeral scene. The verdict was mixed, with one X user saying he has the best wardrobe, while another argued he looks like ""your least favourite aunty"". Poor poisoned Paloma, meanwhile, told Traitors Uncloaked on BBC Two that she felt sad to be out - not only because of having more to give the show, but also because she had lots of outfits planned. The show ended on a cliffhanger - again - with fans having to wait till next week to find out who has been voted out. And that, too, is causing a stir online. ""So we won't be won't know who gets banished until Wednesday?? As in 7 days???"", wrote one X user , while others simply put a string of crying emojis.

731fe4dd6ad3,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds",,"BBC sacking presenter was 'reasonable', judge finds BBC Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked with BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024 The BBC's decision to dismiss one of its radio presenters has been found ""reasonable"" by a judge at an employment tribunal. Jack Murley, from Bodmin, worked at BBC Radio Cornwall from 2019 until 2024, when he was sacked by the corporation. A hearing in Exeter heard how Mr Murley was dismissed for breaching the BBC's editorial and social media guidelines. The judge, Alastair Smail, said it was ""disappointing to arrive at this position"" given Mr Murley's ability as a broadcaster. Mr Smail added that because presenters for the BBC ""have access to the airwaves"" they are in a ""privileged position"". He found that the decisions made by the disciplinary hearing manager and subsequent appeal hearing manager, who were both senior leaders and experienced reporters, were ""reasonable"". The tribunal heard how from 2022 Mr Murley openly offered his views on social media about the BBC's Local Value for All project, which involved changes to local radio stations and newsrooms, across England. He was taken off air on 30 June 2023 following a heated conversation with his manager , when they discussed his use of social media. Questions were also raised about content in Mr Murley's Loosest Goose feature, a satirical radio segment that included innuendo and was said to breach BBC guidelines. Lack of contrition Mr Murley's lawyer Nick Toms argued his client had believed he was acting within the BBC's guidelines. He added that it had been unfair that the disciplinary process had not considered Mr Murley's unblemished record of 13 years with the organisation. He said when making a decision a fair employer should take into consideration his ""previous good record"". Jesse Crozier, representing the BBC told the hearing the gross misconduct consensus has been reached because of the ""irredeemable nature of the conduct"" and a lack of ""contrition"" from Mr Murley during the disciplinary process. He said the corporation had ""lost trust"" in Mr Murley and this had made a final written warning and the continuation of his role as a presenter ""impossible"". Referring to the positive aspects of the presenter's employment record, Mr Crozier said: ""You can build up your perfect employee but they do one thing that is so grievously wrong, that it doesn't matter what is on that side of the scale, they have to go."" Judge Smail outlined how he had considered the final submissions from both sides before coming to his decision. He said Mr Murley ""adopted a policy of pleading guilty to nothing"" and believed that Mr Murley ""needed to accept those breaches"" of guidelines ""before trust could be rebuilt"". This outcome follows a previous tribunal against the BBC in November 2024 which found Mr Murley's sacking had not been discrimination for being gay or a union representative.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9310jxe300o,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5597/live/75c56650-acd4-11ef-8ab9-9192db313061.jpg,2025-10-10T15:26:30.265000+00:00,6eebdd0b952f70c4645475ee0f846b6a44f4bc66

Mr Westwood is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 10 November. He has been charged with the following offences: In1983, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Fulham area of London. In 1986, a woman in her 20s was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Vauxhall area of London. Between 1995 and 1996, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped in London. It is also alleged that the same woman was indecently assaulted in central London within the same timeframe.

cea4d9bba065,From the fishing trip to a Gavin and Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals,,"From the fishing trip to a Gavin and Stacey film - five things Jones and Corden's book reveals Getty Images Corden says the pair's friendship is one of the things he is most proud of When Ruth Jones and James Corden first met in 2000, they never imagined it would lead to 22 episodes of a record-breaking TV show. The pair were filming Fat Friends at the Crowne Plaza in Leeds and formed an unexpected friendship . Now their book When Gavin Met Stacey is out, revealing how an argument inspired one iconic scene, and a scrapped storyline idea that would have seen Gavin have an affair. The book is a story of love and friendship, and here are some of the things we have learned: 1. The fishing trip scene was filmed - but never made the final cut A video showing unseen material from the infamous fishing trip was previously shown in a Gavin and Stacey documentary For years, the infamous fishing trip involving Bryn and his nephew Jason has been wrapped in secrecy and speculation. In the long-awaited finale, Gwen delivers a line that reignites the intrigue: ""Their trip 30 years ago almost tore this family apart."" That's all we know, along with clues that they were on their knees, it was freezing cold, and whatever happened was ""completely legal in this country"". While fans were given a glimpse of the pair's escapades , in true Gavin and Stacey fashion the secret was never revealed. But during an event to promote their new book Jones and Corden revealed that a scene shedding light on the mystery was actually filmed. It featured Bryn clearing out his home when he stumbles upon a camcorder tape labelled ""The Fishing Trip"". Jason walks in, stunned, and asks Bryn why he still has it. He then requests to watch it, but Bryn refuses. Jones and Corden explained that the idea was for the tape to play and just as viewers brace for the big reveal, the footage fuzzes out and jams. The scene was dropped in the final edit due to time constraints, ultimately leaving the secret safely tucked away with Bryn, Jason… and Dave Coaches. As for what really happened? Jones confessed: ""I have completely stolen James's idea for the answer to what happened on the fishing trip. I say 'I don't know because I wasn't there'."" 2. Row between Corden and Jones led to an iconic scene Getty Images Adrian Scarborough played Pete Sutcliffe and Julia Davis played his wife, Dawn in the series Corden refers to this as the ""Easter egg row"", with Jones saying it is all ""a little bit vague"", but she was travelling up from Cardiff for a writing session for series two and was meeting Corden in London. Jones continues that she had a message from James Thornton, Joanna Page's husband a few days earlier as he had a script idea and asked if she would mind reading it. ""So I texted back to say, 'Oh yes, by all means send me the script and I'll have a look. Don't know if I can help but I'm happy to have a look'."" She continues that instead of sending the text to James Thornton she sent it to Corden, and messaged him saying ""Sorry that wasn't meant for you"". Corden asked who was it for? ""And I don't know what possessed me, but I just went 'Oh it doesn't matter, I cant tell you about it'. And for some bizarre reason you went, 'Oh my god, are you doing Doctor Who?' and I said 'I'm sorry I cant tell you because I've signed a confidentiality clause."" BBC/Baby Cow Productions/Neil Bennett Gavin and Stacey was first screened in 2007 Jones says Corden was furious with her. ""I was basically playing a joke on you, which I rarely do because I'm not really a wind up merchant,"" adding that Corden is. She adds she was enjoying teasing Corden, but then he took it badly and said ""just forget it, I'm going to Benidorm"". Jones said she was really cross, but the pair made up in the hotel bar, and Jones told Corden she was just winding him up, and they went across the road and bought some Easter eggs. Corden said they bought two giant Cadbury's Easter eggs, and lay on the hotel bed, opened them and laid there with chocolate eggs on their faces. ""It was shortly after that we wrote Dawn and Pete's vows, when she changes the words to lyrics of Michael Jackson's 'Ben'. Jones added: ""We had a sugar rush, had a sugar low, fell asleep woke up and wrote the vows scene. ""I remember getting really hysterical writing it. It was absolutely joyous, it was magic."" 3. Stephen Fretwell didn't want his song to be the theme song Getty Images Corden and Jones came up with the idea for the series when they both met when they were filming Fat Friends Corden really loves the Stephen Fretwell album Magpie and for a long time they thought about having a piece of written score as the theme. Corden says: ""A few different people like David Arnold wrote pieces, and wrote one piece with a Welsh harp, it was beautiful but didn't feel right. ""I kept saying how I really love that drum sound and the piano chords on the Stephen Fretwell song Run."" Corden continues that the The Office and The Royale Family inspired them, with both shows having simple title sequences, but Gavin and Stacey couldn't afford one. ""We went with a black card with white writing and I wouldn't change it for the world, and I kept saying 'let's have something that feels a bit like Run' and then in the end it was like 'what if it's that',"" adding that on some level the lyrics in the song feel like Nessa and Smithy's relationship. During the London event, the co-creators of the BBC show also met Fretwell for the first time, where he confessed he has initially told his agent he didn't want his song used for the programme. 4. Corden's 40th birthday in Mexico led to the 2019 special PA Corden and James co-wrote and starred in the series Jones reveals it was Corden's wife Jules inviting her to Mexico for his 40th that clinched the 2019 special happening. Corden said as soon as Jones walked in he burst into tears and was so ""unbelievably happy to see you"". He says they had the ""best weekend"" adding the couple had always laughed about the fact that Jones had sung Wild Thing at her wedding after a few drinks, and one of his greatest regrets was he wasn't there because they didn't know each other. At Corden's 40th, Jones got up and sang Wild Thing, improvising the lyrics to make them specific to Corden. ""I just remember singing and seeing your face. The joy on your face,"" she says. Corden adds: ""Harry Styles was going to you 'I cant believe you just did that',"" with Jones saying: ""Yeah he looked a bit in shock, I don't know if it was in a good way or bad way'."" BBC/Toffee International Ltd./Tom Jackson The series finale aired on Christmas Day 2024 During the trip Corden suggested it ""might be time"" to do more Gavin and Stacey. ""I came back from the Mexico trip in 2018 thinking 'right, lets do this',"" Jones says. As they were writing the 2019 finale, they had the idea of doing two specials, with one being a secret and storyline ideas including Gavin having an affair. ""So the first would air on Christmas Day and the second on New Year's Day, we even thought that the BBC could put something fake in the listings,"" Corden says. But the task was a ""big challenge"" because of the 10-year gap, and the pair thought it would not work. 5. The finale could have been a film in cinemas PA Media The co-creators originally saw the finale as a cinema film, before opting for a 90 minute tv episode The pair reveal that in August 2023 they started talking about doing one more, potentially a film to be released in cinemas - but changed their minds. Corden says: ""The fact is they've always been in the corner of your room and that is where they should remain."" Jones adds: ""When we started the show 20 years ago the idea it would be one of those shows that had a Christmas special was far beyond anything we hever dreamed of. ""Just the notion of BBC One on Christmas Day. That means so much to us."" Corden and Jones said the book came about because they felt it would be nice for fans of the show to find out what their relationship was like and also explore the journey that started back in 2000 in Leeds and ended in Barry last Christmas Corden says they wrote with the same freedom they always had and didn't tell the BBC until they had written 65 pages. The pair added they originally thought the 2019 special would be the ending, had it not had the cliffhanger. ""We knew it our hearts that the absolute had to be that Smithy and Nessa finally got together . Got married."" PA Media The Christmas Day episode in 2024 became one of the most watched scripted TV shows of the century Corden says without Jones passion for Gavin and Stacey he would have let the idea go by the wayside. He says: ""When I think about Gavin and Stacey I think about the word friend and what it means. ""I got to make this show with somebody who knows me better than I know myself... I just don't think I'll have a friendship like it again in my life."" But what next? They're working on something new , and seeing where they go with it. ""Nothing may come of it. That's always a possibility. But I love it,"" says Jones.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy809dgd4zo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5567/live/32604410-a5c7-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-09T17:03:16.321000+00:00,5baf9a82ad9da52becd22e16fda7a2c7a1792afe
7714d1979b59,From Happy Valley to Riot Women: Why writer Sally Wainwright wants to shout about menopause,,"From Happy Valley to Riot Women: Why writer Sally Wainwright wants to shout about menopause Paul Glynn Culture reporter BBC Pictures Amelia Bullmore and Rosalie Craig play two members of the rock band Sally Wainwright has said she aimed to create an ""uplifting"" portrayal of midlife, including the menopause, through the story of a female rock band in her new TV series Riot Women. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Thursday, the Happy Valley writer said the show, which starts on Sunday, draws from her own midlife experiences. ""It's very personal for me this,"" she said. ""It's a lot about what I was going through at what [actress] Tamsin [Greig] very eloquently called 'the middle squeeze'."" She added: ""It's just about midlife - menopause is just an aspect of that - and I wanted to find a way of writing about this part of your life in a way that was uplifting and engaging and interesting."" Getty Images Lorraine Ashbourne, Sally Wainwright, Rosalie Craig, Joanna Scanlan, Tamsin Greig and Amelia Bullmore attended a recent launch for the show She continued: ""It's about women who find something very creative and very engaging to do together and how it changes their lives."" Riot Women tells the tale of five menopausal women who form a punk rock band to take part in a local talent contest. It features stage and screen star Rosalie Craig as the chaotic Kitty Eckersley, alongside an ensemble cast of bandmates including Friday Night Dinner star Greig, Gentleman Jack's Amelia Bullmore, Lorraine Ashbourne from Alma's Not Normal and The Thick of It comic actress Joanna Scanlan. Together the women foster a sense of solidarity and address their experiences candidly. Wainwright, the Bafta-winning writer from Huddersfield, said she'd always wanted to write something as a sort of tribute to the 1970s musical drama Rock Follies. She started to think about it properly about 10 years ago when she working on the one-off BBC drama To Walk Invisible, about the lives and literary achievements of the Brontë sisters. ""At around that time, my mum started to develop dementia, and I felt I was being pulled in so many different directions,"" she explained to presenter Anita Rani. ""I still had two boys at home, one just about to go to university, the other one thinking about what he was going to do, education wise."" She added: ""You know that adage about if something needs doing, ask a busy woman?... I was that woman who just was being expected lots of - in a good way. You're often at the height of your career. ""And so you've been pulled in all sorts of directions and balancing a huge amount of things, and in the middle of that the menopause started."" She noted how along with hot flushes, brain fog and a low mood, it had brought with it a kind of ""low self esteem that you don't expect"". ""It just seemed well worth writing about,"" she said, noting how it had been like ""therapy"" to do so. Rosalie Craig as Kitty Eckersley in the show The writer felt it was neccessary and useful for the cast to learn to play their instruments and perform live for the series, on songs such as Seeing Red and Just Like Your Mother. Craig - who starred in Stephen Sondheim's Company on the West End - told the same programme it was ""phenomenal"" to be asked to portray the carefree and at-times shameless frontwoman, Kitty. ""She's constructed somebody who doesn't have a filter, and that's partly because of what she's been through in life, and being the victim of aggression,"" said Craig. ""She faces the world like that, with two fists,"" she went on. ""She exorcises herself through the use of song, which was really brilliant to do.""

0f862a5c6c94,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start",,"Stars, secrets and slip-ups: Celebrity Traitors is off to a cracking start Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Host Claudia Winkleman said she was initially reluctant to do a celebrity version of the series Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the first episode of The Celebrity Traitors TV shows with famous contestants usually have a loose definition of the word ""celebrity"". But there are no recycled Love Islanders among the 19 stars in the first series of The Celebrity Traitors, which has got off to a cracking start. ""When they came to me and said they wanted to do a celebrity version, I said, 'Oh I don't think we should do that, I like just doing it non-celeb',"" said host Claudia Winkleman at the show's launch, only half joking. ""Thankfully I have absolutely zero power, because they said, 'Well, these are the people who have expressed interest.' And I couldn't believe it."" Granted, it's worth keeping things in perspective. It's not Taylor Swift and Tom Cruise entering Ardross Castle near Inverness. But frankly, if Kate Garraway is on board, so are we. The ITV daytime star was joined by Jonathan Ross, Celia Imrie, Sir Stephen Fry and other familiar names as the series got under way on Wednesday. Here are six highlights from the opening episode. 1. The celebrities want to make each other laugh As you'd expect, the celebrities are extremely comfortable in front of the cameras,  creating a fun new dynamic and giving the show a new lease of life. Many of them already knew each other and had an immediate confidence that the regular contestants don't. All of them evidently know and love the format, and there were some genuinely funny moments as the stars tried to make each other laugh. ""What was your name again?"" joked singer Paloma Faith (a faithful, appropriately) as she introduced herself to her fellow players in the car ""I'm worse than Linda!"" remarked comedian Alan Carr later, referencing the notoriously awful but lovable traitor from series three When TV presenter Clare Balding pointed out that banishments were decided by a vote, Carr told her: ""God, you're looking beautiful today"" Later, Faith brilliantly pretended to drop dead on the round table after drinking an apparently poisoned glass of water just after the traitors had been selected The stars were even happy to make jokes about being traitors. As they left the round table, Sir Stephen shouted: ""Traitors stay behind please!"" while Ross commented later: ""See you in the turret!"" 2. Alan Carr is extremely good value ""You know what celebrities are like: two-faced!"" said Carr during the episode Making the comedian a traitor was exactly the kind of brilliant casting decision we were hoping for. (""How could you not?"" said Claudia.) In the first episode, Carr was panicked, sweating and generally squirming over being a traitor. ""I feel sick,"" he said. ""It's the worst secret ever and it's just burning me, I'm so nervous."" He is a delight to watch - even just the sight of him strolling the corridors with his hood up trying to look menacing makes you laugh. ""I've had to have my cloak taken out because I'm so fat,"" he joked in the first traitors' meeting in the turret. The traitors were completed by chat show host Ross and singer Cat Burns - both of whom seem to have more of the conniving mindset needed for a great traitor. But Carr is the truly inspired choice. ""My aim was to go under the radar, and I think I've pole-vaulted over it,"" he reflected at one point. We're in for some fantastic memes. 3. The celebrities literally dig their own graves Comedian Lucy Beaumont and actor Mark Bonnar failed to find the shields hidden in their graves Instead of the traditional arrival by train, the stars were driven to a graveyard and set an opening challenge that saw them dig through soil in search of six available shields. The lucky recipients included Ross, Garraway, rugby player Joe Marler, comedian Joe Wilkinson and singer Charlotte Church. The sixth shield finder was actress Celia Imrie - albeit helped by Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed. ""My aim was to try and get Celia a shield, because I love her,"" he explained. But this is exactly the sort of kindness that can make people suspicious in this show, so he'd better tread carefully. Messing with the format isn't always a success - who can forget the disastrous ""Seer"" twist that ruined the climax of the last series? - but this was a terrific new task, especially Carr's disappointment that the shield he thought he'd found was actually a rock. 4. Clare Balding is a liability in missions The contestants were challenged to pull a giant Trojan Horse up a hill and through a series of gates that each required a special code, before eventually setting the horse alight. Unfortunately, Balding locked in an incorrect combination at the first gate before the contestants had even begun tackling the puzzle, not realising you only got one chance to enter the code. ""No! I didn't realise I locked it in, sorry!"" she shouted. ""I've made a complete mistake there."" She explained later: ""I thought, oh we can guess lots of numbers, so while they're working that out, I'll just stick a number in."" ""I would've done exactly the same,"" sympathised Winkleman. ""She was mortified, she really was, I felt terrible for her."" The mission raised a few eyebrows - some were suspicious that Church gave up her shield so willingly in exchange for Balding's error, while swimmer Tom Daley suspected Balding might have deliberately sabotaged the task because she's a traitor. Luckily, the rest of the task went well, partly thanks to Mohammed, whom Garraway described as a ""puzzle ninja"". Ultimately the contestants completed the mission, would you believe it, with just moments to spare. 5. It's a whole new ball game with celebrities Some fans were nervous about the celebrity spin-off, but the bottom line is: it works. ""It's not often in our sheltered world that we are put in a position where we have no idea how we're going to react,"" noted Sir Stephen. ""I don't want to incriminate myself, but I've always wanted to murder a celebrity,"" added Ross. But in some ways, the fact that the contestants are well-known makes strategising harder. ""I was thinking about going in speaking Welsh and pretending I've actually been Welsh all this time. Sort of a reverse of Charlotte,"" joked comedian Lucy Beaumont, referring to the last traitor standing in series three. The celebrities are playing for a £100,000 prize for their chosen charity (although they also receive a separate appearance fee). ""You think you know these people,"" Winkleman reflected, ""and then you watch them play this game, and I was awestruck by the way they played it - with empathy, with wit and with real smarts."" 6. The cliffhanger is unbearable Despite its extended running time, the episode ended without a murder or a banishment, leaving us with a huge number of questions. We didn't find out if the celebrities were any better than previous contestants at spelling each other's names at the round table, or whether there would be another outbreak of players telling each other: ""I'm voting for yourself."" But we know there will be drama. ""Did the roundtables get heated? Yes,"" said Winkleman. ""They're polite, but they want to catch the traitors, and the traitors want to remain undetected, and both parties are excellent at what they do."" Sir Stephen's total dismissal of the ""gut instinct"" tactic was particularly refreshing. ""The idea that you can be good at reading people is absolute nonsense, and it's just like astrology or anything else,"" he said before heading into the castle. ""Woo woo. You just can't do it. ""We can all be convinced, even though the facts tell us otherwise. These notions of 'I just knew, it's the way he lifted his glass, his eye doing that thing' – all nonsense."" As the episode drew to a close, the most pressing question was which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight. ""I can't believe they've left me to it,"" he said. ""I have people I want to kill, but it's not going to be easy. What am I going to do?"" We can't wait to find out.

2331035d7c85,From folklore to fashion - how the Armagh Rhymers stole the show at McQueen,,"From folklore to fashion - how the Armagh Rhymers stole the show at McQueen Alexandra Rosbotham BBC News NI Photography courtesy of McQueen The Armagh Rhymers - known for their striking costumes - help to preserve an ancient Irish tradition of masked folk theatre and ritual performances From the ancient Irish practice of mumming to walking the red carpet, the Armagh Rhymers were central to a meeting of myth and couture for McQueen's Paris Fashion Week show. The local theatre and performance group have been committed to carrying the rural custom of ""mumming"" or ""rhyming"" into the 21st century, and in doing so caught the attention of McQueen's creative director, Seán McGirr. Historically, mumming saw groups dress up in masks and costume, going from house to house to perform poetry, theatre, music and dance. Often communities used this to mark important times in their calendar. ""When we got the e-mail in July, we weren't sure it was real. McQueen is such a fashion behemoth, their shows are so beautiful and known for their theatrics,"" said programme manager Clare Jennings. ""The creative director Seán McGirr is Irish and is very inspired by Irish culture, history and heritage, incorporating Irish folklore and mythology in the shows and in the collections. It just seemed like a really natural fit."" Handout Clare has been a member of the Armagh Rhymers for four years The group worked with local straw craft workers to produce large straw maypole toppers which were then used as part of the set. Craft artist Moira Burns hand-made more than 500 harvest knots. Traditionally thought to be a love token, the harvest knots were used as invites for guests. Photography courtesy of McQueen Hessian ribbons and straw maypole toppers made up the set for the show (left) and VIP invites included wheat harvest knots handmade in Armagh (right) Armagh to Paris Clare, alongside Creative Director and co-founder Dara Vallely and board member and volunteer Anne Hart travelled to participate in McQueen's Spring/Summer 2026 show in Paris. ""We were in traditional mask and costume on the red carpet as guests arrived,"" Clare told BBC News NI. ""It was a really an amazing opportunity to showcase the local heritage and craft that we do have here, and for a fashion house like McQueen to see the beauty and the value in our local craft."" Often performing community groups or visiting schools, a haute couture show is a departure from the Armagh Rhymers day-to-day schedule. ""When Dara started the Rhymers nearly 50 years ago now, a lot of these ancient traditions were in danger of dying out or being forgotten about, so we feel very lucky that Seán McGirr was so interested in the ancient tradition of mumming and what we do,"" Anne added.

464832ad9e6c,Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and acting with Sheridan Smith,,"Romesh Ranganathan on overexposure and acting with Sheridan Smith Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Ranganathan will star in a new West End production of Woman in Mind opposite Sheridan Smith Comedian Romesh Ranganathan will make his West End debut later this year, co-starring in a play with Sheridan Smith. But although it's his first time acting on stage, he tells BBC News he's aware of the risks of overexposure. The 47-year-old is already one of the most familiar faces in British entertainment, with a CV that includes The Weakest Link, A League of Their Own, a BBC Radio 2 show, hosting the TV Baftas, and several documentaries and sitcoms. From December, Ranganathan will also appear in a new production of Alan Ayckbourn's Woman in Mind. But taking on new roles isn't without risk, in an entertainment landscape where the public can grow tired of seeing the same stars. ""Well, I just want to put this out there, and I'd love you to publicise this as much as possible: I do say no to stuff,"" Ranganathan jokes to BBC News. ""I'm not just walking around taking whatever's offered. ""The truth is, people say to me 'you're on everything' - that accusation has been levelled at me. ""But I feel like whenever I'm thinking about doing something, I'm just asking, do I think think this will be good, is it something I'd watch, is it something I think I'd be able to do a decent job at? And then, if the answer to those questions is yes, that's what makes you do it. ""I mean, obviously I need a fee as well,"" he laughs, ""there's no point in doing it totally for the love of the game."" Ranganathan hosts TV quiz The Weakest Link (pictured) and a BBC Radio 2 weekend show Many figures at the very top of television - Ant and Dec, Michael McIntyre and Claudia Winkleman - are selective with their choices, notably hosting no more than three or four shows each per year. But when a particular star is in demand, it can be tricky to strike the delicate balance between saying yes to work while not taking on too much. ""I understand the thing about overexposure, but if that happens, it happens,"" Ranganathan reflects. ""I try not to overthink things that much, to be honest. ""You normally just have a gut feeling whether something's good or not or whether you'll be good for it or not. ""But who knows, maybe after this play goes out, the general public might say 'OK we've had enough', and I'll go and work in a café or something."" Ranganathan will join the previously announced Smith in Woman in Mind, which will run at London's Duke of York's Theatre from 9 December until 28 February, before playing additional dates in Sunderland and Glasgow in March. Ayckbourn's psychological comedy follows a woman named Susan, who has an accident that leaves her with a head injury. A new fantasy life emerges in front of her, before the line between her real and imagined lives begins to blur. ""I play her doctor, who basically is the only link between the two worlds throughout the play,"" Ranganathan explains. Sheridan Smith told Radio 2's Scott Mills she was ""so excited"" to be starring in the show Smith shot to fame in the early noughties sitcoms The Royle Family and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, and went on to appear in The Railway Children Return and ITV's Cilla, which saw her portray the legendary British entertainer Cilla Black. But she also has a huge number of stage credits - she led West End hits such as Funny Girl and Shirley Valentine, and has won two Olivier Awards for her roles in Legally Blonde and Flare Path. Announcing her role in Woman in Mind last month, Smith told BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills : ""I'm so excited, this is an amazing part for an actress. ""It's thought of as one of Alan Ayckbourn's finest plays, it's really funny and it's got a lot of darkness as it goes on. ""There are loads of characters, it's just bonkers and brilliant, it's kind of like a big farce. I can't wait to get started."" Working with Sheridan 'exciting but intimidating' Woman in Mind premiered in 1985 and has since been revived in the US and the UK several times. Stockard Channing, Julia McKenzie and Dame Helen Mirren have all previously played the role of Susan. Ranganathan says he and Smith had a text exchange when he was cast, adding: ""It's both exciting and intimidating, because she's obviously incredibly talented, phenomenal at what she does, so it's an honour to be doing it opposite her. ""But also what it means is my abilities will be in sharp contrast to that, so there's a little bit of added pressure. But we're both excited, I've not worked with her before so I'm looking forward to that."" Oliver Rosser Ranganathan (pictured in character with his stethoscope) plays Susan's doctor in the show The comic has previously acted in TV sitcoms such as Avoidance and Romantic Getaway, but this will mark his first time acting on stage. ""Well, since primary school"", he laughs. ""I might have played second shepherd in the Nativity."" Ranganathan says he feels ""nervous"" about his West End debut, but adds: ""It was something I'd been thinking about doing for a while. ""I'd been talking about it for maybe a year or two, my wife is an ex-drama teacher and has a real passion for theatre, so it's something I started discussing, but I didn't know what it would be. This kind of popped up and they were kind enough to let me read for it, and it felt like an opportunity too good to miss."" The new adaptation will be directed by Michael Longhurst, with Ranganathan noting: ""It's going to be very close to the source material, but the way it might be performed and presented might be a little bit different. ""But what I want to do is allay any fears that we might decide to rap it,"" he jokes. ""There's nothing like that in the works.""

ded8eeae477b,How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink,,"How Stacey Solomon decluttered our homes back from the brink BBC Sheeny and Sohan were delighted by the transformation done by Stacey's team Has your home become messy without you even realising? Wanting the next best thing, holding on to things for sentimental reasons or just a lack of time to sort through your space can all mean you end up with too much stuff. Sort Your Life Out hosted by Stacey Solomon helps people declutter and shows the transformational impact that getting rid of things you don't need can have on your family and home. If you're struggling to clear items in your home, here are how three different families  who took part in the series managed it and the one key realisation that helped them do it. For more practical advice on how to clear your space click here I don't want my kids to buy things to feel good Sheeny Aphabhai-Heer lives with her partner Sohan, and children Milly, 22, Leila, 9 and Ethan, 4. The house is piled high with clothes, shoes, suitcases and kitchen equipment, meaning they have to eat separately at mealtimes as there isn't enough space to sit together. This lack of space also means it is a struggle for daughter Milly to work from home. Sheeny had Milly when she was 17 and in a difficult marriage. She managed to leave the marriage and buy her own house as a single mum. ""My mum's a superwoman, she's been through a lot in her life and she came out of there knowing she had to do her best and provide for me,"" says daughter Milly. When Sheeny started to earn money, she wanted things that she could be proud of, and the purchases increased from there. She says she often spends nights scrolling through shopping apps like Vinted, but wants to break this cycle for her kids. ""I noticed a growing trend in Milly and Leila. When something new is happening, they want a new outfit. ""That's my habit. Buying something new to feel good cannot be the legacy I give to my children."" By letting go of her clothes and shoes, Sheeny wants to be an example to her kids, showing that she can change and break the constant cycle of shopping. It was this realisation which enabled the Aphabhai-Heers' to get rid of just over 40% of their belongings. This meant Stacey Solomon and her team were able to transform the dining room with added desk space for Milly to work, and there was also enough space for the family to be able to eat meals together again. ""It's literally changed the dynamic of our family,"" says Sheeny. Giving away my wife's things didn't mean we'd forget her Craig Bufton is a single dad to two daughters, Wren, 4 and Merywen, 6. After Craig's wife Lois gave birth to Wren she was constantly exhausted. Eventually she was diagnosed with cancer, dying just eight months later. As a widowed father, the clutter built up as Craig focused on raising the girls as a single parent. He struggled to tackle the house as he couldn't face dealing with sentimental items tied to Lois, such as storybooks she wrote for the children, photos and a hoard of Christmas items she loved. ""There's just so much sentimental stuff and so many of our plans that aren't going to happen anymore."" His office also got out of control as paperwork piled up, and the living room ended up covered in toys and different hobby equipment. ""It took me a really long time to realise I was buying stuff to just get the dopamine hit out of it. So much of the stuff I have is 'oh this will make me happy' and it did for about 20 minutes."" Craig eventually decided to take action to create a house that was a special and relaxing place for his two daughters to grow up. Craig (centre) and his two daughters Merywen and Wren with the Sort Your Life Out team. The key to doing this was to let go of sentimental items tied to Lois. Stacey and her team encouraged Craig to focus on the items he was keeping because they had real meaning and memories, and not the things he was letting go of. One example is Lois' Christmas baubles, which Craig disliked. Rather than keep them all anyway, he held onto specific baubles for their daughters. Decluttering like this enabled him to downsize his office, creating a space for him to work downstairs instead. And in the place of his office they created a special reading room for the girls. This space meant Lois' love for stories and writing was kept alive, with her books on full display. The family now has the space to eat together, and a room where Craig can read Lois' storybooks to their children. Since this episode aired, Craig has found a new partner and has moved house with his daughters. Other stories you may enjoy Time with my kids was more important than crafting The Clarke family consists of mum Sarah, dad Jon, and children Timeon, 14, Owen, 9 and Caitlin, 11. Sarah is an avid crafts enthusiast, with an abundance of yarn, beads and other art materials in her home. Currently, her younger children, Owen and Caitlin,  share a room, and Sarah's crafts mean that a room that could be used for one of them can't be. The clutter of books, board games and toys in their house means making space for the family to sit and chat together is incredibly hard. Both Sarah and Jon are deaf, and mum Sarah finds making crafts a way for her to destress from everyday life. ""I like making things, it makes me feel good, creativity is therapeutic, it makes me calmer and relaxed."" ""My mum holds everything dear to her heart"" says Timeon. The team found an array of unfinished craft items all over the house, including an unfinished crochet bag from 15 years ago. Sarah feels a lot of guilt because she knew the time with her children was being impacted. ""I do lots with them but it doesn't stop the guilt being real."" Having the team come in helped her realise she had to prioritise time with the kids over her crafts. ""Children grow up faster, and my projects will always be there."" It was this realisation which helped her to let go of half of their items. Owen and Caitlin were able to have their own rooms, as Sarah's crafts were compacted into the living room in a large cupboard.

It was a major moment for Chanel designer Matthieu Blazy,  debuting his first collection for the fashion powerhouse. Harry Potter star Emma Watson was there, along with Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman, who appeared  almost a week after she filed for divorce from musician Keith Urban. Celebrities posed in a room filled with giant planet-like sculptures, some of which hung from the ceiling, lighting up the catwalk. Getty Images Sunday Rose Kidman-Urban, Nicole Kidman and Faith Margaret Kidman-Urban attend the Chanel Womenswear Spring/Summer 2026 show Perhaps wisely, Blazy didn't stray too far from Chanel's classic look with his first collection, which was marked by stylish tweaks to the fashion giant's blouses, suits and tweeds. Getty Images Getty Images Blazy said: ""For this first Chanel show, I wanted to do something quite universal, like a dream, something outside of time, and I was fascinated by the universe of stars, a theme so dear to the House. We all observe the same sky, and I think it provokes the same emotions in us."" Kidman's Australian compatriot and fellow actress Margot Robbie took time to pose in front of the catwalk, wearing a loose black quilted bomber jacket over a black bralette top, paired with wide-leg black trousers. Getty Images Supermodel Naomi Campbell looked the epitome of chic in a monochrome outfit, paired with oversized sunglasses that only an A-lister can get away with. Many attendees stuck to a black and white theme, a classic colour combination that was favoured by Coco Chanel herself and also featured on Monday's runway. Getty Images Actress Tilda Swinton sported a similar look but opted for a black long-sleeved top with a chunky necklace. Getty Images Another Hollywood star in town was The Fantastic Four's Pedro Pascal, who kept it simple with a navy jumper, black trousers and roomy man bag (plus the obligatory indoor sunnies). Getty Images Elvis and Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann sat with Vogue/Conde Naste executive Dame Anna Wintour on the front row, with the pair sticking to the black and white dress code. Getty Images Demi Lovato, attending the Coperni Womenswear show, seemed inspired by the 1980s gymnastic aesthetic, although we wouldn't want to attempt a beam routine in those pointed heels.

e67ac2564fe3,'They operated under a cloud of fear': A secret history of gay people in the US military,,"A unique depiction of military life Now Boots shines a spotlight on the courage and resilience of service members, who sublimated an integral part of their identity in order to serve. Created by Andy Parker, whose previous credits include Netflix's adaptation of Armistead Maupin's LGBT literary classic Tales of the City, Boots is faithful to the spirit of Cope White's book, which is candid, comedic and bigger on positivity than pity. Miles Heizer stars as Cameron, a closeted gay teenager who enlists in a Marine Corps boot camp in a desperate effort to belong – much as Cope White did. ""I know I'm a man, but society was telling me that I was less than [because of my sexuality],"" the author recalls. ""I went into that environment to find my place in the masculine world, even though it's potentially the roughest place to find that."" But at the same time, the eight-part series makes significant changes to the book's scope and setting. Where Cope White began boot camp in 1979, Boots relocates the action to 1990, just four years before ""don't ask, don't tell"" was introduced. If the series is renewed for further seasons, as Parker hopes, this policy should provide plenty of dramatic grist to go with the other storylines. ""Our gay main character certainly has a secret that's very high stakes for him in that environment,"" Parker says, ""but everybody he meets there also has something they're hiding or running from. That commonality felt, to me, like an interesting thing to explore."" Getty Images Gay rights activists in the 1990s protesting against the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy (Credit: Getty Images) Even with its homoerotic frisson, this sense of absurdity reflects what was a desperately sad and destructive real-life situation for many service members. ""Some of the former marines who worked on this series [as historical advisers] aren't gay, but they found these policies just as absurd [as their gay counterparts],"" Parker says, pointing to the way they seemed ""completely counterintuitive to the social cohesion"" at the core of military life. Cope White says his main reason for leaving the Marines after six years of service was the constant toll of lying – something Cameron has to navigate throughout the series. ""The Marines is a place to find your authentic self,"" he says. ""But I wasn't allowed to be my authentic self, and I couldn't continue being inauthentic with people that I admired and respected so much.""

a39dd14a022d,Eight of the UK's cosiest thatched cottages,,"Alamy (Credit: Alamy) Blackhouse thatched cottage in the Hebrides, Scotland Many thatched cottages in the Hebrides are simple, single-storey structures called blackhouses or taigh-dubh (their name in Gaelic). The term blackhouse probably derives from the fact that these cottages originally had no windows. This type of cottage has 3ft-to-6ft (1m-to-2m) stone walls to help it withstand severe Atlantic storms. Wood here is in short supply and only used for roof timbers. The buildings' rooves normally have a turf base covered with thatch. These layers are traditionally stripped off in June and used as manure to cover local crops. Peter Landers Photography (Credit: Peter Landers Photography) Thatched building at Abigail Hopkins and Amir Sanei's home in Suffolk Architects Hopkins and Sanei designed their contemporary family home, Housestead, as a set of separate structures, each serving an individual function. The living room, housed in one, has a clean-lined thatched roof and boasts bubblegum-pink steel columns, adding a bold, playful touch. The building that houses their living room ""captures the spirit of cosy culture as I see it"", says Hopkins. ""I think cosy culture resonates so widely because it speaks to a universal need for warmth, comfort and togetherness in contrast to the uncertainties of the world today. Whether found in Wales, Scotland or Norway, where it's called koselig , this tradition captures the same instinct to create protective yet inviting spaces that celebrate simple pleasures. ""In an increasingly fast-paced, digital world, this idea of sanctuary and shared experience feels rooted and enduring. Our living area is a warm, light-filled place that feels both sheltered and open, allowing you to watch winter rain lash against the glass while you remain cocooned in comfort yet immersed in nature."" Gilbert McCarragher (Credit: Gilbert McCarragher) Oxfordshire thatched house by Richard Parr Associates This is another example of a contemporary treatment of a thatched home. Made using materials such as English oak, stone and thatch, it was designed to complement its rural setting. British thatched roofs often have very ornate ridges but, in this case, Parr has designed one with sharp, modern lines. He sees thatching as malleable and flexible, and likens it to hair that can be cut in any number of styles. ""In our buildings we use thatch as a contemporary roofing solution,"" he says. ""While we might face planning restrictions, we're using this material in exciting ways that also go beyond superficial aesthetics. So far we have received no resistance from planning authorities. There is a freedom to innovate with the material."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

9e0388be817b,The turbulent history of the union jack,,"Stewart continues: ""This was another means of smoothing national sensibilities by ensuring that the precedence given to the Irish saltire – because it lay over the Scottish saltire – was balanced by the Scottish saltire having precedence in the more prestigious half of the design."" The flag was first flown on 1 January 1801, when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into being. Since the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the red has represented Northern Ireland. Alamy The Death of Major Peirson by John Singleton Copley (1783) portrays a moment of British victory against a French invasion of Jersey (Credit: Alamy) Why no Wales, the other nation that makes up Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland)? Because in 1283 Edward I conquered the rebellious Welsh. To underline his supremacy, Edward made his son the Prince of Wales. As a principality, rather than a kingdom, Wales is regarded as being represented by the cross of St George. It was declared in Parliament in 1908 that ""the union jack should be regarded as the national flag"". Along with the United States' stars and stripes, the union jack is arguably the most recognised flag in the world. ""I think in terms of longevity, influence and representation in different spheres, the union jack is absolutely iconic,"" Nick Groom says. He points out that the flag is easily recognisable from just a small portion of it, or when rendered in different colours or in black and white. A symbol of Empire Although originally a royal flag, the Union flag gradually became the symbol of Britain and then the UK. And as Britain grew as a colonial power and its empire spread, the union jack, which at one time flew over roughly a quarter of the world's population and landmass, became synonymous with subjugation and exploitation for those peoples of imperial territories who wanted independence. For many, the flag still carries connotations of colonialism as well as unsettling associations with Britian's role in the transatlantic slave trade .",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251007-the-turbulent-history-of-the-union-jack-flag,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m77kz4.jpg,2025-10-08T11:00:00+00:00,62fc1340bd8561d48d8a75a0f2b833b7f7acc8f7
87f8bfa3bd38,'Lee Miller was the bravest person I ever knew': The pioneering photographer who captured the horror of World War Two,,"Miller's headstrong creativity is evoked by her wry quotes; she once explained of her work: ""It was a matter of getting out on a damn limb, and sawing it off behind you."" The urgency, audaciousness, and unexpected compassion that defines so much of her photography is also inextricably linked to her personal experience. She was born in 1907 in Poughkeepsie, New York State; she began her global adventures in her youth, though her ultimate home was Farleys House in the East Sussex countryside, where she moved in 1949 with her husband, British painter and curator Roland Penrose, and their infant son Antony. It was only following Miller's death in 1977 that her family discovered a huge cache of her previously unseen negatives, personal letters and manuscripts. Traumatic details This proved a multi-stranded revelation. It uncovered traumatic details that Miller had never openly discussed – the childhood sexual abuse she had suffered (aged seven, she was abused by a family acquaintance) and the full extent of the World War Two horrors she had witnessed. For Antony Penrose, it also brought focus to his mother's undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, and their icy relationship, which only thawed shortly before her death. Penrose became his mother's biographer (his book, The Lives Of Lee Miller, inspired the recent biopic); he and his daughter Ami Bouhassane are now custodians of Miller's archives and also guides at Farleys House, where visitors can see artworks by Miller and her life-long friends (such as Man Ray and Picasso), contemporary art exhibitions, and some of Miller's personal effects – including the bespoke knuckledusters she carried during the war.

5cc176f9aa18,Riders to Tackle!: Why Britain loved Jilly Cooper's raunchy books,,"Getty Images Cooper's books have been bestsellers since the 1980s (Credit: Getty Images) Daisy Buchanan , author of books including Insatiable and Limelight, host of the You're Booked podcast and Jilly Cooper superfan, first discovered the writer as a teenager. ""I think I was about 13 when I fell in love with Jilly's books,"" she tells BBC Culture. ""Riders and Rivals were being passed around at school, almost 20 years after they were first published, which is a testament to her power. Her stories are dramatic, extravagant, escapist tales – but while she sets her books in glamorous worlds, her characters are so vulnerable, loveable and human. It's only in Jilly-land where you get heroines who triumph while feeling self-conscious about their spots."" As it had for millions of readers before her, the sex left a lasting impression, too. ""She was the first writer I read who talked openly about women seeking pleasure,"" says Buchanan. ""She's not the first writer to write about sex, but I think she's one of the first to show sex on the page that is tender, joyful and loving – and to say that you don't need to be perfect to seek those sexual experiences. In her stories, sex is sometimes Earth-shatteringly profound, and sometimes simply fun."" Escapist and educational? This positive attitude to sex was a huge influence when Buchanan started writing her own novels. ""My first novel, Insatiable, wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Jilly Cooper's novels,"" she says. ""Jilly's books formed my emotional sex education, and Insatiable… owes an enormous debt to Rivals and Riders. I wanted to write escapist sex with real emotions."" But while there is much to celebrate in Cooper's portrayals of sex, it wasn't always fun – or consensual. ""There are rapes that happen in Jilly's books, and it is very rare that the rapist has any kind of comeuppance,"" says Burge. In one particularly disturbing scene in Riders, Rupert coerces his wife Helen into a sexual act. ""It's a really horrible scene,"" says Burge. ""Those aspects are difficult to read now.""",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20231109-riders-to-tackle-the-raunchy-books-britain-loves,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0grs2jt.jpg,2025-10-06T13:15:00+00:00,81fd2a51a79513712c3811b24dd18ff2d60609f0
69028c2b899e,'You cannot kill a legend with science': The century-long search for the Loch Ness Monster,,"The most famous image appeared in 1934 at the height of Nessie-mania: a slender, serpent-like neck rising from the loch. For decades, the photo baffled Nessieologists. In 1979, Californian naturalist Dennis Power suggested the ""monster"" it depicted was an elephant swimming with its trunk above water. Elephants, he noted, could swim up to 30 miles. While admitting the idea of an elephant in the Scottish Highlands was almost as unlikely as a real monster, he said: ""We'd love to apply for a government grant for four round-trip tickets to Scotland and 40 tonnes of peanuts to try and trap it, but that's probably out of the question."" While the photo was later exposed as a hoax , the unlikely elephant theory was not forgotten. In 2006, Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at Glasgow University's Hunterian Museum, suggested that 1930s sightings could have been circus elephants, as fairs visiting nearby Inverness often stopped at Loch Ness to rest animals. ""When their elephants swam in the loch, only the trunk and two humps could be seen – the first hump being the head, the second the back,"" he said. Clark admitted that most sightings of Nessie could be explained by floating logs or waves. However, asked whether he believed in the Loch Ness Monster, Clark said: ""I do believe there is something alive in Loch Ness."" Operation Deepscan may have failed at great expense to capture Nessie, but one less scientific attempt in 1976 achieved similar results at a fraction of the cost. American trombone player Bob Samborski tried to coax Nessie with a mating call on his instrument. He told BBC Radio Highland that if she did emerge, one of two things would happen: ""Either I'll become rich and famous, or if she likes it so much that she eats me alive, at least I'll be famous and somebody else will become rich."" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter , while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251002-the-century-long-search-for-the-loch-ness-monster,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m6dm1y.jpg,2025-10-06T09:58:34.662000+00:00,bd9c3f4436335653bd005e2052c72529ce27b34f
a31980a0c28e,'A force for alienation': How The Social Network predicted the future of tech,,"Zuckerberg may have a point, but it's hardly the first time that a film has twisted the truth for dramatic and thematic purposes. ""As a historian and someone who believes very strongly in media literacy, I always approach and encourage others to approach a film based on real events as still a dramatisation,"" Jason Steinhauer, the author of History, Disrupted: How Social Media and the World Wide Web Have Changed the Past, tells the BBC. ""Every Hollywood film takes liberties, removes elements from the story, heightens the drama, and accentuates certain characters, all in the name of storytelling. I would be hesitant for anyone to make an assumption that the Zuckerberg that was depicted in that film is somehow this very accurate picture of the man himself."" What is striking, though, is the way The Social Network draws a different type of ""accurate picture"" – a picture of certain negative aspects of social media which wouldn't be analysed in depth for years after the film came out. According to its critics, online interaction feeds on insecurity; it can encourage hostility; and it has, as the New York Times put it last year, ""created a recipe for loneliness"". The shots of Zuckerberg sitting motionless in his chair, repeatedly tapping the button to see if Albright has responded, encapsulate social media In 2020, CNBC reported on a Cigna survey that ""found an increasing correlation between social media usage and feelings of loneliness"". And in the words of a 2021 Oxford University philosophy study by Emily Qureshi-Hurst – just one of many recent articles on the subject – ""social media heightens feelings of alienation and estrangement"" in three ways: ""1) social media allows us to construct artificial versions of ourselves through the use of filters and photo editing software; 2) it provides the means to quantify social approval in groups the size of which the human brain has not evolved for; 3) it extends the size of our social networks but decreases the quality of interactions."" In short, it turns us all into callow students, desperate to be popular, however badly that desperation makes us feel. The final scene of The Social Network sums up this state. After betraying his best friend Eduardo and getting his new best friend Sean ousted from Facebook, Zuckerberg sits alone in an office, waiting for Albright to accept his Facebook friend request. The shots of him sitting motionless in his chair, repeatedly tapping the button to see if Albright has responded, are the perfect encapsulation of what social media has done to so many of us. ""Followers and likes are the new economy,"" says Archer. ""It's an economy based on a false idea of connectivity, because you're not connected to those people.""",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251003-how-the-social-network-predicted-the-future-of-tech,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m6lclg.jpg,2025-10-04T16:00:00+00:00,bb0c0eba8fb16febab5b25b8edacacdd577202ef
5e6dffcdbe55,"'His intense, unblinking stare is perfect': The dog-centred horror led by a new canine acting 'superstar'",,"""The idea started as a concept after watching Poltergeist [1982] for probably the 100th time,"" Leonberg tells BBC Culture. ""In the opening of that film, the family's dog clearly senses the presence of the ghost before anyone else. That trope of 'the dog who knows better' appears in so many horror films, and I thought, 'Someone should really tell that story from the dog's perspective.'"" Leonberg didn't have to search far to cast the lead, as Indy is his own dog, who he thought could be perfect due to his ""intense, unblinking stare"". Through expressive head tilts, whimpers and inquisitive stares, Indy certainly takes the audience along with him on the terrifying experience of the discovery of some sort of supernatural force. And, as the human faces in the film are mostly obscured, the viewer also experiences the frustration of a loyal animal trying to warn his owner of trouble, only to be – sometimes cruelly – dismissed. This unusual perspective makes the film surprisingly affecting. Over the course of three years, Leonberg and his wife, Kari Fischer – also a producer on the movie – filmed Indy in a huge variety of situations and scenarios. ""It came down to having the camera ready at the right time in the right place,"" he explains, ""then guiding him with simple cues, noises, gestures, and food into those circumstances, and being ready to capture his instincts rather than impose our expectations on him. ""These [moments] could be edited together to create an illusion of a performance,"" he says. ""On camera, if you cut from his gaze to what he's looking at, the audience instinctively creates the meaning. We often connect the dots when watching horror films and Indy was naturally suited to help the audience do that.""

Last year's A Complete Unknown concentrated on the earliest years of Bob Dylan's career, and now Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere dramatises an even shorter chapter of its subject's life story. As played by Jeremy Allen White ( The Bear ), Bruce Springsteen is shown making just one album, 1982's Nebraska. He is on the verge of superstardom, but he is also having a crisis of confidence. His solution: to retreat to his bedroom in New Jersey with a four-track recorder and an acoustic guitar, to work on a set of songs about blue-collar disappointment. Jeremy Strong (Succession) co-stars as Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, while Stephen Graham (Adolescence) plays his hard-drinking father in the black-and-white flashbacks to his 1950s childhood. ""If some fans go in expecting the equivalent of a greatest hits package, think again,"" writes Pete Hammond in Deadline . ""Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere is the real deal, an intelligent, deliberately paced journey into the soul of an artist."" Released internationally on 24 October Amazon MGM Studios Hedda Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler was first staged in 1891, but Nia DaCosta ( Candyman , The Marvels) has updated the classic play in more ways than one. The writer-director has moved the action to an English mansion in 1954, where the newly married anti-heroine is throwing a long, lavish and increasingly chaotic party. Two other key changes to the text are that the title character (played by Tessa Thompson) is now a black woman in a predominantly white environment, and her ex-lover is now a woman (Nina Hoss). The most crucial update, though, is that DaCosta has made her adaptation an intensely stylish and sensuous affair, as embodied by its leading lady. It's a ""devilish thrill"" to watch the ""sultry"" Thompson in a film ""full of attitude, energy, and colour"", writes Kristy Puchko in IndieWire . ""Sumptuous, hot, and challenging, this is a drama of love, sex, and regret that burns like a shot of whisky.""

a456e415d7fe,'You can't grasp her or replicate her': Why Anna Magnani is the overlooked 'goddess' of Italian cinema,,"Less than a year earlier, Teresa Gullace, a six-month-pregnant mother of five had been shot in Rome by a Nazi soldier after she waved at her captive husband. In the film, Francesco shouts ""Teresa"", as an homage. At the time, Magnani was also suffering, as her son had contracted polio. An unconventional star Magnani's communication of this raw pain on screen is perhaps one reason why she is less popular in the US today than other iconic Italian actresses. ""Anna is the embodiment of a country that came out of the war with the courage of showing its wounds,"" says De Bernardinis. ""Soon after, Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida and other 'maggiorate' ('busty actresses') represent the Italy that wants to forget the war. Florid, full bodied, flourishing."" Rome, Open City became the highest grossing film in Italy that year, and the first non-American film to earn over $1m in the US. The American press loved it. Magnani, The New York Times wrote, had ""an ability to weep real tears, to laugh real laughter, to brawl fiercely; to be thunderous in anger, lusciously sensual in love"". Tennessee Williams tried to convince Magnani to act in his new play on Broadway – one of the many American offers she refused. ""This woman, Anna Magnani, she sinks the claws in the heart,"" he said. The fact itself that she existed, despite the photogenic standards of the time, despite a tormented biography, is important for a girl who chooses to do my job – Liliana Fiorelli Ingrid Bergman liked Rome, Open City so much that she wrote to Rossellini – adding that the only Italian words she knew were ""Ti amo"". Rossellini, Magnani's partner, kept the exchange secret, until she saw a telegram from Bergman. She lovingly plated some spaghetti, asking Rossellini if he would like some. When he replied yes, she answered: ""Then eat it!"" and threw it all at his face. This episode is recalled by friends and bystanders; the only detail that changes with the telling of the story is what pasta they were eating. In short, Magnani was intimidating. ""Not cute, nor reassuring,"" says De Bernardinis.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250929-why-anna-magnani-is-the-overlooked-goddess-of-italian-cinema,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m635h2.jpg,2025-10-01T11:00:00+00:00,f352b38fdb22f07e969dd358dd877fedc84722dd

2abd987a416c,Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2,,"Swinney says 'precedent is on my side' to secure indyref2 James Delaney BBC Scotland First Minister John Swinney told BBC's The Sunday Show that ""precedent is on my side"" when it comes to indyref2 John Swinney said the precedent set ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum should trigger a new poll, if the party wins a majority at the next Holyrood election. The SNP gained more than half of MSPs in 2011, an electoral triumph that paved the way for a vote on the country's future. On Saturday delegates at the party's conference in Aberdeen backed his strategy ahead of a bid to make the next election a de-facto poll on independence. But Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said the UK Labour government, which would have to approve the move, does not support a second referendum. Sir Keir Starmer previously said he had no plans to allow a fresh poll to take place during his term as prime minister. But Swinney told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that the prime minister's position was ""fatuous"" due to the ""clearly established basis"" set out after the SNP's historic win 14 years ago. He added: ""Precedent is on my side. ""This is what happened in 2011. ""And precedent is a substantial factor in legal consideration of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future."" The SNP leader said that result meant his party was in a ""much stronger position"" to negotiate a mandate for a new vote should they achieve a majority next year. Asked if the election should instead be fought on current issues, such as standards of living, Swinney replied: ""I would say to people worried about their standard of living, this election should be about independence. ""Because, under the United Kingdom, people's standard of living has been flat as a pancake for 15 years."" The first minister said Scotland had to consider if was going to accept ""more of this"" as well as what he described as a ""shift to the right"" in UK politics. He said the SNP was bringing down NHS waiting lists and building more affordable homes. Swinney added: ""Self-government works for the people of Scotland and if we want to improve living standards, let's have the choice of independence."" PA Media Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed copies of her memoir at the conference Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed Swinney's strategy as she signed copies of her new memoir at the conference. Sturgeon, who will step down as an MSP next year, said achieving a majority was an ""exceptionally hard task"". But she added: ""If you don't set your sights high, you don't deliver big things."" In the 2011 election , the SNP – then led by the late Alex Salmond – won 69 of 129 available seats. The party has failed to gain an outright majority in two Holyrood elections since then. Salmond and the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron signed the Edinburgh Agreement in October 2012. It set out the terms for the 2014 ballot under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. Scotland voted against leaving the UK by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7% in September 2014. Any new vote would require Starmer to grant similar assent. Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander told The Sunday Show that he had ""heard all of this before” from Swinney regarding indyref2 Also appearing on the Sunday Show, Alexander said Swinney was using independence to divert attention away from the SNP's ""horrific"" record on public services. He said he was not sure if he had been listening to ""the Grand Old Duke of York or the first minister of Scotland"". Alexander added: ""This is all about marching his troops in that hall up to the top of the hill and then back down again. ""We have heard all of this before."" Asked if the UK government would say no to a second independence referendum, the Labour MP for Lothian East said he was ""working for victory"" at the Holyrood election in 2026 and ""not anticipating defeat"". Alexander told The Sunday Show: ""I am not going to divulge in his game which is to divert attention from his horrifically bad record on Scotland's public services by trying instead to provoke an argument about the constitution."" The Scottish Secretary, who replaced Ian Murray last month , was also questioned about whether he had a ""duty to the electorate"" to outline what would happen in the event of an SNP majority. He replied: ""I was elected on a very clear manifesto in July of 2024 which said Labour does not support independence or another referendum. ""That's the mandate on which I was elected and I will adhere to that mandate."" John Swinney has hinted that he has some tactics in mind to force the issue of a referendum, should the SNP win big next year. He might have given one of them away by talking about the legal importance of precedent. One speaker at the conference yesterday raised the prospect of a judicial review - should UK ministers reject calls for a vote - and was then name-checked by Swinney on stage. Could fresh court action be on the first minister's mind? The example of 2011 may provide a political precedent - but is there a legal one? After all, the Supreme Court has already issued a ruling that UK ministers must consent to a binding referendum. We are of course getting way ahead of the game. There is still an election to be fought, and a Holyrood majority is a hard thing to secure. But some in the SNP are already thinking even further ahead. Indeed it has been suggested that Sir Keir Starmer's refusal might be moot as, if results go against him in Scotland and Wales, then he may well be out on his ear and they'll be negotiating with someone else. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton accused the first minister of ""desperately pushing his obsession with independence"" to divert attention from ""the SNP's failures in government"". She added: ""Swinney, as usual, is putting party before country, by fixating on breaking up the UK, rather than fixing the damage done to our NHS, schools, jobs and economic growth by his government."" Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said the first minister was using the ""crutch of independence"" in a bid to to restore the party's fortunes. He said: ""John Swinney and the SNP need to talk about independence as a distraction because they have failed to deliver after almost two decades in charge. ""People will see through the strategy as they want change from the same old stuff.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg424dk03x9o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1bbb/live/419bcf60-a75e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T12:19:52.415000+00:00,77e54c0daead580837456fdf673f55f05227ecd7
b9d815fa1769,I was shocked when mum told me what she wants to do with her body when she dies,,"I was shocked when mum told me what she wants to do with her body when she dies Lucy Owen Reporter, Inside The World of Body Donors Lucy Owen Mum and I are super close, so when she told me she wanted to donate her body to education I wanted to know more about why Talking about death with your parents is a conversation everyone dreads, but my mum Patsy wanted that chat with me – and learning what she wants to happen to her body after she's gone came as a shock. Even in the darkest hours when she had bowel cancer a few years ago, I tried to avoid thinking about what it would mean to actually lose mum. But, at 86, she sat me down to tell me she wants to donate her body to medical science after she dies. Mum is certain she wants to be one of the 1,300 UK people every year whose bodies are donated to education as she feels without donors, the doctors of tomorrow won't get the experience they need. When mum told me she'd been already in touch with a university and everything was arranged, I was torn between admiration and confusion. If I'm honest, body donation just wasn't on my radar and I had loads of questions running around in my head. How would her body be used? Would we be able to have a funeral? But Patsy Cohen is nothing if not determined and pragmatic. ""I imagine a great big saw will come out and they'll chop off a leg, but I don't really mind,"" she told me in her own inimitable way. Here's a picture of my son Gabs, mum and me and I can tell you mum is still living life to the full, whether it's walking the dog or playing bridge and have a glass of wine with friends Mum wants to donate her body to show her gratitude to medical professionals as they helped her when she had bowel cancer and needed surgery four years ago. She wants to help the medics of the future and told me: ""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, so this is a simple way to give back."" As a journalist and inquisitive daughter, I naturally wanted to find out for myself more about what mum was planning to do. So I made a documentary at a university that teaches using real human bodies - and the one where mum will go. Our cameras were given rare access behind the scenes at Cardiff University to see what happens to our donated bodies. We saw how students ""developed a connection"" with their donors and their relationship with the families left behind. The anatomy centre is where medical students learn from real bodies rather than from textbooks in lecture theatres. ""There really is no substitute for being able to see, touch and feel real anatomy,"" said Dr Hannah Shaw, who leads the anatomy education team. King Charles is among the people I have met in my 18 years working as a BBC journalist in Cardiff, presenting the evening news programme Wales Today Just as our bodies are different on the outside, she said physiology and conditions such as cancer or hip replacements make us different on the inside, too. ""Textbooks give you the impression that everything is the same and we're not,"" she added. However, the use of real bodies in anatomy education is falling as advances in technology mean human bodies can be replicated in 3D on screens. Angela Gillson Freya (pictured here with her parents) is among the hundreds of medical students who joined Cardiff University last year But Dr Shaw feels the real thing provides the best education for students like Freya Gillson. ""Things in real life look completely different to how you think they would look,"" said the 19-year-old Cardiff University medical student. ""So working with donors is incredible. They are our very first patients and you do develop a connection with them - they're our silent teachers."" When someone who has pledged their body to Cardiff University dies, they are brought to the anatomy centre as quickly as possible. The bodies are preserved and, if donors consented, some parts are removed and retained for further teaching. Donors can remain in the centre for up to three years. When the time comes for the bodies to leave the anatomy centre, the university places them into coffins for a funeral director to collect. Their families then get to decide if they want to cremate or bury them, with the funeral costs covered by the university. Carol Endersby Joy Sesay (centre) was 95 when she died in a care home near London in 2024 but she wanted her body donated to Cardiff University as she'd lived in the Welsh capital for 30 years So it can be a long wait for families as they grieve their loved ones, something the family of Joy Sesay had to adjust to. ""Her whole ethos was about helping people who were less fortunate than yourself - and being a good person,"" daughter Jenny told me. With eight children, 20 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren, Joy left behind a very large family who held memorial services while waiting for the cremation. Although some felt they'd had closure, granddaughter AJ admitted feeling ""in limbo"" without a funeral. ""It's kind of been a bit strange because it hasn't been your usual, go to the funeral and then you deal with it,"" she said. Inquiry rates from people wanting to donate have been lower in the UK in recent years and Cardiff has seen a fall, with about 50% fewer people registering since 2020. Although 154 people still signed up in 2024. Not everyone can donate their body to science and for those that do consider it, universities ""strongly recommend"" they should tell their families. Some 1,200 students and 800 professionals, including dentists, midwives and surgeons, learn on body donors every year at Cardiff At the end of the academic year, I went to the annual memorial event held by the university where families and students meet each other. The students don't say who they've worked with but it's a chance for them to share what they've learned more generally. ""Seeing the pictures of our donors with their families, it made it all very real,"" Freya said about that ""poignant moment"". ""Everybody takes a step back and realises that this journey's come to an end."" For Joy's family, it's just the beginning. ""You think it might be a one-off gift of your body and you close the book, that's not the case,"" daughter Carol said. ""The fact is you open the book and the good that her body will do, not just for future doctors, but for future patients... we just didn't realise the enormity and importance of what she did."" Patsy Cohen The image on the left is mum in her work uniform as an air hostess for BOAC while on the right she's with my dad Jeff at a party in the 1960s It'll be an unimaginable wrench when we do have to say that last goodbye to mum, but I'm so glad I know and understand her wishes. In typical Patsy style she told me: ""I feel when I'm not here, I'm not going to be wasted, it's going to do some good and help make a better doctor."" It will give me real comfort to know that she is continuing to make a difference and that makes me enormously proud of her. Hopefully it'll be many years before I hand mum over to the care of Cardiff University's anatomy centre - and I'm delighted to report that Patsy is not going gently and is still living life to the full. This journey has also led me to the decision to donate my body to the centre when I die, too.

West Yorkshire Police said two men aged 25 and 43 had been arrested on suspicion of murder. The disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offences. Watkins, 48, was jailed in December 2013 for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Police said they were called to the prison on Saturday morning to reports of a serious assault on a prisoner, who was pronounced dead at the scene. A Prison Service spokesperson said it was aware of an incident at the prison but was ""unable to comment further while the police investigate"". Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison with a further six years on licence, and his two co-defendants, the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years. He was previously attacked in prison in August 2023 , but his injuries were not life threatening. The attack at Wakefield Prison comes less than two weeks after a report into the facility was published that found violence there had ""increased markedly"". The report from the chief inspector of prisons said: ""Many prisoners told us they felt unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offences who increasingly shared the prison with a growing cohort of younger prisoners."" Police were called to Wakefield Prison on Saturday morning Watkins admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape. He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. Judges rejected an appeal by Watkins in 2014 to reduce the length of his jail term. During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke ""new ground"" and ""plunged into new depths of depravity"". ""Any decent person... will experience shock, revulsion and incredulity."" The judge said Watkins had a ""corrupting influence"", and had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"". Who was Ian Watkins? Getty Images Watkins performing in London a few months before his arrest in 2012 His trial heard Watkins had used his fame to manipulate and control others, often under the influence of hard drugs, including crystal meth. After Watkins was sentenced, Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: ""Watkins used his status and global fame as a means to manipulate people and sexually abuse children.

A 52-year-old man from Kettering, a 42-year-old man from Wellingborough, a 42-year-old woman from Kettering and a 42-year-old woman of no fixed abode, have also been arrested on suspicion of murder and burglary. Northamptonshire Police previously arrested a 38-year-old woman from Thrapston on suspicion of murder before releasing her on bail. Complex investigation Det Ch Supt Rich Tompkins, of Northamptonshire Police, described the investigation as complex. ""We have a very large number of officers and detectives working around the clock on this case exploring all evidential opportunities including CCTV and doorbell footage and forensics,"" he said. ""We have arrested four more suspects and they are in police custody. We want to reassure people that we do not believe there is a wider threat to the public in terms of this investigation."" Six days prior to his death, on 2 October, Mr Morgan had reported being the victim of an assault to Northamptonshire Police. Given he was in contact with the police in the days before his death, the force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

The Oscar nominee, who stars as Elphaba in the hit film, took on a new role as Strictly's first ever guest mentor, leaving some of the celebrities starstruck. ""She's a true goddess,"" said model and actor Ellie Goldstein, after Erivo praised her energy during the dance show's annual movie-themed week. And after she had showered Amber Davies with praise, the former Love Islander said it was the ""best day of her life"". ""She is everything I want to be,"" Davies added, after Erivo told her she felt like a ""proud parent"" watching her dance. BBC/Guy Levy Amber Davies and her dance partner Nikita Kuzmin wowed with their American Smooth It marks a return to the show for Erivo, who was a guest judge for two weeks in 2021, and it sparked a big reaction on social media. ""I loved how much she boosted the confidence of every contestant,"" wrote one X user , while another said she would have ""cried tears"" if Erivo had told her she ""was fab"". Erivo wasn't the only nod to Wicked during Saturday night's show. The opening dance routine for movie week was inspired by the film's forthcoming sequel, Wicked: For Good, which hits cinemas next month. The female professional dancers wore black dresses like the film's Wicked Witch of the West, while the men channelled their inner Prince Fiyero. Set against a green and blue backdrop, the number was theatrical, dramatic and… a bit spooky. Elsewhere, it was a truly cinematic evening as the Strictly contestants embodied their characters for movie week. The highest score of the night went to Emmerdale star Lewis Cope, who bagged the first 10 of the series. Cope and his professional dance partner Katya Jones took on the classic film The Mask of Zorro for their routine, as they did the Paso Doble to the song The Plaza of Execution. In total, they netted 37 points from the judges, with head judge Shirley Ballas calling their routine ""extraordinary"". BBC/Guy Levy Ellie is Barbie. Vito is just Ken We also saw Goldstein live out her Barbie dreams, as she did daring dips, squats and swirls in a silver sequin jumpsuit, while Davies and Olympian Harry Aikines-Aryeetey also impressed. TikToker George Clarke scored 31 for his K-Pop Demon Hunters-inspired couple's choice dance. And performer La Voix left the audience and judges in a stunned silence, after a magical waltz in which she became the Bird Woman from the musical Mary Poppins.

In a statement, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany said the joint action would ""increase pressure"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""bring Russia to the negotiation table"". It added the move would be taken ""in close cooperation"" with the US. UK sanctions have frozen more than £25bn of Russian assets since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But until now, funds sent to Ukraine using Russian assets had only been taken from profits and interest accrued on them. Sir Keir told Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky that the UK, France and Germany were ""united in wanting to drive progress towards using the full value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to end the war"". He added that more sanctions ""in the coming days and weeks"" would add further pressure on Moscow. The announcement comes after European leaders met in Copenhagen last week to discuss using frozen Russian assets for a €140bn ($162bn; £121bn) loan to Ukraine. Last month, US President Donald Trump called on G7 allies to seize ""or otherwise use"" frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times. The value of frozen Russian assets in the EU is estimated to be almost €211bn (£181bn). President Zelensky urges UK's Sir Keir Starmer to join 'Purl' programme Russia launched extensive missile and drone strikes across Ukraine on Friday, causing power cuts in large parts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and eight other regions. Two people were killed and at least 20 people were injured in the attack, Ukrainian officials said. In a post on X following the attack, Zelensky wrote that the ""cynical and calculated attack"" targeted civilian and energy infrastructure. ""What's needed is not empty words but decisive action - from the United States, Europe and the G7 - in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,"" he wrote. ""Every sanction decision weakens Russia's war machine,"" Zelensky wrote, in a separate post. Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge Sir Keir to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine. While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv, he said it should send a clear signal that it would take part in the system, as well as impose more sanctions on Russia.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62np269qv9o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c3e3/live/e61646b0-a641-11f0-bf8c-8df5a7a0d5c3.jpg,2025-10-11T03:02:51.761000+00:00,7e661cf78196b98057c31c63ccb1d0a0891be306

1b20b7b034ab,"Cold, flu, Covid: Why is everyone sick right now?",,"Cold, flu, Covid: Why is everyone sick right now? Nick Triggle Health correspondent iStock/Getty Images Are you ill? If not, you probably know someone who is - or at the very least someone who has just recovered. Coughs and colds, it seems, are rampant at the moment. And, if the anecdotes of people I know are anything to go by, the bug going round seems to be a particularly nasty one. Sore throat? Tick. Streaming nose? Tick. Sinus pressure? Double tick. What's going on? The perfect breeding ground ""This is normal, it's autumn after all,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, from Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He says a combination of children returning to school, adults back at work after the summer break and people spending more time indoors as the weather turns cooler creates a ripe breeding ground for respiratory viruses to flourish. ""Basically we have a big mixing pot of different viruses that are beginning to do the rounds. Immunity has waned and people are getting ill."" There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. Is there more illness than normal? Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment. Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection. There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn. ""There is often, although not always, a pattern,"" says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. ""You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV,"" he explains. ""Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."" He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high. ""Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."" Is it a cold, flu or Covid? The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are: Colds Symptoms appear gradually Mostly affect nose and throat Early sign - pressure in your ears Chestier, mucus cough Flu Comes on suddenly Feel wiped out Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion Need bed rest Dry cough Covid Typical flu symptoms Loss of taste of smell Diarrhoea or tummy upset Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap. How can you protect yourself? Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu. But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. ""We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why,"" admits Prof Ball. ""Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."" In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for flu, Covid and RSV to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions. If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places. Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing. ""Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult. ""By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz608l9l4o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg,2025-10-11T23:07:17.027000+00:00,c20dcff6a2ef0bf3a1bd7d05ceaefab806d6397f
294c5bcd12a6,Why Labour's deputy leadership race could be a verdict on Starmer,,"Why Labour's deputy leadership race could be a verdict on Starmer Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg BBC Of the 18 politicians to have been Labour's deputy leader, one has a dim view of the job. ""Really ghastly,"" says Dame Margaret Beckett, who was number two under John Smith in the 1990s. She reckons it was a thankless task - important, but frankly, a bit dull. Well, it's not boring right now. Labour is in a mess, and the party has to choose a new deputy who might be part of Sir Keir Starmer's salvation or, if it goes wrong, make a bad situation even worse. So what's the job, who wants it, and what might happen next? ""It's a bit of a funny, vague role,"" one party insider says. There isn't a precise job description. Technically, the deputy leader has a seat on Labour's obscure but incredibly powerful National Executive Committee. They attend what's known as political cabinet, not the weekly meeting of ministers, but the less frequent get together of the prime minister's top team where the civil servants are booted out of the room, and the party people come in. The deputy also attends the weekly party parliamentary meeting, along with the prime minister, some elected backbenchers and the leader of the House. The deputy leader is not automatically the deputy prime minister - the official government understudy - and won't be this time. That job was given to David Lammy when he was moved sideways from being foreign secretary. Another source says the deputy is the ""campaigner in chief"" - it's a huge opportunity, but also, with Labour facing a very tricky set of elections in May, it's a tough prospect. Leaders cannot just tell their number two to pipe down, because they are voted in by party members. That quandary is at the root of the contest this time round. Reuters Angela Rayner quit as Labour's deputy leader in September The two candidates, on paper, have a lot in common. Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson are both straight talking politicians from the north of England. Neither are from the strident far left of the Labour movement, nor ardent members of the New Labour fan tribe. Although, as a party source suggests, Powell has played it ""one step to the left of Bridget"" through the last few weeks. They have both held senior positions and are well known in the party. Among the public there's not much in it either. One recent survey by YouGov suggested 31% of people have heard of Phillipson, while 36% said they knew of Powell. Both are far less well known than the woman they seek to replace, Angela Rayner (84%) who resigned after failing to pay enough tax on her £800,000 flat in Hove, East Sussex , breaching the ministerial code. What's the campaign really about, then? Phillipson and Powell's pitches Well the big difference is that Phillipson is in Starmer's cabinet - and Powell was sacked from it a few weeks ago ( she claims Starmer gave her no reason why other than to ""make way"" for someone else). Powell has made clear during the campaign that she will speak her mind when things are going wrong, arguing that the government needs a ""course correction"" to avoid more political mistakes like the handling of winter fuel allowance . Her backers argue the party will be stronger if it is brave enough to open up debate to more people because, frankly, the clique around Starmer - as many within the party see it - has made plenty of mistakes. PA Wire Lucy Powell has been unafraid to speak her mind during the campaign One source said members had found it ""offensive"" to be told by senior figures in the party that ""only someone on the prime minister's good behaviour list"" should be considered for the job. The source said the deputy should be the ""yin to the yang"" of No 10. In this best-case scenario, the deputy has their finger firmly on the pulse of the party - so if ministers decide on a plan that members and MPs are likely to dislike, the deputy can put the brakes on. If their opinion is taken into consideration, that is. Phillipson's team argue a big voice like this outside the cabinet would create a rival power base that could destabilise what is an already shaky political operation. Picture the scene - the government decides it really has to crack on with some welfare cuts after all and ministers announce them. The deputy gives an interview and sounds not entirely convinced. MPs then have licence to protest and complain. Downing Street's plans look wobbly, and with several of the prime minister's big ideas having already been ditched, you know what happens next. Phillipson's pitch is that she would argue for members' desires , particularly to help kids who grow up in poverty, and make that case firmly but quietly on the inside, without becoming a lightning rod for dissent. And then on the outside, her team say she would take on more of the job of persuading the public the government is getting things done. Phillipson will on Sunday promise members more power over decision-making, pledging that rather than just talking to their own MP at constituency meetings, she would formally ask members and unions for their views every three months - whether using a new app or through the existing party website. She's also vowing that ministers would hold direct meetings with party members online, and to change the rules around how the party makes policy. Reuters Bridget Phillipson has made various promises to change the party's apparatus For example, when Ed Miliband was leader, Labour opened up the National Policy Forum (NPF) - the party's official machine for making plans - to outside organisations. Ever since, charities, campaign groups and even big companies such as Primark and Vodafone have been able to submit their ideas to it. I'm told Phillipson is pledging to change the rules so only members or organisations with official links to the party could put forward their ideas to the NPF for official consideration. In practical terms, Labour leaders make the final decisions, but how the party is structured matters a lot too - particularly to members. So who is on course to win? A likely candidate - but room for surprise Shock horror in a political campaign, you'll be amazed that the two women have both been caricatured. Powell is not a wild rebel intent on causing havoc (she was in the cabinet until a few weeks ago), nor is Phillipson an automaton trapped in the limits of agreed government lines (it's not so long ago she was the target of negative briefings herself). You'll be staggered too, not really, to learn there's been a bit of backchat between the two sides: Phillipson's allies accusing Powell of not being willing to take part in TV hustings; Powell's allies saying that's nonsense. Phillipson claiming Powell would be ""divisive""; Powell hitting back on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg last weekend to say that is ""ridiculous"". Getty Images The outcome of the deputy leader contest could prove awkward for Starmer Both have been campaigning across the country, taking part in at least 20 in-person and online events with members. Phillipson has more MPs, and more of the unions on her side. Powell has more constituency party backing, and more from the other affiliated organisations like the Society of Labour Lawyers. The decision for the party is in part whether it wants a politician who will represent members' voices from outside the top echelons of government, or perhaps more discreetly, from the inside. Whoever wins, relationships and personalities will shape what happens. Beyond the official duties, the role of deputy leader has been done in very different ways - by very different characters - in recent history. A steady, loyal hand to help out a busy leader, shaking hands and scoffing sandwiches at party events the prime minister simply doesn't have the time to attend, and doing vital campaign grunt work, as Dame Margaret suggests. Or a pressure valve for a leader that sometimes winds up the rank and file. Think of John Prescott's booming tones that connected with some voters and party members who didn't much like Tony Blair's silken schmooze. Or a deputy who grapples to represent the parliamentary party in bitter opposition to the wilder elements of the leader's tribe. Think of the battles between Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn during the party's most recent civil war. This time round, without radical differences between the two candidates, the contest is a chance for members to give a verdict on the leadership, and vent frustration. The truth is that many members, just like Labour MPs, are disgruntled and disappointed by some of the decisions Starmer and his team have made. Some are dismayed by the party's dismal position in the polls, not even 18 months since an enormous election victory. That's why, as things stand, most Labour sources and the limited polling available put Powell as the favourite to win the job. Even a member of the cabinet said to me earlier this week, ""we all know it's going to be Lucy"". We all know by now that politics has an endless capacity to surprise, and the votes haven't all been cast. Phillipson will join us in the studio tomorrow where she'll argue her case, after Powell appeared last week. But if party members do express their frustration by electing Powell, the optics for Starmer would be awkward. One source suggested: ""For Lucy to get sacked then five weeks later, show to be the party's favourite slam-dunk candidate, feeds into the narrative of Keir's non-Midas touch – oops."" It may not be ""ghastly"", but it does seem a decision that Labour members are ready to take.

Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service Both properties suffered significant damage in the fire Abbie, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), said the family planned to go to Tŷ Hafan, which supports people with life-limiting conditions, for the day. Within an hour of being there, Abbie said they received a call that their house had ""caught fire"" and, she said, ""everything just went blur"". Due to the Llanelli home being council-owned, the family were relocated to a temporary home in Carmarthen, more than 20 miles away, where they are currently living. ""It's basically gutted out,"" Abbie said. Abbie says they had 'quite a large donation' that they are 'still going through' Twins Keira and Sienna, 16, were collecting their GCSE results when they found out about the fire. Kiera described longing for precious items, including those belonging to her little sister, Lyndee. ""I lost a load of stuff of my baby sister. I had a picture frame with her thumb print on it with everyone else's,"" she said. ""Obviously, you can't get that back because of the thumb print."" Aderyn, 10, said she is ""praying"" that her sister's ashes have not been damaged. ""We did have some that were buried, but there was some that was left for jewellery and stuff and they were in the house."" Abbie said the ""shock of everything"" has caused issues with her MS. According to the NHS , MS is a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms include fatigue, muscle cramps and problems with vision. Abbie, who uses a wheelchair, said she is ""basically housebound"" because her wheelchair was in the house during the fire. ""It has a big effect on me, which is obviously having a knock on effect on the family,"" she said. Sienna said she wants to return to Llanelli and that its stressful arranging transport to college. ""It's stressful because we've got to get on a bus to college [in Llanelli] and then either stay at someone's house or find a way to come back, a lift or a bus or something,"" added Keira. Following the fire, Abbie said the response from the community has been ""unbelievable"" and she is ""grateful"" for their help. Aderyn, 10, says she's received 'a few teddies' as donations In a statement, Carmarthenshire council said it had remained in contact and was committed to supporting the family. It added the family were rehoused into suitable temporary accommodation for their needs but it understood the ""challenges"" caused by their relocation. It added that its priority was to ensure the home was restored so the family could move back at the earliest opportunity. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the fire was determined as accidental. It added a full investigation was not possible due to the severity of the fire.

a364ec75b3b4,Foetal alcohol disorder 'wasn't my fault',,"Foetal alcohol disorder 'wasn't my fault' Julie McCullough BBC News NI BBC 29-year-old Maggie May travels around the world to share her story of living with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder When Maggie May McHugh was told she had Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) by her social worker, at the age of 15, everything started to make sense. Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) can happen when alcohol in the mother's blood passes to her baby through the placenta. It is a lifelong condition that can not be reversed. ""Up until that point, I didn't understand why I was not like everyone else. I made mistakes. I couldn't learn the way everyone else did. I'd have meltdowns."" Currently, it is not a recognised disability in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. 'Move away from blame and shame' The Department of Health said currently ""there is no specific treatment for FASD"". ""There are supports in place for children with FASD as with other neurodevelopmental conditions."" While the DOH said diagnosis is frequently underreported ""early diagnosis and support can, however, make a difference, so once the condition has been diagnosed a team of professionals can assess the child's needs"". Ms McHugh said discovering she had FASD was ""a weight lifted"". ""I stopped blaming myself for something that wasn't my fault."" She said living with FASD has been very isolating because it is not a recognised disability which has meant no extra support. Most people, she said, do not know what it is or how it can affect people. ""I have to be reminded to eat all the time,"" she said. ""I have no concept of money or time, so I'm always late for things or super early and I spend money like it's going out of fashion."" But Ms McHugh believes it is important to remove the ""blame and shame"" directed towards mothers and focus on providing support for those living with the disorder. ""I am a huge advocate for not stigmatising or stereotyping birth mums. My biological mother was not given the support she needed to have a clean pregnancy."" 17-year-old Reece said people do not know enough about Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Seventeen-year-old Reece said his adoptive parents have always been ""open and honest"" about him having FASD. He said he especially struggles with mental maths and his memory. ""I can remember things that happened five or six years ago"" he said, but could easily forget what he went up the stairs to get. Reece feels frustrated that ""there is no awareness of FASD in Ireland"" which is something he has been trying to change. He said he likes to focus on the ""positive aspects"" of life and is getting ready to go to college to study cosmetology. ""There's pros and cons to every single thing that's about in life,"" he said. Alison McNamara said a lot of children who have FASD get misdiagnosed with something else Reece's mum, Alison McNamara, runs a support group for children and families affected by FASD in Northern Ireland and recently held, what is believed to be, the first conference on the issue here. ""There's no help or support, which is why I started our little support group,"" she said. ""We need to have FASD as a recognised disability over here so we can have the same resources as autism and ADHD."" She also believes the ""hidden disability"" could be eradicated if the right information was given to people about the dangers of drinking whilst pregnant. Tristan Casson-Rennie said Ireland has the 3rd highest rates of FASD in the world Tristan Casson-Rennie, a father of two adopted children with the condition, agrees that more needs to be done. He set up FASD Ireland four years ago after discovering there was no where in Ireland to get a diagnosis. ""Both the NHS and the HSE don't have any clinicians that are able to diagnose currently and so that means that people have to leave the island, perhaps to go to Great Britain, to the clinic in England."" He said it is easy to recognise some of the conditions that come with FASD ""but if we only support those in isolation then we're not looking at the wider picture"". It is unclear how many people are living with FASD but some studies estimate between two and four per cent of the population in the UK could be affected. Alison McNamara would like to see more resources given to young people like Reece and Ms McHugh who are living with the condition. ""Look at these children today who haven't had the right help and see how they're thriving. They are amazing. Imagine how much more amazing they can be with the right help and support.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyrz44wy1vo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2ad6/live/8dd625e0-a431-11f0-965c-0b9b4b029e9a.jpg,2025-10-11T23:03:56.109000+00:00,ef466a0181f6f875d33ab11367bf1de547110f1c
5ddffbc51114,'Australia break new ground to leave Healy one mountain to climb',,"That it took until Sunday's three-wicket win over India for them to complete their first ODI chase over 300, taking back their record for the highest in the women's 50-over format, is, in truth, a compliment to the bowlers that have worn canary yellow (OK, Australia gold) over the past 50 years. It is hard for their batters to hold a record if never given the chance. Ultimately, the result of Australia conceding 330 was captain Alyssa Healy being given an opportunity to produce her latest masterpiece. Then best known as the 19-year-old niece of renowned former Aussie wicketkeeper Ian, she debuted in 2010 after her nation failed to win either of the 20 or 50-over World Cups held the previous year and has seen it all through 15 trophy-laden years since. A T20 World Cup win came three months after her bow and seven world titles have followed from 10 attempts across formats. The gritty keeper was also there in Derby in 2017 when a semi-final defeat by India briefly halted the run of success. That loss ""drove us to rethink our standards,"" Healy said this week. At the next 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, Healy made 170 against England in the final and was named player of the tournament. She ensured her country would not fall short again. Whether this latest epic knock topped that previous effort can be debated. Some will argue the case for the pressure of a final. Others can counter with the challenge that comes when facing a record target and a raucous India-supporting crowd of 20,000. What is certain is this century was far harder to see coming. The Christchurch carnage in 2022 came as she topped the run-scoring charts, but this knock followed six innings in India since the start of last month in which she had failed to pass 30. ""If you've been watching me in the nets, it's been a frustrating experience because I feel like I've had no rhythm whatsoever,"" said Healy. ""But once you step out on the field, your competitive instincts kick in and you just lock into the contest.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c70800rk405o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e341/live/ae0d2310-a7ae-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-12T21:03:24.659000+00:00,9616d8f18ff7678d523fc73a142c27e0363fe1bb
828aa215bdec,How can Scotland qualify for 2026 World Cup?,,"Scotland and Denmark are both on 10 points. The Danes have a handsome goal difference advantage of six goals, and that is the first deciding factor if teams are level on points - not head-to-head. However, Scotland will be hoping they can get the job done without the need for such messiness. We can probably assume Denmark will beat point-less Belarus at home in November - having thrashed them 6-0 last week - which would move them to 13 points. If Scotland beat an already-out Greece in Athens, they would match that tally, setting up an high-anxiety decider at Hampden. A draw in that one on 18 November would almost certainly favour the Danes, given the goal difference disparity. Should the Scots draw in Athens, victory over Denmark would still be enough to win the group. However, defeat for Scotland in Greece, coupled with a Denmark win over Belarus, would mean an extraordinary victory is required in that final game to give Clarke's side any chance of automatic qualification.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqxzxe7g9j0o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/d804/live/98259d50-a7b0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-12T07:35:07.039000+00:00,93d4949c035f2b5b74786ec8bc5bea9594935f24

Asia and Africa are where all of the latest guaranteed spots will come from, with two from Asia and four more from Africa up for grabs. Ghana booked their spot thanks to a 1-0 win over Comoros with Tottenham's Mohammed Kudus claiming the only goal. Mohamed Salah scored twice on Wednesday as Egypt beat Djibouti 3-0 to seal their place at a fourth World Cup. Algeria joined them on Thursday with Riyad Mahrez scoring in a 3-0 Group G win over bottom side Somalia. While no countries in North and Central America or Europe are guaranteed to qualify this month, it is mathematically possible for some countries to do so. Four European nations could book their place this week - England, Portugal, Switzerland and France. Thomas Tuchel's men will qualify with victory over Latvia on Tuesday, while the other three must rely on other results too. Croatia are all but there, sitting three points above the Czech Republic with a far superior goal difference. Joint-hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States were all granted automatic qualification for the World Cup. Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, South Korea and Uzbekistan have already qualified from Asia. Oceania's one direct qualification spot has been taken by New Zealand. Tunisia and Morocco were the first two African sides to go through, before three more joined them this week. Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia are the South American nations currently guaranteed a place.

0e40ac0ccdb0,Can Scotland rouse themselves for World Cup finale?,,"Over the course of the past two games, there's been an alarming lack of influence from many of Clarke's go-to players. Robertson looked off the pace; John McGinn was out of sorts; McTominay, despite his goal, looked a pale imitation of last season when tearing it up in Italy. Adams was impressive and Ben Gannon-Doak threatened to be. He's still a teenager whose pace and ability to ghost past defenders is second nature to him. What he does after that is the bit he must learn. The thinking game. Decision-making. Gannon-Doak puts himself in good positions but too often wastes his own good work with hurried deliveries that are easily dealt with. He'll get there. He's too talented not to. Clarke said he has a lot to mull over, which he does. He said that when it ""comes to the crunch we'll be ready"". The crunch is next month with a visit to Greece and a home game against Denmark that will conclude the group. Scotland's readiness is now a matter of serious debate. Those games will be extraordinarily anxious. The group table, they say, doesn't lie, but it really does. It's one giant porky pie. Scotland are lucky to be sitting in such a fantastic position. They were fortunate to beat Greece and you could say the same about Belarus on Sunday. They survived and it was a blessing, but unless they find their best stuff in the month ahead then this campaign is going to have a grim ending. Clarke and his players know this better than anybody. If they were impressive on Sunday it was in the way they spoke rather than in the way they played. They didn't shirk it. They know that you don't get to a World Cup on luck alone.

dfe3eadc1b2e,Trump says 'war is over' in Gaza as he flies to Israel for release of hostages,,"Trump says 'war is over' in Gaza as he flies to Israel for release of hostages Alex Boyd and Tom Bateman State department correspondent on Air Force One Reuters US President Donald Trump has said ""the war is over"" as he travels to Israel for the release of hostages from Gaza under the ceasefire deal agreed between Israel and Hamas. Speaking on board Air Force One, he said the ceasefire would hold and a ""Board of Peace"" would quickly be set up for Gaza, which he said looked like a ""demolition site"". He also praised the roles of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, one of the mediators. The deadline for Hamas to release all the hostages it is still holding in Gaza is midday local time (10:00 BST). Later on Monday, Trump will travel to Egypt for an international summit aiming to end the war. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel's military response, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of the 20-point peace plan brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated. Twenty of the Israeli hostages are believed to be alive, and Hamas is also due to hand over the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip. An Israeli government spokesperson said they would be released once the living hostages reach Israeli territory. When asked by the BBC whether he believed the ceasefire would hold, Trump said it would, adding ""everybody is happy, and I think it's going to stay that way"". On his peace skills, he said: ""I'm good at solving wars. I'm good at making peace."" Asked if he would ever visit Gaza, Trump said he would. ""I'd like to put my feet on it, at least."" Trump said he thought Gaza would be a ""miracle"" over the coming decades. He added that the region would soon ""normalise,"" with a planned supervisory body - the Board of Peace - to be established ""very quickly"" to oversee Gaza. On Saturday hundreds of thousands of Israelis attended a rally in Tel Aviv and chanted their gratitude to the US leader. Many details for the later phases of the peace plan could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas. Trump will land in Israel on Monday, where he will address the country's parliament the Knesset. He will then travel to lead a summit in Sharm El-Sheikh alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Egypt's foreign ministry said a ""document ending the war in the Gaza Strip"" was expected to be signed. Leaders from more than 20 countries are expected to attend, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Egypt had invited Iran to the summit, but ""neither President [Masoud] Pezeshkian nor I can engage with counterparts who have attacked the Iranian people and continue to threaten and sanction us"". In a post on X he added: ""Iran welcomes any initiative that ends Israel's genocide in Gaza and ensures the expulsion of occupation forces."" What do people in the West Bank think about the ceasefire deal? Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said that once the hostages were returned, the military would destroy underground tunnels in Gaza built by Hamas. Aid trucks began entering Gaza on Sunday and hundreds more were queuing at the border. Palestinians crowded around the convoys arriving in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Speaking to the BBC earlier on Sunday, Unicef's James Elder said dozens of trucks had entered the Strip but that this fell short of what was needed. The UN estimates that at least 600 aid trucks are needed every day to start addressing Gaza's humanitarian crisis. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) declared a famine in parts of the territory, including Gaza City. Israel, however, rejects the IPC report, and its foreign ministry says the conclusions are ""based on Hamas lies"". Israeli military aid body Cogat says the report ignores the ""extensive humanitarian efforts undertaken in Gaza"". EPA Palestinians take aid supplies from a truck that arrived in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip Palestinians returning to northern Gaza have described scenes of devastation, with many of them finding their homes reduced to rubble. Rescue workers have warned there could be unexploded ordnance and bombs in the area. Amjad Al Shawa, who heads a Palestinian organisation coordinating with aid groups, estimated 300,000 tents were needed to temporarily house 1.5 million displaced Gazans. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources. At least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn409y125v3o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4d4f/live/1c92fe80-a7b5-11f0-b8b2-4f209a50dbe9.jpg,2025-10-13T00:41:23.902000+00:00,d9757bccab6dfaf09405f146f1ab14a2b6934049
3b6952bc0e5c,'We're in limbo': A town in Trump country where shutdown axe looms,,"'We're in limbo': A town in Trump country where shutdown axe looms Ana Faguy in Martinsburg, West Virginia BBC Troy Williams, Marcellus Brothers and Jonathan Giba It's been three months since Jonathan Giba moved into temporary housing for homeless veterans inside a hospital for former members of the US military in West Virginia. He has been waiting for medical and dental consultations, after medications he was previously prescribed left him without teeth and unable to walk. Now, with the government shut down, he is preparing to wait even longer. He calls it ""political bs"". The US Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital where Mr Giba is staying in Martinsburg, West Virginia, is still providing medical care, but the VA stopped other programs that help veterans find jobs and transition from military life. ""The shutdown is a waste of time, and it hurts everyone in the meantime,"" the Army veteran says. Martinsburg is an American town particularly fixed to feel the impacts of the US government shutdown. A city of nearly 20,000 people some 85 miles (136km) outside of Washington DC, federal agencies employ upwards of 3,300 people in the area, between the veterans' hospital, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processing facility and an agricultural assistance office. Another thousand or so federal workers commute to the nation's capital each day from the Amtrak station in Martinsburg's centre. This is Trump country, where 67% voted for the president in 2024 and a fierce independence undergirds something of a make-it-work mindset. Because of the government shutdown, a nearby community event - the Freedom's Run Race Series - changed its route from trails near a federal Civil War battlefield site, but otherwise went on as planned. Harper's Ferry, a national park and nearby tourist draw, has been kept open with state money. But the political bickering in Washington and perceived lack of concern about everyday Americans are not far from people's minds. And they worry about what's coming as the shutdown drags on. On an unseasonably warm Monday nearly six days after the US government shut down, Mr Giba sits underneath the shade of a large tree chain-smoking cigarettes with fellow veterans. One of them, Troy Williams, says politics is hurting average Americans. ""This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue,"" he says, ""this is a why aren't they working on a solution issue."" Air Force veteran Marcellus Brothers is concerned about what's ahead. ""We're in limbo, it's scary."" Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since it ran out on 1 October, and much of the government shut down, placing more than 700,000 people on unpaid leave. Some 200,000 other workers deemed ""essential"" are working without pay as the political standoff drags on. Politicians in Washington have pointed fingers in the direction of the opposing party. On Friday, the White House began laying off thousands of federal employees. In a state already hit by job cuts from the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce, the shutdown threatens even steeper losses, Kelly Allen, the executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy warns. ""We have more federal government employees than coal miners in West Virginia,"" she says. ""Of course those jobs are well paying, come with good benefits and in a state with not a whole lot of good paying jobs those are really important."" Tina Hissam, a small business employee in the area, has seen the impact of government shutdowns on her neighbours first hand. ""It hurts the small businesses, they may cancel services, they may not shop locally,"" she says of federal workers. ""The government shutdown has a huge impact and it's really scary, I just pray that it all goes away."" Already, a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) service centre - which serves the seven surrounding counties - has shut its door. The office - responsible for assisting farmers, ranchers and landowners with tasks like applying for farm loans and disaster assistance - will remain closed until the government reopens. And on Wednesday, the IRS furloughed 34,000 workers, so the service centre in Martinsburg may soon be affected. History has shown that as shutdowns go on, more services are cut or shuttered because of a lack of funding. West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito has so far remained unbowed despite the potential impact on areas she represents like Martinsburg. She has voted with fellow Republicans to provide government funding without healthcare subsidies that Democrats want. Both sides' proposals have repeatedly failed. In a local op-ed, Moore Capito noted West Virginia has the third-highest number of federal employees per capita in the country, but blamed Democrats' intransigence. ""These are our neighbours and friends - people who keep our miners safe, process veterans' benefits, secure our borders, and keep drugs out of our communities. They're now facing uncertainty about their pay checks through no fault of their own."" When the first cheques since the shutdown arrive - or don't - on Friday that impact may finally hit. In previous shutdowns, federal workers who went without pay were given back pay, but it remains unclear if that will be the case this time around. ""The economic loss could have wide-ranging consequences on local communities, businesses and households. It could cause long-term damage to local economies,"" resident Mark Mulligan says. ""West Virginia is a poor state and dependent on federal jobs and handouts. The pain to the elderly, the disabled and to children could be catastrophic.

""After being exposed to such a different world [in Silicon Valley], it's my responsibility to bring that mindset back and combine it with the talent I see in Paraguay."" She is now a partner at global technology and investment firm Cibersons, whose headquarters is in Paraguay's capital Asunción. While most countries would love to build a world-class tech sector, Paraguay has a distinct advantage in one regard – an abundance of cheap, green electricity. This is thanks to 100% of its generation now coming from hydroelectric power. This is centred on the giant Itaipu Dam on the Paraná River, which forms part of the border between Paraguay and Brazil. This huge hydroelectric power station, the largest in the world outside of China, supplies 90% of Paraguay's electricity needs, and 10% of Brazil's. In fact, such is Paraguay's surplus of electricity that its electricity prices are the lowest in South America. And it is the world's largest exporter of clean energy. The Paraguayan government hopes that the country's abundance of cheap, green electricity will attract global tech firms increasingly focused on the massive energy demands of AI computing. ""If you want to install any technology investment like AI data centres, keep in mind hydroelectric power is both renewable and steady,"" says Paraguayan software development entrepreneur Sebastian Ortiz-Chamorro. ""Compared to other renewable energy sources like wind or solar, that have their ups and downs, it's much more attractive for creating data centres or any other electro intensive activity that requires a steady electricity source."" He adds that in addition to Itaipu, and Paraguay's other large state-owned hydroelectric plant, the Yacyretá Dam, private companies can easily build their own smaller facilities. On a visit to California last year Paraguay's President Santiago Peña spoke with companies like Google and OpenAI to encourage them to invest in Paraguay. It remains to be seen if such industry giants open large operations in the country. Minister of Technology and Communication Gustavo Villate is working closely with the president on the continuing efforts. ""We have the youngest population. We have a lot of renewable green energy. We have low taxes and economic stability,"" he says proudly. I'm taken on a tour with the minister of a planned new digital park near Asunción's main airport. It's currently green fields and some army barracks. Mr Villate unfurls plans to show off the lakes, a childcare centre and other buildings which he says should be ready in under two years. ""The government are going to invest around $20m (£15m) for the first stage, but the idea is for private companies to invest the rest,"" he says. Even though the park isn't ready yet, Mr Villate says the collaboration already happening between the public, private and university sectors is key to building an ecosystem to attract foreign investors. The government thinks the country's young population will be a key attraction, and able to provide a large tech workforce. The average age in Paraguay is 27. Vanessa Cañete Vanessa Cañete says Paraguay is working hard to train more young people in technology But more young people will need to be trained. The technology minister says the new digital park will also be home to The University of Technology, which is a joint venture between Taiwan and Paraguay. Meanwhile, there are other initiatives to train young people in the country. ""We are working really hard to create a mass of software engineers, programmers and everything you need to provide software services,"" says Vanessa Cañete, president of trade group Paraguayan Chamber of the Software Industry. Ms Cañete says she is also passionate about encouraging more women to study computer engineering. In 2017 she set up Girls Code, a non-profit association which aims to close the tech gender gap. It organises programming and robotics workshops for teenagers and young women,  with more than 1,000 receiving some sort of training to date. Ms Cañete adds that software developers are also given English lessons for up to four years to improve their communication with overseas firms. The people I met are brimming with positivity about what Paraguay has to offer the tech world, but they are also pragmatic. Ms Cibils says there are still ""growing pains"" for foreign investors, with issues like bureaucracy, which can hold things up adapting local contracts to standardised international ones. But she is adamant that ""if you put innovation at its core and leverage all the benefits that the country has I think Paraguay can be a superpower"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g92xq8wdlo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7e5a/live/0a198ff0-986d-11f0-8ac5-61a603230ddd.jpg,2025-10-12T23:32:04.719000+00:00,3ee7b696f4054906aa0f97b3dec4238061747dfb
cdbed14af9b3,Shamans openly using psychedelic drugs for treatment in South Africa,,"Shamans openly using psychedelic drugs for treatment in South Africa Claire Mawisa , Marco Oriunto , Nicky Troll and Jo Munnik BBC Africa Eye, Cape Town & London BBC Although psychedelic drugs are illegal in South Africa, many self-appointed healers and shamans based in Cape Town are openly advertising that they incorporate them in their therapies. Anyone convicted of their commercial use faces a fine, a prison sentence of up to 25 years, or both. Photographer Stuart Dods is one of those willing to take the treatment from a shaman. In an elegant wooden cabin nestled in the forest on Cape Town's outskirts, he is about to undergo his second psychedelic experience to treat a series of mental health issues he has been suffering from. He has tried prescription medication but is convinced psychedelics hold the key to his healing. ""Mum passed away suddenly, so that was a hell of a thing. And then my ex broke off a year after mum died as well. So that's kind of when the rug got pulled out a little bit,"" says the 53-year-old. At a cost of around $2,000 (£1,500), the psychedelic experience he has chosen involves taking doses of psilocybin (also known as magic mushrooms) and MDMA (also known as the party drug, ecstasy). The organisers say the fee also includes accommodation and a package of support services. There is a growing body of research and trials into their effectiveness in treating  mental health conditions, but there are warnings about their use outside of controlled, clinical settings. Megan Hardy prepares the mushrooms before administering a dose to Stuart Dods Megan Hardy, who refers to herself as a ""medicine woman"" and is in charge of the session with Mr Dods, also takes a smaller dose of both drugs ahead of the ritual. She claims it helps her ""move into the same frequencies"" as the person she is treating. ""The shamanic term is a foot in each world,"" she says. Ms Hardy is aware of the illegality of using these types of drugs, but she claims the use is ""righteous civil disobedience"". When asked what qualified her to determine the correct dose to administer, she said that over the years she had tested the drugs on herself, ""learning what works in what situation"". Greater awareness of mental health issues, coupled with a rise in the clinical trials involving psychedelics, has fuelled public interest in the use of these drugs to treat conditions like depression, anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One in two people worldwide may develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime, according to studies from Harvard Medical School and the University of Queensland - treating it has become a multi-billion-dollar business. Before the psychedelic ceremony begins, which Stuart has agreed for the BBC World Service to film, Ms Hardy reassures her client he can stop at any time. ""If any of it feels uncomfortable or it's a triggering process... communicate that and say: 'OK, stop.'"" Her colleague, Kate Ferguson, has also micro-dosed on MDMA and magic mushrooms. Neither guide has had formal medical training. Mr Dods lies down on a thin mattress on the floor of the cabin, covered with a grey duvet. He is wearing an eye mask. As the drugs begin to take effect, he seems to alternate between states of calm and moments of twitching and jerking. ""Let yourself feel it,"" whispers Ms Hardy, hugging him. The two women move around the room, burning herbs and shaking shamanic rattles while singing and chanting in a purification ritual known as ""smudging"". Ms Hardy fans Mr Dods's body using the wing of a bird, in what she says is an attempt at clearing ""negative energy"". She then offers him more MDMA. He has already consented to this before the ritual began but when Ms Hardy asks him whether he needs it, he shrugs and says: ""I don't know.'"" The BBC questions Mr Dods afterwards about how he could consent to taking more drugs when he was already in an altered state. ""There was no coercion. It was more just me figuring out in that space, do I want to take this? I had every opportunity to say: 'Yay', 'nay', or 'yeah, I'll take it,'"" he says. But there are many people in the professional world of psychiatry who point to the dangers of this unregulated industry. ""In order to give consent, you have to be in touch with reality,"" said Dr Marcelle Stastny, the convenor of the South African Society of Psychiatrists. ""If a person has already had psilocybin and MDMA, they aren't in touch with reality. They're intoxicated, they're high. And [in] a lot of the trials worldwide, real boundary violations are happening."" The BBC asked Ms Hardy if being under the effect of the drugs herself while leading the psychedelic experience did not compromise her ability to take care of Mr Dods. ""That's based on the assumption that a sober state of mind is more desirable,"" said the self-styled healer. ""We're working in ways that the Western mind doesn't understand and can seem scary."" There is a growing body of research looking into whether psychedelics could be a viable alternative treatment for conditions like depression or anxiety and substance misuse. In 2022, one of the largest peer-reviewed studies on the therapeutic use of psychedelics involved giving 233 participants a synthetic formulation of psilocybin. It found that a 25mg dose administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists, resulted in improvement of a patient-reported measure of depression. However, a review study published in 2025 by the European Medicines Agency, which looked at a total of 595 participants across eight completed studies, recommended ""more clinical evidence"" before authorising it for sale. It also warned that taking psychedelics can trigger ""increases in heart rate, blood pressure and anxiety levels"", highlighting the need of administering these substances in a ""controlled environment"". Psychedelic substances remain illegal around much of the world. Yet that has not curbed the growth of the industry in South Africa, evidenced by the increasing number of services being advertised online. ""I think it's a huge problem,"" said Dr Stastny. ""It certainly has been exploding in Cape Town, particularly. People are lost and disconnected. Everybody's looking for a pill to fix everything, and there simply isn't a pill to fix everything"". Sonette Hill no longer administers psychedelic drugs but believes they can ""heal the world"" A few years ago, Sonette Hill, another self-appointed psychedelic guide from Cape Town, gave her patient Ibogaine, a powerful psychedelic extracted from plants endemic to the tropical forests of Central and West-Central Africa. It unleashed an unexpected effect. ""He grabbed me by my throat,"" says Ms Hill. ""He wanted to kill me. Something came over him and he just wanted to kill me."" Ibogaine can be used as a powerful detox drug for people suffering from addiction. It is illegal to buy or use in South Africa and only permitted under strict medical and pharmaceutical regulation. No criminal case was opened against Ms Hill and since then, she has moved away from administering psychedelic drugs to other people. But it has not changed her view on the industry itself. ""I, honest to God, think psychedelics can heal the world. I don't have any faith in the medical world,"" she says. In another case, 26-year-old Milo Martinovic travelled to South Africa seeking help for substance addiction. He ended up in an unregistered facility, treated by a dentist, and was given Ibogaine. Six hours later, he was dead. The unregistered clinic had missed he was addicted to Xanax, a benzodiazepine that cannot be mixed with Ibogaine. ​​​In 2024, the dentist, Dr Anwar Jeewa was found guilty on multiple charges, including culpable homicide. The death was just one of dozens of recorded fatalities linked to Ibogaine globally. ""You can't call something a medicine if it's not,"" says Dr Stastny. ""I have seen new patients who have been dissociated for prolonged periods after using a psilocybin trip."" The evidence around using psychedelics as medicine may be nascent, but the online market of self-proclaimed healers offering curated journeys involving various illegal substances is booming. ""They just know that they took a trip, felt great, and want to help people,"" says Dr Stastny. ""Those are the best of them. The worst of them have got this kind of narcissistic inflation where they go: 'I can help people, I can do better than the psychiatrists'."" Back in the forest cabin in Cape Town, the effects of Stuart Dod's ""journey"" begin to wear off. He says he does not feel ""healed"", but he believes he is on his way there. ""I wanted to get [more] self-awareness and understand myself,"" he says. ""I can feel that it's kind of opening stuff up, where I probably will do another journey as well after this.""

56709fd56351,'Hostages set for release' and 'Hope amid the chaos',,"'Hostages set for release' and 'Hope amid the chaos' The imminent release of Israeli hostages by Hamas is the focus for most of Monday morning's papers, with the Times dubbing it an ""historic opportunity to end the war in Gaza"". According to the paper, Hamas says they have custody of all 20 living hostages, and will begin releasing them on Monday under the first phase of the ceasefire plan. US President Donald Trump is expected to land in Israel shortly after the first hostages have been freed. ""Hostages set for freedom in key step to end Gaza war"" declares the Guardian, reporting that Israeli hostages freed by Hamas will be driven to a military base to reunite with their families, or taken to hospital if medical care is needed. Following their delivery to Israeli soil, Israel is expected to free around 2000 Palestinian detainees in what the paper calls the ""crucial next phase"" of the ceasefire deal. ""Hope amid the chaos"" reads the Mirror's headline, paired with a photograph of an aid truck in Khan Younis that has been overrun by people desperate for supplies. The paper says Israel and Gaza are on ""the cusp of a precarious peace"", but points to concerns that ""one wrong move will spell disaster"". The Mail calls Monday a ""day of destiny"", and writes that the ""eyes of the world"" are on Gaza and Israel as they await the hostage exchange. ""The day they feared would never come"" says the Metro, noting that ""last minute tensions"" remain in Israel despite their agreement to the peace deal negotiated by Trump. The paper says that Israeli special forces are on standby to escort the hostages out of Gaza on Monday, and have orders to disperse crowds using air strikes ""if necessary"". The US president is pictured front and centre of the Telegraph, snapped boarding Air Force One as he departed for Israel on Sunday. The paper reports that Sir Keir Starmer will announce £20m of UK aid for Gaza on Monday, as he joins other world leaders for a ""peace summit"" in Egypt ahead of the hostage release. The i Paper also leads on the ""historic summit"" in Egypt, and reports that former prime minister Sir Tony Blair will join Sir Keir and the leaders of 20 other nations at the signing of the truce on Monday. Sir Tony is expected to take a role on the ""Board of Peace"" at Trump's request, which the president says will supervise Gaza's governance following the ceasefire. A ""revolutionary new MRI procedure"" is the lead story for the Daily Express, which reports on ""pioneering research"" that has led to the development of an MRI scan that could take less than seven minutes. The ""breakthrough"" could double NHS capacity for the scans, and according to the paper, would boost diagnosis rates for dementia. US investment banking revenue is expected to top $9bn (£6.7bn) for the first time since 2021, which the Financial Times attributes to the ""Trump effect"". The paper says the increase of 13% on last year ""reflects growing optimism on Wall Street"". The Sun reveals that footballer Marcus Rashford has been hit by building delays that could cost up to £15m, as he builds his ""dream home"" in Cheshire.

b1d47155eb1c,Trump says he may send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine,,"US President Donald Trump is considering sending Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide ""a new step of aggression"" in its war with Russia. When asked on Air Force One if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied ""we'll see... I may"". It follows a second phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia. Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations. Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine. Trump spoke to reporters as he flew to Israel. He said he would possibly speak to Russia about the Tomahawks requested by Ukraine. ""I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it."" ""Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,"" the president said. Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict. In their phone calls Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have come under repeated heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing power cuts. Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News ""there are no such things as sanctuaries"" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war. Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, downplayed the chances of Tomahawks changing the course of the war. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last month: ""Whether it's Tomahawks or other missiles, they won't be able to change the dynamic.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xpqgzkv0o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/222d/live/597d8190-a7d7-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T03:40:00.301000+00:00,af49fea92ee1ae8d7ab40d7bd278a3a735faaaf2
012236f09725,Ben Davies: Wales and Spurs' reluctant star,,"When Davies was asked about that block before Wales met Slovakia again three years later, he simply remarked: ""It's a good memory, but hopefully I won't have to do it again this time around."" Those moments are all well and good, Davies thought, but he would prefer a straightforward victory, a clean sheet and, frankly, less of a fuss. By this time, however, he had already joined Tottenham, with whom he would play in one of the most extraordinary ties in Champions League history. Just 24 hours after Liverpool had overturned a 3-0 first-leg deficit to stun Barcelona at Anfield, Spurs mounted another comeback for the ages against Ajax. Trailing 3-0 on aggregate with 35 minutes left to play in Amsterdam, two Lucas Moura goals had dragged Spurs back into contention. Then in the sixth minute of added time, Davies intercepted an Ajax clearance to launch the counter-attack which culminated in Moura's hat-trick and sealed the most dumbfounding of triumphs on away goals. At the final whistle, it was telling that then-Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, overcome with emotion, ran on to the pitch and leapt into Davies' arms. The Welshman had been Pochettino's first signing following his appointment in 2014 and, five years later, Davies was the first person with whom the Argentine shared his greatest moment as Spurs boss. ""He is still young, but his mentality, his maturity - he is so professional - he is helping the team every season,"" said Pochettino. ""He's fantastic, not only today but from the day he arrived. He's a great professional, a great player and a great man."" Davies is now Tottenham's longest-serving current player, with more than 300 appearances to his name. Son Heung-min, who left Spurs during the summer of 2025, was one Davies' best friends at the north London club. ""Ben is one of my closest friends,"" Son said in 2023. ""He helped me settle in London very well."" Davies and Son caught a train from London to Cardiff together before Wales played South Korea in a friendly in September 2023. True to form and even with one of the world's most globally renowned footballers for company, Davies managed to navigate the journey without much attention, gave Son a hug goodbye on the platform at Cardiff Central and set off to rejoin the Wales squad.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62nyn61l6ro,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/6fdd/live/459d6100-a78b-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-13T03:34:49.003000+00:00,9c36a1c92e887cb4208b0716873a5ae2f0eddd57
2ed3b967d87b,Sikh man with tumour held by US immigration denied medical care - family,,"For over two months, Paramjit Singh, 48, a US green card holder battling a brain tumour and a heart condition, has been held in a detention centre by US immigration authorities. Mr Singh, an Indian passport holder, has lived in the US on a green card since 1994. He lives in Indiana with his family, who own a chain of gas stations. His wife and two children are US citizens. But Mr Singh now faces the threat of deportation. On 30 July, he was detained by immigration authorities at Chicago O'Hare International Airport while returning from a trip to India and has since been in their custody. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities have cited two decades-old cases as reasons for his detention, but Mr Singh's family and lawyer say there are no active cases against him. They accuse immigration authorities of using old cases to delay his release and allege he lacks proper medical care despite a brain tumour and heart condition. ""Paramjit Singh is not getting the medical help he needs. He is only getting medical check-ups,"" his lawyer, Louis Angeles, told the BBC. The BBC has asked ICE for a response to these allegations. Mr Singh has regularly visited India without immigration issues, his niece Kiran Virk told the BBC. This time, his family waited seven hours at Chicago airport for his arrival. Ms Virk says immigration officials told them Mr Singh was detained over a 1999 case. He was held at the airport for five days despite family appeals, before being moved to a Clay County detention centre in Indiana. The case involves Mr Singh using a public phone without paying. Court records show he served 10 days in prison and paid a $4,137.50 fine. The conviction has blocked his US citizenship. Ms Virk alleges immigration authorities said at a court hearing that Mr Singh still faced a one-and-a-half-year sentence, with only 10 days dismissed. Immigration authorities also say that Mr Singh was convicted of a forgery offence in Illinois in 2008, but his family contends that there are no such charges against him. Ms Virk said that the authorities cited the forgery case to stay Mr Singh's release on a $10,000 bond granted by an immigration judge. She said a private detective hired by the family found no criminal records for a person named Paramjit Singh in the state, suggesting authorities may have mistaken him for someone else. The BBC has asked ICE for a response to the family's claim that there is no forgery case against Mr Singh in Illinois. Mr Singh's lawyer told the BBC he plans to challenge the detention, calling it ""unethical"". ""We are also taking legal steps to block him from being deported from the US,"" Mr Angeles told the BBC. Meanwhile, Mr Singh's family is increasingly worried about his health, as his second brain tumour surgery has been delayed due to detention, Ms Virk says. She says the family struggles to contact Mr Singh at the detention centre, where limited phones and his poor health make communication difficult. Mr Singh's case is set to be heard on 14 October. His detention comes amid a wider crackdown by US President Donald Trump's administration on immigration, and especially illegal immigrants in the US. Trump has said he wants to deport the ""worst of the worst"", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted. In September, Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old grandmother who spent more than three decades living in the US was deported to India , sparking anger among the Sikh community.

""I've had several traumatic experiences within England camp,"" he said. ""Some discrimination and some just old-school mentality that's really unacceptable."" Racism had become normalised in dressing rooms, in Burrell's experience. ""It's something that has been dressed up as banter and that's been the problem that I've personally suffered and seen,"" said Burrell, who is of Jamaican descent. ""Over a period of time you just learn to believe that it's the norm and that is fine and that it's not malicious, but that's nonsense."" Burrell says he was eventually spurred to speak out after a team-mate at Newcastle referred to him as a ""slave"" and told him to put sun cream on his wrists and ankles ""where your shackles were"". The RFU said Burrell's revelations had led to ""a deeper look at the culture within the elite game and to the implementation of an action plan for the professional game"". ""The RFU has placed significant focus on inclusion and diversity in rugby union and a great deal of work undertaken both before and since Luther Burrell came forward and shared his experiences of racism and classism,"" it added. ""We are continuing work with clubs and stakeholders in the professional game to strive for a culture of inclusivity but acknowledge this takes time and is an ongoing process."" Every Prem and PWR club now has face-to-face education on building inclusive cultures, with its success monitored via individual reports and surveys. All England players, including age-grade squads, are trained in being ""active bystanders"" to intervene and protect others from harmful behaviour. ""You should be so proud of what you have done,"" Burrell's mother Joyce told him as part of the BBC iPlayer documentary Luther Burrell - Rugby, Racism and Redemption.

df89edf7afd3,By-election shines new spotlight on historic Caerphilly,,"By-election shines new spotlight on historic Caerphilly Elliw Gwawr Wales political correspondent Getty Images Caerphilly Castle is Britain's second biggest, after Windsor Castle From its imposing castle to its industrial past, Caerphilly is an area steeped in history, and for more than a century this constituency has voted Labour in every Westminster and Senedd election. Visitors come from afar to see Wales' largest castle, but the by-election called after the sudden death of former Labour member Hefin David has shone a new spotlight on this town. In the last Senedd election, in 2021, Labour won with a majority of 5,000 over Plaid Cymru, who were just ahead of the Conservatives. But if recent opinion polling is to be believed, then it suggests Labour has a real fight on its hands this time. Its candidate Richard Tunnicliffe, a former children's book publisher, believes that he can offer something different and says that he's willing to be a ""critical friend"" to the government in Cardiff. On a visit to Lansbury Park, one of the most deprived areas in the constituency, he said that crime and anti-social behaviour were big issues for people in the area. ""They want cleaner streets, and a community they can be proud of,"" he said. ""They basically want people to invest in their community, they want the problems of the anti-social behaviour to go away."" He added that people were calling for ""more investment in their community, they want things to get better"". But the other parties sense an opportunity to challenge Labour's dominance. Lindsay Whittle, the Plaid Cymru candidate, has plenty of experience fighting elections in this area, having stood here 13 times before, as well as being a local councillor. Speaking at a foodbank, he said Plaid offered ""radical and real change"". ""Whilst people may continually talk about stop the boats, you've got problems with the NHS, you've got problems with the cost of living, the rising price of food, the rising price of gas, electricity, fuel, that's what affects everybody's daily lives,"" he said. Reform had fewer than 500 votes here in the last Senedd election in 2021 but is confident of improving substantially on that. In last year's UK general election Reform came third with just over 20% of the vote - although that election was fought on slightly different constituency boundaries. Its candidate, Llyr Powell, said that he did not believe that ""voters have been listened to in this area for a very long time"". ""I understand the real issues affecting people here in Wales. Living here in Caerphilly I understand the issues that we haven't got an A&E service like we were promised, living here I understand the level of council of tax we're paying, the closures of our front line services. ""I think Reform understands the voters a lot more."" Regular bus user Ian Mickiewicz believes ""things could be a lot better"" Gareth Potter, the Conservative candidate, said his main issue was fixing local services. ""The biggest thing for us is fixing the NHS system that has been broken by Labour and Plaid, also our economy. We're seeing high streets dying across the region and across Wales and that is our biggest mission, as well as our education system."" Four other parties are also standing. Gareth Hughes, from the Green Party, is calling for more green jobs for people where they live and better public services - including more evening bus services. The Liberal Democrat Steve Aicheler wants to prioritise education and ""fix the social care crisis"" to free up the Welsh NHS and reduce waiting times. Anthony Cook is standing for Gwlad and the UKIP candidate is Roger Quilliam. There is clearly a strong sense of community in this part of the Rhymney Valley and people feel pride in their local area. But they want improvement too and people's concerns are varied, be it buses, healthcare, or the state of the high street. ""This town should be thriving, there shouldn't be any shops shut,"" said Wayne, who was stood next to an empty retail space in Caerphilly town centre. ""We've got a castle over there that attracts thousands of visitors a year and they've got to drive through, basically, a dump. ""At least make it look attractive to visitors, don't let the town die on its feet."" Heather Street worries about the impact of a swimming pool closing Another shopper in the town, Stephanie Dickson, was concerned about local traffic. ""The traffic is terrible, trying to getting all the way from Senghenydd to Abertridwr is a real issue,"" she said. ""We've got a big development in Abertridwr on the site of the old Windsor colliery,"" she explained, ""again the traffic seems to be a big problem, it doesn't seem to have the infrastructure to support it"". The area's coal mining past is never far away. The old miner's hospital in Caerphilly is now a cafe and community hub. Ian Mickiewicz, a regular bus user, said he thought ""things could be a lot better"". ""At Nantgarw they've just built a recent bus stop. They've put that in place, but there are no seats. ""If they have a half hour [to] 40 minutes to wait then, whilst the shelter is useful, it's no fun at all if you've got to stand in a barren isolated location waiting for that bus to turn up."" Getty Images The Caerphilly constituency covers an area beyond the town itself, including Hengoed and Bargoed to the north Caerphilly constituency is much bigger than the town itself, it extends up to Bargoed in the north and to Machen in the east. At a nursery in Machen, childcare was a big concern for the staff, but so was the closure of the swimming pool in Bedwas. ""Children go there after school on their own,"" said Heather Street, ""but if that closes where are they going to go then?"" Her colleague, Steph Bolter, was concerned about the affect on school swimming lessons. ""They're going to have to travel further, schools ain't going to be able to afford to pay for the coaches to go to a swimming pool that's further down the road,"" she said. Many people have welcomed the focus on their area that this by-election brings, and every party is working hard to gain their support. Because this election is not just about sending one representative to the Senedd, it is also about creating the right foundation for success in the Senedd election next May.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czew7nedd8jo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b570/live/85c13390-a530-11f0-8469-192d9823e9a2.jpg,2025-10-13T05:18:05.396000+00:00,382229b112e18c11a8db8d5d02718f23621591e2

The Buccaneers fans think so By Paul Higham BBC Sport Journalist With a third of the NFL season gone teams are starting to show their true colours, with some surprising names leading the pack. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts became the first teams to reach five wins as they continued their impressive starts to the campaign. The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots are emerging as contenders, while the Pittsburgh Steelers are looking comfortable in the AFC North. The season looks over already for one of the big pre-season Super Bowl favourites Baltimore, but things could just be getting going for the Kansas City Chiefs. Baker Mayfield gets MVP shouts Is Baker Mayfield an MVP candidate? That's what Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans were chanting after another all-action display from their quarterback in a 30-19 win over the San Francisco 49ers. The 30-year-old is the main reason the Buccaneers are 5-1 and he led from the front again, throwing two touchdowns and making all the big plays - including an incredible third down run when he barged through tackler after tackler to get a crucial first down. ""He has a knack that you can't teach or coach,"" said head coach Todd Bowles. ""It was an unbelievable play."" Mayfield's clutch plays had led to all four previous wins coming in the final minute - the more decisive manner on Sunday only enhanced his growing MVP claims. Daniel Jones is a similar redemption story in Indianapolis after the Colts beat the Arizona Cardinals to go to 5-1 - their best start since 2009. Running back Jonathan Taylor is the other star of the Colts' surprise start, but Jones makes big plays at the right time - recording two passing touchdowns and one rushing on Sunday. No Maye-be about it - the Pats are back Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The Pats have already matched their four wins from each of the past two seasons Being a New England Patriots quarterback comes with a unique pressure thanks to Tom Brady, but in Drake Maye they could finally have their next face of the franchise. In just his second season, Maye looks poised in the pocket and is not scared to air the ball out - throwing touchdowns of 25, 29 and 53 yards and having a 61-yarder ruled out by a penalty in Sunday's win at the New Orleans Saints. He's just the fourth quarterback under 24 to record five straight games with 200-plus passing yards and a passer rating of 100 and above. The last two being a primetime win in Buffalo then, in the deafening noise of the Superdome, show why Pats fans are getting excited that - with new head coach Mike Vrabel - they could be back in business. The Seattle Seahawks joined the Patriots on 4-2 as they won their ninth straight away game - an impressive 20-12 victory at the Jacksonville Jaguars. Sam Darnold is showing last year's resurgence in Minnesota was no fluke and he has one of the best receivers in the game in Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who made eight catches for 163 yards and a touchdown in Florida. Pittsburgh's play-off path opens up The Pittsburgh Steelers moved to 4-1 with a 22nd consecutive home win over the Cleveland Browns in the regular season - and they look to have an open door to the play-offs now in a weakened AFC North. It's usually one of the toughest divisions around but Aaron Rodgers' 4-1 Steelers look in total control, with their rivals all flagging. The Browns have just one win and a continuously messy quarterback situation, while the Baltimore Ravens look done for after a 17-3 home defeat by the Los Angeles Rams dropped them to 1-5. Only four teams in NFL history have made the play-offs after a 1-5 start and, with Lamar Jackson leading an all-star injury list, Baltimore will not be adding to that stat. The Cincinnati Bengals lost 18-27 in Green Bay to drop to 2-4, with 40-year-old Joe Flacco not exactly a like-for-like replacement for Joe Burrow. Cincy's fortunes were summed up when Evan McPherson booted an NFL record 67-yard field goal, only to see it called back as the Packers had called a time out. He missed the second attempt. Dowdle destroys Dallas in shootout Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Rico Dowdle was unstoppable for the Panthers against his former team Dallas The Dallas Cowboys were in their customary weekly shootout - which comes with having a top offence and the worst defence, but they lost to a last-gasp field goal by the Carolina Panthers. Former Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle did the damage, with another monster game of 234 total yards and a touchdown. After a similar outing last week he warned his former team-mates that they ""better buckle up"", and he backed it up with his huge day. ""They wasn't buckled up,"" was Dowdle's post-game response. The Los Angeles Chargers were another team to leave it late, as they avoided a third straight loss by hitting a game-winning field goal as time expired against the Miami Dolphins to stay top of the AFC West. Feisty Chiefs show signs of life The Kansas City Chiefs trail both the Chargers and Denver Broncos in a division they've won nine years running - but things look to be heading in the right direction. Patrick Mahomes threw three touchdowns and ran in another for a rejuvenated Chiefs offence in a comprehensive 30-17 home win over the Detroit Lions. The 4-2 Lions had a depleted secondary, but the Chiefs looked balanced in attack and the defence stifled Jared Goff's top-scoring offence. A punch-up after the final whistle showed just how big both sides felt the game was, as the Chiefs evened out their record at 3-3 but more importantly showed that they're not ready for their dynasty to end just yet. The Las Vegas Raiders may be the also-rans of the division, but they were still good enough to beat the Tennessee Titans 20-10.

e700191f28fc,'He's giving us a lot of joy' - Rashford's revival at Barcelona,,"Rashford arrived in Barcelona determined to make his mark and launch a positive new chapter in an up-and-down career. The club have the option of signing him on a permanent basis for Â£30.3m (35m euros) in 2026, but that is something that Deco told Spanish media would only be discussed at a later date. ""It's too early to talk about decisions for next season but what matters is that we're happy with him,"" the director of football said. This was reiterated by another source at the club, who said: ""We're all delighted and thrilled with him and his performance, Deco, Flick, and his team-mates. Marcus is also happy with us, with his team-mates and with the city of Barcelona. ""It's obvious that if he continues to develop like this, there's a very good chance that this will be the case. But we're only at the beginning of the season and it's still too early to talk about this."" Barcelona have big fixtures to come before the next round of international matches, including a derby against Girona, Champions League games against Olympiacos and Club Brugge, and the Clasico against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Off the back of successive defeats by Paris St-Germain and Sevilla, and with Raphinha returning from injury, Spanish media suggest Flick will be making some tactical changes. For Rashford, it presents an opportunity to adapt and demonstrate his versatility as his quest continues for a consistent starting role.

70299e7f7c31,Why centurion O'Neill 'fits Northern Ireland perfectly',,"Although O'Neill resigned in April 2020 to take charge of Stoke, his absence lasted only 28 internationals and he returned to the post in December 2022. The group to which he returned, however, was radically different to the one he left. Injury ended the international careers of Steven Davis and Dallas earlier than expected, while the retirements of Jonny Evans and Craig Cathcart robbed the group of yet more experienced campaigners. Leading such a young group presented a different challenge to his first spell, but the impact of O'Neill's previous time in charge still counted in his favour. ""You saw the success that he had before and he's a massive name back home,"" said Liverpool's Conor Bradley who has been given a leadership role in the team by O'Neill. ""He's a special manager. He gives you confidence going into games, and it's a big part of management to be able to do that, but tactically as well he's top notch."" Bingham gave O'Neill his international debut in February 1988 when he was still just 18-years-old and only four months after Newcastle United had signed him from Irish League side Coleraine. With his new-look Northern Ireland side built around young talents like Bradley, Isaac Price, Shea Charles and Justin Devenny, O'Neill feels the belief shown in him as a teenager has proven instructive to his approach to international management. ""Billy put a lot of faith in me and maybe the fact that he put that faith in me has influenced me to put faith in young players as well,"" he said. One such player is Isaac Price who was given his international debut as a 19-year-old who had played just 13 senior minutes for Everton. ""He's been perfect for me. He brought me in at a time he didn't have to,"" said Price, who later moved to Standard Liege and is now with West Brom. ""I was playing under-23s football at Everton and he saw something in me he thought he could use and develop."" Price became the youngest player to score 10 times for Northern Ireland when he netted against Germany in the 3-1 defeat last month. The 22-year-old had missed a penalty against Luxembourg three days prior to scoring in Cologne and credits a brief exchange with O'Neill as vital in quickly moving on from his poor performance. ""You've missed a penalty, didn't play very well, and it's a bit of a low point. You feel like everything's coming down and then you're going to play Germany,"" he added. ""The night before the game Michael comes over to me and just says 'forget about what happened the other night, you'll go out and do something' and then it happens. ""That's his experience. Michael has been around football so long, he'd have seen it with so many players. He just managed me really well.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g7gvw37k7o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/3153/live/5ed88b50-a799-11f0-8c9e-87f67f3eb58c.jpg,2025-10-13T06:11:46.299000+00:00,a9d513142ea2a8fd7810e94c7ce40d2ba315e706
662b8c867537,Witkoff praises PM aide's 'tireless efforts' on Gaza,,"Witkoff praises PM aide's 'tireless efforts' on Gaza Kate Whannel Political reporter and Henry Zeffman Chief political correspondent EPA The US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has praised the ""incredible input and tireless efforts"" of the UK's National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell in bringing about the ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post, Witkoff also said he wanted to ""acknowledge the vital role of the UK in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel"". The comments sharply contrast with those of Mike Huckabee, the US's ambassador in Israel, who said a UK minister was ""delusional"" for suggesting the UK played a ""key role"" in the process. The specific and personal praise for Powell from Witkoff is a boost to the national security adviser at a moment of political vulnerability. Powell is facing pressure over what role he played in the collapsed court case against two men accused of spying for China. Sources in government had for some time been emphasising the strength of the relationship between Powell and Witkoff. The two men are said to be in almost daily contact. Their relationship has become closer through their work on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with Powell playing an instrumental role in trying to rebuild the US-Ukraine relationship after President Trump and President Zelensky's public confrontation in the Oval Office in February. Powell was also in Egypt last week as negotiations over the ceasefire were being finalised. Some in government expect Powell's experience of negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland will be called upon by the US and others in the coming weeks and months, especially on the issue of decommissioning of weapons. On Sunday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Sky News the UK had ""played a key role behind the scenes"" in shaping the Gaza peace plan and had been involved in ""complex matters of diplomacy"". Responding on the social media platform X, Huckabee said: ""I assure you she's delusional. She can thank Donald Trump anytime just to set the record straight."" Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel added to Huckabee's criticism arguing that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had ""actually pushed Hamas to embolden their position"". However, on Monday, Witkoff publicly lauded the UK's involvement and specifically the role of Jonathan Powell. Asked about his praise, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""I was not born yesterday. ""I think it is actually very sad that the government is having to beg people to send tweets to say something nice about Jonathan Powell. ""I think that that is quite tragic, the way that the UK's reputation is falling under this Labour government."" Sir Keir Starmer has travelled to Egypt, where US President Donald Trump and negotiators from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will sign the peace plan. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is also expected to attend the international summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, along with world leaders from around 20 countries. The ceasefire brokered by Trump in Gaza began on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of the peace plan. The last 20 of the Israeli hostages have been released and are now back in Israel, and Hamas is due to hand over the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Gaza Strip. Getty Images In September Powell met Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Than Sir Keir Starmer appointed Powell as his national security adviser in November last year, taking over from Sir Tim Barrow. The holder of the post is always appointed by the prime minister but is normally a civil servant. Powell, in contrast, is a special adviser - a political appointee whose wages are paid by taxpayers. Powell was instrumental in brokering the 1998 peace deal in Northern Ireland when he was chief of staff to then Prime Minister Tony Blair. He left Downing Street after 10 years and went on to set up Inter-mediate, a conflict resolution charity which has helped negotiate peace agreements in Colombia, Mozambique and Spain. Bronwen Maddox, director of the international relations think tank Chatham House told BBC Radio 4's Profile that Powell made the case that to achieve peace people had to talk to their enemies ""even if they have blood on their hands"". Talking previously about the process of negotiation, Powell has said: ""It's much harder to kill people when you know them.

f3e20689d462,Reeves urged to avoid 'half-baked' tax fixes in Budget,,"Reeves urged to avoid 'half-baked' tax fixes in Budget Michael Sheils McNamee Business reporter EPA Chancellor Rachel Reeves should avoid ""directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes"" when trying to boost the government's tax take in next month's Budget, a leading think tank has said. Taxes are widely expected to go up in the Budget, with pressure on the chancellor to raise money in order to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward. The Treasury said the chancellor had been clear the Budget would strike a balance between funding public services while encouraging growth. Some analysts have estimated Reeves will have to find money to fill a black hole in the region of £20bn by either increasing taxes or cutting spending in order to meet her rules, which she has described as ""non-negotiable"". The two main rules are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament In its manifesto for the 2024 general election, Labour promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people. Tax trade-offs The IFS report looks at a number of trade-offs the government could make in an effort to bring in more income. Beyond the three main taxes, the IFS cautions there are ""serious constraints"" on the next four biggest taxes - corporation tax, council tax, business rates and fuel duties - and that ""some other tax-raising options would be especially economically harmful"". Options the IFS suggests include: doubling council tax on the most expensive properties, which could raise £4bn abolish relief on inheritance tax for main homes, which could raise £6bn extending the current freeze on income tax thresholds, which is due to end in 2028, which it says could raise ""a significant amount"". Speaking to the BBC in September, Rachel Reeves did not rule this out. The think tank warns against a wealth tax, which it said would face ""huge practical challenges"", potentially penalising savings and encouraging wealthier people to leave the country. The IFS also noted that restricting income tax relief for pension contributions could potentially raise a large sum but should be avoided as it would be ""unfair and distortionary"". It said there were ""better options"" for increasing tax on pensions, such as reforming the tax-free element. Tax reform The IFS's analysis comes in an extract from its annual Green Budget, which looks at the challenges facing the chancellor. In it, the think tank urged wider reform to the tax system which would align ""overall tax rates across different forms of income"", something it says would be ""fairer and more growth friendly"". It suggests reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as ""good places to start"". Speaking to the Today programme IFS director Helen Miller called stamp duty an ""absolutely awful tax"" and said council tax, which is based on 1991 property valuations, was ""ludicrously out of date"" and ""regressive"". ""Make it a tax based on up-to-date property values, make it proportional, and raise revenue from that rather than the current council tax and stamp duty,"" she added. She said that Reeves' last Budget, which most notably increased National Insurance on employers, had left ""only losers"", whereas making reforms to the tax system would mean ""you could have some winners"". ""If you do a reform approach, you can say you're doing something for a principled reason, and make the system better, make us all better off, ultimately,"" she said. ""At least you've got some good news to go alongside the inevitable upset from raised taxes."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has been clear that at Budget she will strike the right balance between making sure that we have enough money to fund our public services, whilst also ensuring that we can bring growth and investment to businesses.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n08n15w2o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13d9/live/98a29640-a5d3-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-13T09:55:34.276000+00:00,36f300150d006d7a90264072baf016307ea61081
c7eb631dc9cf,"'Long and painful nightmare finally over,' Trump tells Israel's parliament",,"'Long and painful nightmare finally over,' Trump tells Israel's parliament Watch: 'It will be a golden age for the Middle East' - Trump US President Donald Trump has told cheering Israeli lawmakers that ""the long and painful nightmare is finally over"", after helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. During the first such address by a US president since 2008, Trump said the day would mark ""the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better"" in the Middle East. Trump's address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, comes on the day that the last 20 living hostages held in the Palestinian enclave were released by Hamas. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza. During a whirlwind trip to the region, Trump will also attend a peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and other world leaders. After hearing politicians' chants of ""Trump, Trump, Trump"" in the Knesset, the American president suggested the region was experiencing ""the historic dawn of a new Middle East"". It echoed the words he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency. ""At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,"" Trump said. The ceasefire that he helped to broker was ""the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever"", Trump added. He indicated that ending the war between Russia and Ukraine would be his next focus. Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming ""bad"" and ""heated"". Trump's speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said ""Recognise Palestine"". At least one person was escorted out of the room. Trump was introduced to parliament by Netanyahu, who saluted his counterpart's various acts of solidarity with Israel. Trump was the ""greatest friend"" Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said. ""Everything changed"" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, Netanyahu added. The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his ""unremitting help"" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas. Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: ""He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great."" Reuters Trump was the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said The ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated. Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a ""board of peace"" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory. In his remarks to parliament, Netanyahu said he was ""committed to this peace"". Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire.

94f5d907f6d8,Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by Israel,,"Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by Israel Tom Bennett Ramallah, occupied West Bank EPA Hundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk. They were freed as part of an exchange in which 20 Israeli hostages were released by Hamas, with the remains of some deceased hostages also expected to be released. ""He is ready to embrace freedom,"" said Amro Abdullah, 24, who was waiting for his cousin Rashid Omar, 48, who was arrested in July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court after being found guilty of murder and other crimes. ""I want peace,"" Mr Abudullah said. ""I want to live a happy life, safe and peaceful, without occupation and without restrictions."" It is thought about 100 prisoners were released into the West Bank, with many others set to be deported and a small number freed into East Jerusalem. Reuters Israel made clear before the release process that it wanted to avoid the jubilant scenes that surrounded prisoners arriving in Ramallah during previous hostage deals, when large crowds waved Hamas flags. Many families were reluctant to speak to the media, saying they had been warned against doing so by the Israeli military. In Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the hope of being reunited with their loved ones. A field hospital adjacent to the main hospital building was set up to receive them. ""This is a very beautiful feeling - happy, a day of joy,"" said Muhammad Hasan Saeed Dawood, 50, who told the BBC he was there to collect his son who he says was arrested by Israeli forces at a checkpoint. ""We call it a national holiday, that our detainees are being released despite the cost of the war, the martyrs, the injured, and the destruction in Gaza."" Khalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous, who was also there to collect his son who he said had been detained for about three months, said: ""There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow."" ""We came here waiting for their release. We came here expecting them to arrive at 10:00, and now it is past 12:00, and we are still waiting, on edge."" AFP via Getty Images Buses of freed Palestinian detainees arrived in Khan Younis, southern Gaza to cheers from gathered crowds Ahead of the release in Ramallah, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society set up in preparation to treat any injured prisoners. ""The crying and the silence, this shows you how the families are feeling,"" said Ibrahim Ifani, 23, a volunteer nurse for the organisation. ""For all the people in Palestine, it's a deep, deep emotion,"" he said. Multiple medics and family members said the prisoners who were released in Ramallah had faced beatings in recent days prior to their release. The BBC cannot verify claims of mistreatment in Israeli prisons. But Israel's top court said last month that Palestinian prisoners were not being given adequate food . The BBC has also previously reported on Palestinians being tortured in Israeli detention . ""Their rights were violated in the most serious ways,"" said Aya Shreiteh, 26, from the Palestinian Prisoners Club. ""Most of the prisoners in the past year were subjected to deliberate starvation and exposure to illness,"" she told the BBC. ""Their bodies are frail from starvation, and they've suffered from beatings."" ""But today gives us hope that there will always be an inevitable freedom, no matter the circumstances,"" she added. The hostage and prisoner exchange formed part of phase one of Donald Trump's peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Israel launched a retaliatory military offensive which saw more than 67,682 Palestinians killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire took hold on Friday - and negotiations are now expected to follow over the latter phases of Trump's peace plan.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr430epq45go,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fcb/live/ecdfe520-a833-11f0-9f09-57500e5dbf06.jpg,2025-10-13T13:18:43.122000+00:00,909a8e98adde6220bbfc7c0f8c3b2a8323e6468e
70bdec0ee55f,Who are the released hostages?,,"Who are the released hostages? BBC The Israeli military says 20 living hostages have been released by Hamas and have returned to Israel. Until Monday, 48 hostages were still being held in Gaza, although  some are believed to be dead. All but one of the hostages were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Hostages who Israel says have been released IDF Israel shared images of some of the released hostages meeting with the IDF in Gaza on Monday - pictured is Ziv Berman Ariel Cunio , 28, was abducted in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. Ariel's brother Eitan, who escaped the Hamas-led gunmen, said the last message from Ariel said: ""We are in a horror movie."" Ariel's partner, Arbel Yehud, was freed in January 2025 under a deal that saw Hamas hand over 25 living and eight dead hostages during a two-month ceasefire. David Cunio , 35, another of Ariel's brothers, was also kidnapped from Nir Oz. David's wife Sharon Aloni Cunio and their then-three-year-old twin daughters Ema and Yuly were among the 105 hostages released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Sharon's sister Danielle Aloni and her daughter Emilia were also freed. In February 2025, David's family said released hostages had told them that had recently seen him alive. Gali and Ziv Berman , 28-year-old twin brothers, were abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza with their neighbour, Emily Damari. Ziv was held with Emily for 40 days before they were separated. She was released in January 2025 during the last ceasefire. Gali and Ziv's family said they had been informed by other hostages released in early 2025 that they were still alive. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Twins Gali and Ziv Berman were taken hostage along with their British-Israeli neighbour Emily Damari, who has since been released Matan Angrest , a 22-year-old Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier, was in a tank that was attacked near the Gaza perimeter fence on 7 October. One video showed a crowd pulling him from the tank unconscious and injured. Earlier this year, his family said they had been told by released hostages that he was suffering from chronic asthma, untreated burns and infections. Matan Zangauker , 25, was taken with his partner Ilana Gritzewsky from Nir Oz. Ilana was released during the November 2023 ceasefire. In December 2024, Hamas released a video showing Matan in captivity. He said he and his fellow hostages were suffering from skin ailments, shortages of food, water and medicine. Eitan Horn , 38, an Israeli-Argentine dual national, was kidnapped along with his elder brother Yair from Nir Oz. Yair was freed in February 2025 during the last ceasefire. Hamas released a video at the time showing Eitan and Yair hugging and breaking down in tears ahead of the latter's release. ""Every day we imagined what we'd do if we were freed,"" Yair recalled recently. Nimrod Cohen , 21, was serving as an IDF soldier when his tank was attacked by Hamas at Nahal Oz. In February 2025, his family were told by one of the released hostages that he was still alive in captivity but in poor physical and mental shape. After the new ceasefire was agreed, his mother Viki posted on social media: ""My child, you are coming home."" Omri Miran , 48, was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz. His wife, Lishay, said she last saw him being driven away in his own car. She and their two young daughters, Roni and Alma, were not taken with him. In April 2025, Hamas released a video showing Omri marking his 48th birthday. In response: Lishay said: ""I always said and I always knew, Omri is a survivor."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Hamas published a video earlier this year purporting to show Omri Miran alive Guy Gilboa-Dalal , 24, attended the Nova music festival, where dozens of people were taken hostage, with his brother, Gal. The last time they saw each other was just before Hamas launched its first barrage of rockets into Israel at the start of the attack. Gal evaded the gunmen on the ground, but Guy was kidnapped. Last month, Hamas released a video showing Guy and another hostage, Alon Ohel, being driven around Gaza City in late August as the Israeli military prepared to launch an offensive there. Alon Ohel , 24, has Israeli, German and Serbian citizenship. Hamas footage showed him being taken away as a hostage from the Nova festival. Alon was not seen in another video until August 2025, when he was filmed being driven around Gaza City with Guy Gilboa-Dalal. Last month, Alon's family approved the publication of a still from a new video which they said showed he had gone blind in one eye. Yosef-Chaim Ohana , 25, had been at the festival with a friend, who said they had remained to help people escape the gunfire before running themselves. In May 2025, Hamas published a video showing Yosef and another hostage, Elkana Bohbot. Yosef is seen sitting beside Elkana, who is lying on the ground. An intravenous drip is hooked up to the wall next to Elkana. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Yosef-Chaim Ohana was captured while trying to help others flee Hamas gunmen Elkana Bohbot, 36, was working at the festival when he was abducted. ""In our last conversation on the morning of the massacre at 07:00, I told him, 'It's not just missiles, come home,' and he promised he would return,"" his wife Rikva said in March 2025. The previous month, Israeli media cited a released hostage as saying Elkana, who has asthma, was being held in inhumane conditions and had developed a severe skin disease. Avinatan Or , 32, was kidnapped at the festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, but they were immediately separated. Noa and three other hostages were rescued in an Israeli military operation in central Gaza in June 2024. In March 2025, Avinatan's family said they had received a sign that he was still alive. His British-Israeli mother, Ditza, has said she just wants to put her ear to his chest and hear his heartbeat again. Eitan Mor , 25, was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival. His father Mor said he saved dozens of people before being kidnapped by Hamas gunmen. In February 2025, Eitan's family said they had received a sign of life from him. Three months later, they said a released hostage who spent time with him in a tunnel had told them how he had acted as a ""spokesman to the captors"" and ""lifted everyone's spirits"". Maxim Herkin , 37, is an Israel-Russian dual national who was invited to the festival at the last moment. His two friends were among the 378 people killed in the attack. In April 2025, Maxim appeared in a Hamas video along with Bar Kupershtein - the first signs of life from either man since they were taken hostage. The following month, Maxim was seen alone in another video and appeared to be bandaged up. Hamas said was the result of an Israeli air strike. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Maxim Herkin is one of two dual nationals believed to still be alive in Hamas captivity Bar Kupershtein , 23, was working at the festival and stayed behind during the attack to help treat casualties. He told his grandmother that he would head home as soon as they were finished. But he was later identified in a video of hostages. They heard no further information about him until April 2025, when he was seen in a video with Maxim Herkin. Segev Kalfon , 27, was running away from the festival with a friend when he was taken hostage by Hamas gunmen. Two months later, the Israeli military found a video of the abduction. In February 2025, released hostage Ohad Ben Ami told Segev's father, Kobi, that they had been held captive with four other men in a tunnel in ""terrible conditions"". Evyatar David , 24, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks. He texted the family to say ""they are bombarding the party"". His family say they later received a text from an unknown number, containing video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. In August 2025, Hamas published a video of an emaciated and weak Evyatar in a tunnel. The footage caused outrage in Israel and deep concern among his family. ""He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment,"" said his brother Ilay. Rom Braslabski , 21, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. In August 2025, Palestinian Islamic Jihad published a video of Rom, in which he is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and ""is at death's door"". Medical experts said he was suffering from ""deliberate, prolonged, and systematic starvation"". Hostages whose conditions are unknown Tamir Nimrodi , 20, was an education officer in the IDF at the Erez Crossing on 7 October. The last time his mother, Herut, saw him was in a video of his abduction posted on social media that day. Since then, she has received no signs of life and his fate is unknown. Bipin Joshi , 24, a Nepalese agriculture student, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Alumim. Footage from 7 October 2023 showed him walking inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. His family received no signs of life for a year, until the Israeli military shared a video showing him in captivity around November 2023. The family released the footage just before the new ceasefire was announced, describing it as ""proof of life"". However, Nepal's ambassador to Israel has now told the BBC that Israeli authorities have said there are no signs that Bipin has survived. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Bipin Joshi is one of two men whose status is uncertain Hostages who are confirmed dead Tamir Adar , 38, was a member of Nir Oz's community security squad who was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack, his kibbutz announced in January 2024.

d5c12bb692e4,Dutch government takes control of China-owned chip firm,,"Dutch government takes control of China-owned chip firm Osmond Chia Business reporter Getty Images Nexperia is based in the Netherlands and operates factories worldwide, including in the UK The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, in a bid to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods and protect Europe's economic security. The Hague said it took the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. Nexperia's owner Wingtech said on Monday that it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support. The development threatens to raise tensions between the European Union and China, which have increased in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. In December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport , after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the ""highly exceptional"" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over ""acute signals of serious governance shortcomings"" within Nexperia. ""These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security."" The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share. 'Mitigating risk' The Goods Availability Act is designed to allow the Hague to intervene in companies under exceptional circumstances. These include threats to the country's economic security and to ensure the supply of critical goods. Under the order, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, could reverse or block Nexperia's decisions if they were potentially harmful to the company's interests, to its future as a business in the Netherlands or Europe, or to ensure supply remains available in an emergency. The Dutch government added the company's production can continue as normal. ""This measure is intended to mitigate that risk,"" the ministry said. Shanghai-listed shares in Nexperia's parent company Wingtech fell by 10% on Monday morning. A Nexperia spokesperson said the company ""complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,"" and had no further comment. In a statement in Mandarin, Wingtech said its operations were continuing uninterrupted and it remained in close communication with its suppliers and customers. Wingtech said in a stock filing that the company's chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order earlier this month. The company was also in talks with lawyers about potential legal remedies, it added. The BBC has also contacted the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands and Brussels.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk21nng0vo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dda7/live/b22b30a0-a7cb-11f0-b50c-8f62428b85e3.jpg,2025-10-13T09:25:50.769000+00:00,a1c556ebf1bcc9f965bbcd901bef0a7d9c72c5cd

The crash happened on Sunday night as the bus was moving through ""a mountainous section"" of the N1 highway in South Africa's Limpopo province, local transport officials said. ""It [then] veered off the road along a steep mountain pass and plunged down an embankment,"" they added. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa mourned the high death toll, which includes seven children, and said this was not only a tragedy for the country but for ""our sister states of Zimbabwe and Malawi"" as well. The cause of the accident is unknown but an investigation has been launched. According to reports, the bus was travelling from the city of Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape. It is not clear how many people were travelling on the bus when it crashed, or its capacity.

e3cd07ded0bd,US calls for China to release 30 leaders of influential underground church,,"It is unclear if the detainees have been formally charged. ""Such systematic persecution is not only an affront to the Church of God but also a public challenge to the international community,"" Zion Church said in a statement. Urging China to release the church leaders, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Sunday that ""this crackdown further demonstrates how the CCP exercises hostility towards Christians who reject Party interference in their faith and choose to worship at unregistered house churches"". Former US vice-president Mike Pence and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo have also released statements on X condemning the arrests. When asked about the arrests at a press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said he was not aware of the case. He added: ""The Chinese government governs religious affairs in accordance with the law, and protects the religious freedom of citizens and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues."" This could be yet another source of friction in the US-China relationship with trade tensions once again ramping up between the world's two biggest economies over tariffs and export controls. Already, there is doubt over whether a summit between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, which was expected to happen in South Korea later this month, will proceed. Under Xi, Beijing has cracked down even more on religious freedom, especially against Christians and Muslims. At a national conference on religion in 2016, he called on the party to ""guide those [who are] religious to love their country, protect the unification of their motherland and serve the overall interests of the Chinese nation"". Despite this, there has been a growing movement of unregistered house churches in China. Among them is Zion Church, which Mr Jin started in 2007 with just 20 people. Its network now includes some 10,000 people in 40 cities across the country, making it one of the largest underground churches in China. In September 2018, the Party officially banned the church after it resisted government pressure to install security cameras at its property in Beijing. Mr Jin and several church leaders were detained briefly. Many of its branch congregations across the country have since been investigated and shut down. Mr Jin's family relocated to the US for safety, while he remained in China to pastor his flock. Authorities have barred him from leaving the country. Still the church continued to gather in small groups and shared its sermons online. ChinaAid has called this roundup of Christian leaders - which involved police across several cities - unprecedented, and the ""most extensive and coordinated wave of persecution"" against Christians in over four decades. ""This new nationwide campaign echoes the darkest days of the 1980s, when urban churches first re-emerged from the Cultural Revolution,"" said ChinaAid's founder Bob Fu, referring to a period of mass purges in the 1960s and 1970s which triggered  violence and huge upheaval across China. In a letter seeking prayers, Mr Jin's wife Liu Chunli wrote that her heart is ""filled with a mix of shock, grief, sorrow, worry, and righteous anger"". Mr Jin ""simply [did] what any faithful pastor would do... He is innocent!"" she wrote, adding that her family's hopes for a reunion after being separated for more than seven years have been dashed yet again. Several house churches in China have also issued statements calling for the release of those detained.

According to the police, the child ""accidentally discharged"" the firearm, though the exact circumstances of the shooting are still under investigation. His 43-year-old father has been arrested and is expected to be charged with negligent handling of a firearm. The two are due to appear in court on Monday. Police said they were alerted to the shooting and on arrival at the scene discovered the body of a man believed to be in his 30s lying on his side with a gunshot wound. He was declared dead at the scene. Saturday's shooting in Thabazimbi, Limpopo province, has renewed concern over firearm safety and parental responsibility in the country. The firearm was seized as evidence. ""This heart-breaking incident serves as a reminder that firearms must be handled with the utmost care and stored securely at all times,"" Limpopo police chief Thembi Hadebe said. She added that parents and guardians have a responsibility to ensure that ""children do not have access to firearms under any circumstances"". Local media report that the incident has deeply shocked the local farming community and raised public concern about the risks of children accessing weapons in rural households. Earlier this month, police said they had opened a murder charge against an eight-year-old boy after he fatally shot his seven-year-old cousin with his father's firearm in Eastern Cape province. His 48-year-old father was charged with failure to safeguard the firearm.

8e0f7714293c,India and Canada reset ties after strain of Sikh leader's murder,,"India and Canada reset ties after strain of Sikh leader's murder Neyaz Farooquee BBC News, Delhi PTI Anita Anand (left) with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi India and Canada have agreed a host of steps at talks between their foreign ministers in Delhi aimed at restoring ties that plummeted after a Sikh separatist leader was assassinated on Canadian soil. Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand, making her first official visit to India, met her counterpart S Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi told her the visit would strengthen ""efforts to impart new momentum"" to the two countries' partnership. Relations hit rock bottom in 2023 when Canada's then PM Justin Trudeau accused India of being linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , claims Delhi denied. Both countries suspended visa services and expelled each other's top diplomats . Canada is home to nearly 1.7 million people of Indian origin and the developments were being watched anxiously in both countries. After the meeting of their foreign ministers in Delhi, the two sides announced a series of measures, including starting ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade and investment. ""Reviving this partnership will not only create opportunities for enhanced economic cooperation but also help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from shifting global alliances,"" a joint statement said. Signs of a thaw have appeared this year since Mark Carney took over as Canadian prime minister. In June, Carney and Modi held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada. Two months later, the countries appointed new high commissioners to each other's countries. Anand and Jaishankar also met each other on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York in September. X/MEA Jaishankar said India-Canada ties had been making steady progress On Monday, Jaishankar said that India-Canada bilateral relations have been steadily progressing in the last few months. ""When we look at Canada, we see a complementary economy. We see another open society. We see diversity and pluralism,"" he said, adding that this was ""the basis for a close sustainable and long-term co-operative framework"". ""We are collectively committed to advancing this relationship now and in the long term, particularly when it comes to our mutual priorities in the Indo-Pacific,"" Anand said. The two countries will resume the Canada–India CEO Forum, which brings together executives from both countries to increase bilateral trade and investment. The announcement comes as Delhi deals with a punitive 50% tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian goods. Anand is also set to meet India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to discuss boosting trade ties, before visiting Mumbai to speak to business leaders about investments and economic opportunities. She will then travel to China and Singapore as part of Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy that focuses on deepening the country's engagement in the region.

3426ae199bac,A photo worth a thousand words: Taliban minister with Indian female journalists,,"A photo worth a thousand words: Taliban minister with Indian female journalists Geeta Pandey BBC News, Delhi Reuters Female journalists occupied front-row seats at the Afghan Taliban foreign minister's press conference in Delhi on Sunday It's often said that a picture can speak a thousand words. The one in Indian newspapers on Monday morning showing female journalists occupying front-row seats at the Afghan Taliban foreign minister's press conference in Delhi is certainly one of those. The conference - the second press event by Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy in about 48 hours - was called after a huge uproar over the exclusion of women from his first meeting on Friday. Muttaqi said at Sunday's conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not ""deliberate"". ""With regard to the [Friday's] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific. ""It was more a technical issue... Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,"" he added. The UN has referred to the situation in Afghanistan as ""gender apartheid"" where women and girls are not allowed to attend secondary school or university, visit parks or gyms. The jobs they are allowed to do are increasingly restricted and the Taliban government enforces head-to-toe coverings and restricts their travel. The Taliban government, which retook power in 2021, has previously said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law, but Western diplomats have said their attempts to gain recognition have been hampered by the curbs on women. The suppression of women's rights under their rule is the harshest in the world. Muttaqi arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government. Delhi has not formally recognised Afghanistan's de facto rulers, but it is one of a number of countries that maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with them, even maintaining a small mission in Kabul and sending humanitarian aid there. The visit is being seen as a ramping up of relations between the countries and is key for both - the Taliban government receives a boost in its quest for recognition, while India advances its strategic and security interests. On Friday, Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates. A source in the Taliban government had admitted women had not been invited to attend. India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it ""had no involvement in the press interaction"" as it was held at the Afghan embassy. But the gender discrimination on Indian soil angered politicians and journalists who criticised the government for letting it happen. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them"". Indian Ministry of External Affairs / Handout via Getty Images Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi (L) with Indian counterpart S Jaishankar (R) The Editors Guild of India, the Indian Women's Press Corps (IWPC) and the Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI), issued strong statements, calling the exclusion ""highly discriminatory"". ""While diplomatic premises may claim protection under the Vienna Convention, that cannot justify blatant gender discrimination in press access on Indian soil,"" the Guild said. ""Whether or not the MEA co-ordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection,"" it added. The NWMI said it was the Indian government's ""responsibility to uphold the democratic rights and constitutional freedoms of female citizens, including their right to work and  livelihood"" and that they should have questioned such ""blatant gender discrimination"". The group also criticised male journalists who attended Friday's conference for not standing up for their female colleagues. ""In moments like these, silence can be seen as complicity in normalising gender discrimination,"" the statement said. Amid growing outrage in India, Muttaqi's team sent out fresh invitations for Sunday's interaction, describing it as an ""inclusive"" event open to all media personnel. It's not clear what led to the second press meet - though there is no official confirmation, there has been some speculation that the Indian government may have intervened. The conference was well attended and the minister was asked some hard-hitting questions about the reason for keeping out women from Friday's meeting - and the rights of Afghan girls and women. ""We have 10 million students in schools and institutes, including over 2.8 million women and girls. In madrassas, education continues up to graduation,"" Muttaqi responded. ""Some limits exist, but we've never declared women's education religiously haram [forbidden], it's only postponed until further order,"" he said. Many journalists who attended the press conference questioned the minister's claim, pointing out the restrictions the Taliban have imposed on girls and women since 2021. Over the past four years, girls over the age of 12 were banned from getting an education and job options for women have been severely restricted. In recent weeks, the Taliban government also removed books written by women from universities in Afghanistan. The minister's response to follow-up questions on women's rights in Afghanistan may not have been satisfactory. But, as some journalists pointed out, the very fact that the second press conference was organised and that the minister took questions on gender issues can be seen as progress.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gze7ely6vo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d00a/live/8aa4f8f0-a7fc-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T10:27:56.023000+00:00,bf83011de6c635196b133e8207d34514232138aa

e76a6087332b,Your nose gets colder when you're stressed. These thermal images show the change,,"Your nose gets colder when you're stressed. These thermal images show the change Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Watch science correspondent Victoria Gill put herself through a thermal imaging stress test When I was asked to give an impromptu five-minute speech and then to count backwards in intervals of 17 - all in front of a panel of three strangers - the acute stress was written on my face. That is because psychologists from the University of Sussex were filming this somewhat terrifying experience for a research project that is studying stress using thermal cameras. Stress alters the blood flow in the face, and scientists have discovered that the drop in temperature of a person's nose can be used as a measure of stress levels, and to monitor recovery. Thermal imaging, according to the psychologists behind the study could be a ""game changer"" in stress research. Kevin Church/BBC The temperature drop in the nose, seen in the thermal image on the right, happens because stress affects our blood flow. The experimental stress test that I subjected myself to is carefully controlled and  deliberately designed to be an unpleasant surprise. I arrived at the university with no idea what I was in for. First, I was asked to sit, relax and listen to white noise through a set of headphones. So far, so calming. Then, the researcher who was running the test invited a panel of three strangers into the room. They all stared at me silently as the researcher informed that I now had three minutes to prepare a five minute speech about my ""dream job"". As I felt the heat rise around my neck, the scientists captured my face changing colour through their thermal camera. My nose quickly dropped in temperature - turning blue on the thermal image -  as I considered how to bluster my way through this unplanned presentation. (I decided I would take the opportunity to make my pitch to join the astronaut training programme!) The Sussex researchers have carried out this same stress test on 29 volunteers. In each, they saw their nose dip in temperature by between three and six degrees. My nose dropped in temperature by two degrees, as my nervous system pushed blood flow away from my nose and to my eyes and ears - a physical reaction to help me to look and listen for danger. Most participants, like me, recovered quickly; their noses warmed to pre-stressed levels within a few minutes. Lead researcher, Prof Gillian Forrester explained that being a reporter and broadcaster has probably made me ""quite habituated to being put in stressful positions"". ""You are used to the camera and talking with strangers, so you're probably quite resilient to social stressors,"" she explained. ""But even someone like you, trained to be in stressful situations, shows a biological blood flow shift, so that suggests this 'nasal dip' is a robust marker of a changing stress state."" Kevin Church/BBC News The 'nasal dip' happens in just a few minutes when we are acutely stressed Stress is part of life. But this discovery, the scientists say, could be used to help manage harmful levels of stress. ""The length of time it takes someone to recover from this nasal dip could be an objective measure of how well somebody regulates their stress,"" said Prof Forrester. ""If they bounce back unusually slowly, could that be a risk marker of anxiety or depression? Is it something that we can do anything about?"" Because this technique is non-invasive and measures a physical response, it could also be useful to monitor stress in babies or in people who can't communicate. The second task in my stress assessment was, in my view, even worse than the first. I was asked to count backwards from 2023 in intervals of 17. Someone on the panel of three impassive strangers stopped me every time I made a mistake and asked me to start again. I admit, I am bad at mental arithmetic. As I spent an embarrassing length of time trying to force my brain to perform subtraction, all I could think was that I wanted to flee the increasingly stuffy room. During the research, only one of the 29 volunteers for the stress test did actually ask to leave. The rest, like me, completed their tasks - presumably feeling varying degrees of humiliation - and were rewarded with another calming session of white noise through headphones at the end. Anxious apes Prof Forrester will demonstrate this new thermal stress-measuring method in front of an audience at the New Scientist Live event in London on 18 October. Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the approach is that, because thermal cameras measure a physical stress response that is innate in many primates, it can also be used in non-human apes. The researchers are currently developing its use in sanctuaries for great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas. They want to work out how to reduce stress and improve the wellbeing of animals that may have been rescued from traumatic circumstances. The team has already found that showing adult chimpanzees video footage of baby chimpanzees has a calming effect. When the researchers set up a video screen close to the rescued chimps' enclosure, they saw the noses of animals that watched the footage warm up. So, in terms of stress, watching baby animals playing is the opposite of a surprise job interview or an on-the-spot subtraction task. Gilly Forrester/University of Sussex Chimpanzees and gorillas in sanctuaries may have been rescued from traumatic circumstances Using thermal cameras in ape sanctuaries could prove to be valuable in helping rescued animals to adjust and settle in to a new social group and strange surroundings. ""They can't say how they're feeling and they can be quite good at masking how they're feeling,"" explained Marianne Paisley, a researcher from the University of Sussex who is studying great ape wellbeing. ""We've [studied] primates for the last 100 years or so to help us understand ourselves. ""Now we know so much about human mental health, so maybe we can use that and give back to them.""

565e990f1f31,The century-old ship sail technology finally catching on,,"The century-old ship sail technology finally catching on Kevin Keane Environment, energy and rural affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland Pathe News The twin Flettner rotor ship Buckau made its maiden voyage into Grangemouth in 1925 It must have been a bizarre sight when a freight ship, equipped with two large rotating towers, made its way under the Forth Bridge a century ago. The experimental sail technology, on the rotor ship Buckau, was first demonstrated in 1925 on a journey carrying timber from Danzig - now Gdansk, in Poland - to the Scottish port of Grangemouth. The spinning towers were designed to harness the wind as a way of saving fuel but it didn't catch on for about 90 years. Now the pioneering Flettner rotors are being used on at least 35 commercial freight ships to improve fuel efficiency and reduce their impact on the climate. Hulton Deutsch/Getty Images After her maiden voyage from Poland to Scotland, Buckau crossed the Atlantic to the US The original ship was modified to incorporate the tall spinning towers, which were powered by motors, as a way of saving money on fuel costs. Experts say the relatively low cost of fossil fuels, like diesel, meant it was unlikely the shipping lines of the 1920s would make back the investment required to install them. The Great Depression of 1929 was the final nail in the coffin for the design, with orders being cancelled by ship owners. But modern-day decarbonisation targets mean technologies which can improve fuel efficiency, like this one, are becoming more highly prized in the maritime sector. Norsepower Single rotors have been installed on two ferries between Germany and Denmark The technology, known as Flettner rotors, were designed by aeronautical engineers led by the German inventor Anton Flettner. The towers are powered by motors which effectively redirect the wind to generate forward thrust. It's called the Magnus effect and is the same principle which causes a spinning football to bend through the air - especially when kicked by David Beckham. Operators say it can cut fuel bills by up to 20% as well as reducing planet warming greenhouse gas emissions from burning diesel. BBC News Prof Mehmet Atlar says the technology in use today is the same as in 1925 Modern rotors are even more efficient than the ones on Buckau in 1925 because they are made with lighter composite materials such as carbon fibre. Prof Mehmet Atlar, an expert in hydrodynamics at Strathclyde University, believes there was a lot of initial interest in the design with an order book starting to grow. A larger ship was launched, called the Barbara, with a further six waiting to be built. But by the end of the 1920s, those orders were being cancelled and the design concept was shelved. He said: ""In my opinion, nothing is new. ""The need is the most important thing. The need now is there, therefore the Flettner rotor came back."" He said that the lighter materials, combined with more effective motors to drive the rotors, mean it's much more effective than a century ago. 'Sustainable solution' The Finnish company Norsepower revived the design when it began exploring fuel efficiency systems for ships more than a decade ago. It has since built 35 sails, mostly retrofitted, with orders for a further 48. The company said some ships were even being built ""rotor ready"". Chief executive Heikki Pöntynen said: ""I would say that this will become a very common sight. ""We can see the market booming and developing very fast."" He added the lighter materials were important. But Mr Pöntynen said the use of artificial intelligence, to drive the positioning of the ""sails"" against the direction of the wind, made it most effective. He also said the Flettner rotor was a ""really sustainable solution"" for decarbonising shipping. The technology can be added to any ship so long as there is sufficient deck space. That makes it ideal for freight carriers and tankers. However, Mr Pöntynen added that it would be difficult fitting the rotors to container ships which use every available space.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dqznvxylqo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b152/live/65b36cb0-a389-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg,2025-10-13T05:25:52.659000+00:00,4afebb20722b7773aba69e379c4e56f8c8e928eb
b5594a5e796c,Watchdog vows Botox crackdown after BBC exposé,,"Watchdog vows Botox crackdown after BBC exposé Guy Lynn BBC Investigations, London AFP via Getty Images The BBC caught pharmacists trying to sell Botox without assessing patients first The pharmacists' watchdog has promised to investigate and ""take action"" after the BBC exposed illegal and potentially harmful practices in the aesthetic Botox industry. Under UK law, Botox can only be supplied under prescription by a qualified medic following a face-to-face consultation with the patient, to check it is safe for them. But undercover BBC researchers caught several pharmacists trying to prescribe the medicine to beauticians to use on people who had not been clinically assessed. The General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) said it was continuing to review the BBC's evidence for its own investigation. Its chief enforcement officer Dionne Spence said: ""We will take enforcement action against pharmacies, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians when required to protect patient safety."" Under UK law, only a doctor, prescribing nurse or pharmacist, or dentist is legally allowed to prescribe botulinum toxin - commonly known as Botox – after an appropriate face-to-face clinical assessment. They are also required to ensure the medicine is supplied to an experienced injector to administer. But the BBC's investigation uncovered a series of breaches by regulated pharmacists. East London pharmacist Cornelius Agoye from Rainham was filmed selling vials of Botox to an undercover BBC reporter who was posing as a beautician intending to inject a customers Mr Agoye asked the reporter to complete paperwork that would create a false record of a patient consultation taking place. He also told the BBC he was willing to illegally supply additional Botox under the same prescription to use on other patients - which constitutes fraud. When approached by the BBC, Mr Agoye apologised and admitted his conduct had fallen below professional standards. Pharmacist Cornelius Agoye was filmed in his Rainham pharmacy selling Botox without assessing the patient Other pharmacists filmed or spoken to by BBC undercover researchers posing as beauticians described taking similar shortcuts. One suggested skipping the required face-to-face consultations and falsifying photographs to trick regulators into believing a patient had been seen. The investigation also uncovered potentially dangerous activity beyond community pharmacies. These include a nurse offering to sell prescriptions over WhatsApp for cash, and a fake doctor selling an unlicensed and potentially dangerous black market Korean medicine. Ms Spence told the BBC she was ""very concerned"" and ""incredibly disappointed"" by these findings. ""Our guidance is also clear that when providing non-surgical cosmetic medical products such as Botox, there needs to be a physical examination of the person to support a safe prescribing decision,"" she said. She said the GPhC had already tightened guidance on online supply of medicines and was working closely with the other industry watchdogs to regulate the supply of Botox prescriptions. ""We are also working with governments and policy makers to identify how the legal and regulatory framework in this area could be strengthened and any legislative gaps could be addressed,"" she said. Following concerns about unsafe practices in the aesthetics industry, the government is considering new legislation close loopholes and to crack down on ""cowboy cosmetic procedures"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was developing a new national licensing scheme for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, designed to protect patients and raise standards across the industry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddm1g470v3o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6eb7/live/d6a363c0-a5d3-11f0-b98a-8b079c99c55e.jpg,2025-10-13T05:01:36.151000+00:00,1a9f924b0df896c79f861ef2723af76cba745697
6b4aa921ad3c,A facelift at 28? Why young people are turning to plastic surgery,,"A facelift at 28? Why young people are turning to plastic surgery Ruth Clegg Health and wellbeing reporter @hotgirlenhancements The facelift is moving into new territory. A quick search on socials and my feed is inundated with posts from people in their late 20s, 30s, discussing different types of facelift - the mini, the ponytail, the deep plane. Gone are the days when facelifts were reserved for the ageing wealthy - now an increasing number of younger people are opting to go under the knife. Some happily share pictures of their face before, after and the very bruised bit in between - their often very painful recovery. It's no longer a procedure that's spoken about in secret, celebrities like Kris Jenner, Catt Sadler and Marc Jacobs have spoken openly about their treatment. Many more are rumoured to have had one. The facelift is often seen as the last resort, the most major of cosmetic surgeries. Are people becoming so insecure in an often fake online world that they will pay thousands of pounds for the operation? Or have we had so many non-surgical treatments, such as Botox and fillers, that having our skin peeled from our cheekbones and our facial tissues and fat rearranged feels like a logical - and longer lasting - next step? @hotgirlenhancements Emily, pictured here in recovery and post-surgery, says she does not regret her operation For Emily, who had a facelift at 28, it was about getting a ""snatched look"" - a sculpted, sharp jaw, high cheekbones and fox eyes. She says having surgery in Turkey was ""life-changing"" and she does not regret it. ""In total I had six surgeries rolled into one,"" she explains. ""Among them I had a mid- face lift, a lip lift and a rhinoplasty [nose job]."" Describing the process, the businesswoman from Toronto, Canada, says the surgeon played her favourite song as she went under general anaesthetic and then: ""I fell asleep and I woke up, threw up, and I had a new face and a new nose."" The recovery process was long - the pain and bruising began to subside over the first few weeks, but it took six months for Emily to regain feeling in parts of her cheeks. Would she do it again? She hesitates. ""Since my surgery, I've changed my life. I'm healthier, I drink a lot less, I look after my skin, I sleep. I think if I knew what I know now I might not have gone through with it. ""My mum didn't even know until I told her a couple of days after surgery."" But then she stops and reflects. ""But I just wanted to be the best version of myself,"" Emily says, ""and now I think I am."" Figures from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) show an 8% increase in facelifts over the past 12 months in the UK - they don't break down the figures by age, but many members report that the demographic is shifting. This is reflected in other parts of the world, with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons seeing a rise in Gen X (ages 45 to 60) opting for a facelift. Nora Nugent, president of BAAPS, believes there are a host of reasons for the change - including the rise of weight-loss medications. ""Losing weight so quickly on these drugs can leave a lot of excess skin. A facelift can help with that,"" she says. ""Techniques have developed massively - a facelift no longer means risking that 'wind tunnel' [an overly stretched face as a result of the skin being pulled back] effect on the face we saw many years ago."" BAAPS During a facelift cuts are made on both sides of the face by the ear, extending up along the hairline. An incision is then made in the muscle that controls facial expressions, so that tissues and muscle can be repositioned However, a facelift is still a significant operation that should only be undertaken by a specialist, registered plastic surgeon in a registered facility with proper equipment, she says. At his clinic in Bristol, consultant plastic surgeon Simon Lee has carried out hundreds of facelifts - and shows me a video of one. For the duration of the procedure the client is wide awake, having had low levels of local anaesthetic injected into the skin and the deeper tissue beneath. He makes a series of small incisions in her face, before going under the skin, the fat and the superficial fascia (SMAS) - the part of the face which controls our expressions - then reaching the deep plane where he repositions tissue and muscles to reshape the face. As he finishes, the client, who has been under the knife for four hours, smiles in relief. One of the reasons it's become more appealing, Mr Lee says, is the ease with which face and neck lifts can now be carried out. Once reserved for a hospital theatre and requiring a general anaesthetic, he now carries the face and neck lift without sedation in his clinic. It's an ""exciting time"" in the industry, he says, with developments happening at speed. While the classic facelift - which focuses on the lower jaw and neck is still popular, there are newer treatments which target the upper two thirds of the face - where he says, the ageing process begins and is noticeable at a younger age. The surgeon caveats this saying a facelift is suitable for those over 40, but it would be very unusual to carry out such a complex procedure on someone in their 20s and 30s. There are risks and complications involved in these kind of procedures , such as developing a hematoma - a collection of blood under the skin which, if not treated, could lead to necrosis (death of surrounding tissues), infections, nerve injury and alopecia. A facelift costs, on average, £15,000-£45,000 in the UK, but there are clinics offering these procedures for as little as £5,000. Experts say it is important to do your research and choose a plastic surgeon who specialises in facelifts. Julia Gilando Julia Gilando went to Turkey for her surgery Julia Gilando, 34, decided she needed a facelift to fix asymmetry in her face after having issues with the jaw alignment earlier in her life. Although many of her friends said they couldn't see a problem with her face, she felt it, ""trusted her gut"", and flew to Turkey for her procedure, which cost $8,000 (£6,000). Despite warnings about the risks associated with having cosmetic surgery in Turkey it has become increasingly popular to do so, mainly due to lower prices. ""At first I thought this whole idea was crazy, but I did my research and I decided to go for it,"" Ms Gilando, a healthcare professional, says. ""I was scared, I was in a foreign country, I was alone, and I didn't speak the language. ""After my surgery I spent two days in hospital and then had to fend for myself. I was so swollen I couldn't see. ""There were some dark times, it was a whole mental rollercoaster of emotions, you go through these highs and lows."" There are concerns from researchers about whether such cosmetic surgery procedures give the self-esteem and confidence the industry advertises. ""I think there's an unprecedented pressure,"" Dr Kirsty Garbett, a body image expert from the Centre of Appearance Research at the University of West England, explains. ""Especially when it comes to the face - we see ourselves on video calls, social media platforms, we compare ourselves to others so easily."" And she says, what we see isn't necessarily a true reflection of reality. ""AI, filters - all play a part in creating a fake online world. And, at the same time, we are seeing a rise in the normalisation of cosmetic procedures."" Celebrities being more outspoken about having these operations is, in some ways, a good thing, she says, but it also normalises them - making them appear ""just a part of life and that is really worrying"". Caroline Stanbury Caroline Stanbury describes her facelift as the ""best thing"" she's had done Caroline Stanbury, TV presenter and one of the Real Housewives of Dubai, had a facelift two years ago aged 47, despite everyone telling her not to do it because she was too young. ""It was the best thing I have ever had done,"" Caroline says. ""Why do I want to wait until I am in my 60s, desperate and need it? I want to look and feel amazing now."" Having spent 20 years getting regular Botox and fillers, she felt like she was ""beginning to look weird"". She paid $45,000 (£34,000) for a deep plane facelift in the US. ""I still look like me, and this procedure has given me another 20 years of feeling great,"" she says. Alexis Verpaele, a plastic surgeon based in Belgium, with clients from all over the world including the UK, says he's worried about the increasing number of younger people coming for the treatment. He often talks to these clients at length about ways certain looks can be achieved without something as major as surgery. ""If they have a facelift in their 20s, and we know it can last 10, 15 years say. ""So by the time they are 60, they might have had three facelifts,"" De Verpaele says. ""That's a lot of trauma for one face to endure - and that's the best case scenario without any complications.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxwvr57424o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/05fb/live/f899dc60-a5fc-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-11T01:05:48.821000+00:00,ed86b686afff7026f9e67572415efe628a2c857b
7640dfef0f22,England playing for 'moral' Ashes victory,,"Australia coach Andrew McDonald said on Friday that Cummins would likely need a minimum of four weeks of bowling preparation to have any chance of featuring in the first Test. Cummins agreed, saying: ""You'd want at least probably a month in the nets. ""If you play a Test match, you want to make sure you're right to bowl 20 overs in a day and you don't have to really think about it. ""So four weeks is pretty tight. But I think somewhere around that mark."" Given Cummins' timeframe, there is also no guarantee he will be fit for the second Test in Brisbane on 4 December. ""The first step is trying to kind of give me a shot at being right, and then we'll work it out,"" said Cummins. Should Cummins miss the first Test, former skipper Steve Smith is likely to captain the side - with Scott Boland stepping in for Cummins in attack.

Arsenal released a statement the day after, confirming Odegaard would miss the current international window, but did not set a timeline for his recovery.

However, the 26-year-old is set to remain unavailable until after the next set of international fixtures in the middle of November.

The news means Odegaard will miss Premier League games against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland, as well as Champions League matches against Atletico Madrid and Slavia Prague.

Litten's only previous cap arrived against France in 2023, while Burgess, who scored two tries in Hull KR's triumph over Wigan on Saturday, returns to the England set-up after a 10-year absence. But Connor, who was also omitted from the squad get-together in June, has been unable to convince head coach Shaun Wane he deserves a spot amid fierce competition in the halves. Wane's stellar options in those berths include captain George Williams, Wigan's Harry Smith and Lewis, who won the Rob Burrow Award for man of the match with a sparkling performance at Old Trafford. Australia face England at Wembley on 25 October, at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One. ""I'm really excited by the 24 players we have selected ahead of this upcoming Ashes Series,"" said Wane.

The 33-year-old succeeds Matt Bloomfield, who was sacked earlier this month having spent less than a year in charge at Kenilworth Road. It is Wilshere's first full-time managerial role, taking over a Luton side 11th in the third tier following back-to-back relegations. He beat Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens to the role and is believed to have signed a three-year deal. Chris Powell has also joined Luton as Wilshere's assistant - the former England left-back had been at Walsall for just two weeks as interim first-team coach, coming in to cover for Gary Waddock as he recovers from ankle surgery.

5427ef766d68,Why Ryder Cup players get free pass to season-ending DP World Tour play-offs,,"Comfortably outside the top 70, at first glance it would appear both need high finishes from their trip to the Delhi Golf Club to keep alive their seasons. But, in fact, they are already assured of their places in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. This is due to a little publicised but pragmatic loophole whereby members of Europe's Ryder Cup team are also considered eligible for next month's closing tournaments. Fleetwood, who won the PGA Tour's play-offs with his stirring victory at August's Tour Championship in Atlanta, lies 94th in the European tour's season-long table.  Lowry, who sank the putt that retained the Ryder Cup, is 155th. Other European team-mates who can potentially benefit are Ludvig Aberg (72nd) and Sepp Straka (147th). This might question the integrity of a play-off system, which by definition is supposed to bring cut-throat competitive jeopardy, but this scenario also illustrates realities faced by the Wentworth-based DP World Tour. They are reliant on big backers such as DP World, who are also the title sponsors of this week's event in India. They need the biggest stars at their biggest events to justify the investment, which runs to millions of dollars. Fleetwood has enjoyed one of his most successful seasons, capped by his first win on American soil at East Lake just under two months ago. He is one of European golf's superstars and, frankly, it would be unthinkable to stage the 2025 season finale without him. Common sense trumps competitive integrity, even though the world number five - a Dubai resident - has reserved his best performances for events that do not count on his home tour. Fleetwood has so far played only four DP World Tour events and failed to finish in the top 20 at any of them; the Dubai Desert Classic, Scottish Open, BMW PGA Championship or Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. The majors also count on the Race to Dubai and his share of 16th at the Open was his only top 20 in the big four tournaments.  But on the American-based circuit he enjoyed seven top-five finishes. Fleetwood was also Europe's top points scorer at Bethpage last month. It would be absurd for him not to be taking his place alongside the tour's leading stars at the end of the season. While in the past the PGA and European tours were deadly rivals they are now inextricably linked thanks to the strategic alliance that underpins DP World Tour prize funds. While Marco Penge, last week's winner of the Open De Espana, has moved into McIlroy's wing mirrors as his closest rival at the top of the Race to Dubai, much of the interest for the rest of the season will have an American bias. The narrative will be driven by the scramble for 10 places on the PGA Tour for those who do not already have playing rights in the US.  Penge, with three DPWT wins, is assured of what is widely regarded as 'promotion' to the US circuit. The Clitheroe-based pro, who also guaranteed invites to the Masters and Open with his Spanish success, is not in the India field but will mount a final push to try to overhaul McIlroy at the top of the standings. And Dan Brown, the man Penge beat in the Madrid play-off, is one of four other Britons in the thick of the battle for a 2026 PGA card. Yorkshireman John Parry and the Bath duo of Jordan Smith and Laurie Canter also currently occupy spots that would yield a golden ticket for next year. Some observers see this scenario as evidence that the DP World Tour is now nothing more than a feeder for big brother on the other side of the pond. But the DP World Tour argue it is a vital mechanism that underpins their schedule, a necessary and enticing element that maximises playing opportunities for its members. Certainly this is the time of the year where the realities and compromises of men's professional golf seem at their most evident.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cp3d57gl397o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/67e5/live/2455e4a0-a834-11f0-9f09-57500e5dbf06.jpg,2025-10-13T13:15:16.553000+00:00,5918ff384340cc01c26383751288574d2451ccad

Nurmagomedov retained his PFL lightweight world title against the Irishman in Dubai, but Khabib, who was in his corner, could be heard screaming at the Russian during some contentious moments in the fight. Nurmagomedov says he is back in the gym despite enjoying only one week of rest after the fight - on Khabib's orders. ""At first he was so happy and congratulated me,"" Usman tells BBC Sport. ""But then he said 'You have to be starting training. Because we don't have time for stopping and chilling. We're here to work'. ""I said 'OK, brother. Give me one week'. He said 'OK, one week'."" Former UFC lightweight champion Khabib turned to coaching after retiring undefeated in 2020 with 29 wins from 29 fights. Nurmagomedov's victory was his second over Hughes after a narrow win in January, but the judges' scorecards did not reflect a close battle - they scored it 50-45, 49-46 and 48-47. ""My opinion: I won every round; I took him down in every round. I threw my jab very well. And if he only did a couple of shots, I did more than him,"" said Nurmagomedov. ""In my opinion there was no 50-45. It was like 48-46 or 48-47. ""People can talk. I don't care what people think about me or my fight.

3f186b440ca3,Stokes and Wood 'raring to go' for Ashes - Carse,,"Ben Stokes and Mark Wood will be ""raring to go"" in time for the Ashes, according to England pace bowler Brydon Carse. Talismanic England skipper Stokes missed the final Test against India in July because of a shoulder injury, while express paceman Wood has not played a Test since August 2024 as a result of elbow and knee problems. Both are looking to be fit for the first Test in Perth on 21 November, a series opener that Australia captain Pat Cummins has said he is ""less likely than likely"" to feature in because of a back injury. Carse, a Durham team-mate of Stokes and Wood, said: ""Ben and Woody are going well. ""I've been down to Loughborough in the past couple of weeks, had a couple of nights with them. Ben is looking near enough 100% fit and so is Mark. I've been bowling with them. ""It's exciting to see where they have got to after their setbacks during the summer. They will be raring to go come Australia time."" Pace bowling and the durability of the respective attacks could be a decisive factor in the outcome of a five-Test Ashes series crammed into the space of seven weeks. With Aussie spearhead Cummins a huge doubt for Perth and possibly beyond, the home side will rely on Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Scott Boland, all in their mid-30s. Beyond that, their other seamers are inexperienced or untried at Test level. The group of fast bowlers named by England is set to be their fastest and most hostile to tour Australia in more than 50 years, albeit with some fitness doubts among them. By the time of the first Test, Wood will not have played any competitive cricket since February. Despite that lack of action, the 35-year-old - probably the fastest bowler in the world - often claims he is at his best when fresh. All-rounder Stokes, 34, is vital to England's Ashes hopes, but has a history of pushing himself to breaking point. He has not completed any of England's past four Test series and in the home summer against India his large bowling workload resulted in the shoulder injury. Stokes and Wood are also the only pace bowlers in the England squad to have played in a Test down under before, but Carse believes the touring seamers will not suffer for their lack of time in Australian conditions. ""You can look at it two ways,"" said Carse, speaking at the Toyota Professional Cricketers' Association awards. ""Stokesy and Woody have played in Ashes series down in Australia, so they have the experience to fall back on. ""A couple of the other seamers have played in A trips out there.

The German is younger, has managed significantly fewer matches, and does not have as much experience of Rangers or Scotland as the man he would succeed. Would all that undermine his ability to handle the myriad problems the next Rangers boss will face on and off the pitch? ""Danny Rohl is 36 years old - you can be as good a coach as you want, but is he going to have the experience of handling all the fires that need to be put out at Rangers at the moment?

Watkins was once one of Wales' most recognisable musicians - the frontman of the rock band Lostprophets. At the height of their fame, the group sold millions of albums around the world. But the group disbanded immediately after Watkins was convicted in 2013. Prosecutors described Watkins as a man corrupted by fame, drugs, and power - one who committed crimes ""beyond imagination."" His trial heard Watkins had used his fame to manipulate and control others, often under the influence of hard drugs, including crystal meth. After Watkins was sentenced, Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: ""Watkins used his status and global fame as a means to manipulate people and sexually abuse children.

Stage Stars, made by Bristol-based Drummer Television, creators of Gym Stars and Ice Stars, follows students at the Hertfordshire performing arts school. Between September 2024 and July 2025 a small crew was based at the site to capture the highs and lows of the academic year. Rachel Drummond-Hay, the programme's executive producer, said: ""This is to show kids what happens when you follow your dreams, work hard and see what you can achieve."" ""It's set up as a performing arts school, a specialist school, so that people can really follow their dreams. ""There's one boy in our first series, he goes in to compete in the world's top ballet competition in the world. He's the only UK person who gets into the finals. ""Through this series you see huge success, but you also see all the hard work and everything that goes into that."" Drummer Television/BBC The show will see students balance school life with building careers in the spotlight Tring Park has a strong track record of success, with alumni including Dame Julie Andrews, Lily James, Daisy Ridley and Thandiwe Newton. Current student Louie was in Year 10 when filming took place. ""It's kind of crazy knowing that people have done the exact same as me and have really made it,"" he said. ""I would say the school is different from other schools in the fact that everyone here is doing something that we all love."" Drummer Television/BBC Children can star attending the school from Year 3 up until sixth form Staff and students credit the school's unique structure for its success. Each day is split between academic lessons and performing arts training such as acting, dance, musical theatre or music. Places are limited and boarding fees from Year 7 are about £15,000 per term, though scholarships are available. Louie specialises in music and hopes to one day represent the UK at Eurovision. He said: ""I think anything you set your mind to and you work hard for is definitely achievable. ""But I think being in a school where so many people are doing the same things as you, it really helps to make that dream feel more real."" Drummer Television/BBC The series is currently filming more episodes to air next year Filming crews became part of the school community during production and are now working on the next series. There is plenty to capture, from big auditions and band formations to hundreds of stage performances. Director of studies, Elizabeth Odell, has watched as some former students, like Ella Henderson, have gone on to big success. She said: ""I think knowing that those people follow this path, they were at the school, they were in these rooms, they were attending those lessons, and they have achieved their goals, is inspiring. ""I've worked here for a long time, seeing people like Ella Henderson grow up and have an amazing successful career. I'm really proud. I'm really proud that I had this tiniest part in that journey.

""Hitler himself was appearing in a time which was to us young people a time of disillusionment. It was a time, we had no hope for our future, and now a man came and said you shall have hope, we can do it, we can manage it, Germany is prospering again. Of course it was a temptation big enough to think about."" Alamy Speer's Cathedral of Light saw hundreds of searchlights piercing the night sky at Nazi Party rallies (Credit: Alamy) But surely alarm bells should have rung? In 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives , the SS murdered around 400 of Hitler's opponents. Speer was sent to repurpose the office of Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen into security headquarters. In his memoir Inside the Third Reich , Speer recalled seeing a pool of dried blood where one of Papen's aides had been shot. ""I looked away and from then on avoided the room,"" he wrote. He told Charlton: ""It is a complete moral failure of mine not to have had any reactions, and it would be wrong to make now any excuses. In fact, I saw this bloodstain and I shoved it away in my memory. It was no more existent, and I was going on to work. If I would have only a little bit thought about it, I should have gone away from Hitler in this moment. But I didn't."" One of the most powerful men in the Third Reich Speer would never get to fulfil his most ambitious architectural project: a complete rebuilding of Berlin, which was to be renamed Germania , future capital of the world. At its heart, Speer envisaged a vast north-south avenue, culminating in a Great Hall with a dome 16 times higher than St Peter's in Rome. It's thought that the interior would have been so vast that when filled with the breath of 180,000 gathered Nazis, rainclouds may have formed in the ceiling. Instead, in 1939 Hitler started World War Two, and plunged Europe into six years of hell. In 1942, he made Speer minister for arms production, drawing upon his extraordinary organisational skills to meet the demands of total war. At the age of 37, the architect was now one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. To keep feeding the Nazi war machine with firepower, Speer used slave labour in his factories, mines and quarries. More than seven million forced labourers were employed by German industry, heavily concentrated in the armament sector overseen by Speer. Some were worked to death in terrible conditions. Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper told the 1996 BBC Reputations documentary, The Nazi Who Said Sorry, that Speer knew what he was doing. ""He had formidable methods of control and could use the concentration camp system if he wanted, but he got the work done, and that impressed Hitler,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251009-how-hitlers-architect-escaped-the-death-penalty,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m7phgl.jpg,2025-10-13T10:40:48.965000+00:00,e52c83ce176a5d6cc4d284a47682e1245903f8e7
1777cb1ed33f,Carmakers go on trial over emissions cheat claims,,"Carmakers go on trial over emissions cheat claims Emer Moreau Business reporter and Theo Leggett Business correspondent Getty Images A major lawsuit against five leading carmakers accused of cheating on emissions tests has started at the High Court. The trial is the latest chapter of what has become known as the ""dieselgate"" scandal, with the companies facing allegations they used software to allow their cars to reduce emissions of harmful gases under test conditions. Lawyers say the case is the largest class action in English and Welsh legal history, and could eventually involve 1.6 million car owners. The five carmakers - Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault and Nissan - all deny the accusations. These companies have been chosen by the court as lead defendants to be tried first as the case is so big. They have been accused by 220,000 car owners of misleading them over emissions tests. But depending on the outcome of this case, nine other carmakers are facing similar claims. The dieselgate scandal first emerged in September 2015, when the US Environmental Protection Agency accused Volkswagen of installing software - known as ""defeat devices"" - on diesel cars to lower readings of the cars' nitrogen oxide emissions. In 2020, the High Court ruled that Volkswagen had used defeat devices in breach of European Union rules to pass emissions tests. Volkswagen settled a class action out of court , paying £193m to 91,000 British motorists. The company has so far paid out more than €32bn (£27.8bn) over the scandal, mostly in the US. Lawyers representing drivers said that at the time of the scandal, ""the unique selling point of diesel cars was their fuel/CO2 economy"". ""Manufacturers wanted to sell vehicles with all the cost advantages of diesel but the performance (acceleration, associated drivability, lower engine noise) and convenience of petrol cars."" The lawyers will try to show car buyers were deceived about the environmental performance of their vehicles – and that some cars still on the road today are pumping out more toxic pollutants than they should. The companies involved in the case insist that, unlike Volkswagen, they have never cheated. They will argue in court that the software they used was legal and necessary to protect their engines from harm. The High Court will decide whether systems installed in diesel cars by the five carmakers were designed to cheat clean air laws. It is alleged the ""defeat devices"" allowed a car to identify when it was in a test scenario. It would then run its engine at below normal power and performance levels in order to record lower readings of nitrogen oxides. Lawyers for the motorists will claim they were deceived about how environmentally friendly the vehicles were, and that the cars still on the road are continuing to emit dangerous levels of pollution. A judgement is not expected until summer 2026. If the court finds against the carmakers, a further trial to determine levels of compensation is expected to begin in autumn 2026. Martyn Day of Leigh Day, which is one of the 22 law firms representing drivers, said: ""A decade after the Dieselgate scandal first came to light, 1.6 million UK motorists now get their chance to establish at trial whether their vehicles contained technology designed to cheat emissions tests."" He said that if the allegations against the car firms are upheld in court it ""would demonstrate one of the most egregious breaches of corporate trust in modern times"". ""It would also mean that people across the UK have been breathing in far more harmful emissions from these vehicles than they were told about, potentially putting the health of millions at risk."" The companies involved have said the claims against them are without merit. A spokesperson for Mercedes said the mechanisms used in tests were ""justifiable from a technical and legal standpoint"". Renault and Stellantis, which owns Peugeot and Citroen, said the vehicles it sold were compliant with regulations at the time. Ford said the claims had ""no merit"" and Nissan said it was ""committed to compliance in all markets in which we operate"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr5epw8dweo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3c3e/live/d3d36ef0-a804-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T11:47:57.700000+00:00,3acd351c46ff240d858834d522fc63ee9e73c471
b41cd5590149,Mortgage rates creep back up as lenders show caution,,"Mortgage rates creep back up as lenders show caution Kevin Peachey Cost of living correspondent Getty Images Average mortgage rates have risen for the first time month-on-month since February as lenders approach the winter with caution. Following a series of drops in mortgage interest rates, the picture worsened slightly for new and renewing borrowers over the last month, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. The average rate for a two, or five, year fixed rate stands at about 5%, much lower than the peak of recent years, but still a stretch for many homeowners. Analysts suggest imminent, further base rate cuts by the Bank of England appear unlikely, and uncertainty always foreshadows a Budget. Moneyfacts data shows that mortgage rates only climbed very slightly over the month, by 0.02 percentage points. That took the rate on an average two-year deal to 4.98%, and to 5.02% for the average five-year mortgage. More than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers also hope to get a place of their own with their first mortgage. All would welcome low mortgage rates. Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said that the latest situation might well ""disappoint"" borrowers. ""Volatile swap rates and a cautionary approach among lenders have led to an abrupt halt in consecutive monthly average rate falls,"" she said. Swap rates reflect the market's view of which direction the Bank of England's interest rates will go, so lenders use them to set their own rates. ""Lenders have responded cautiously, with some edging rates higher and the overall average ticking up slightly,"" said Simon Gammon, managing partner at mortgage advisers Knight Frank Finance. ""This is unlikely to mark the start of a sustained rise in borrowing costs, but rather a prolonged plateau while the outlook becomes clearer."" The rates during this October are much lower than this month two years ago, when the average rate for a two-year deal was 6.67%. Some homeowners would have become accustomed to much lower rates during the 2010s, so will now be budgeting for bigger monthly repayments, alongside other financial pressures such as the rising cost of food. The government has said it will support people with the cost of living. The Budget will be delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in November. Ms Springall, from Moneyfacts, said that borrowers should consider their own circumstances and seek guidance when required. ""It remains essential borrowers seek independent advice to navigate the mortgage maze and not feel pressured to secure a deal because of the Budget rumour mill,"" she said. On Monday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economic think-tank, said that the chancellor should avoid "" directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes "" when trying to boost the government's tax take in the Budget.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4l557n1lo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/da05/live/19aca900-a819-11f0-881e-a7ddfaa732cf.jpg,2025-10-13T10:34:43.713000+00:00,3981c124bd5b11d91541aae82a5fa0fba76c7c97

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was charged under the Terrorism Act after allegedly failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers in Folkestone in July 2024. He is on trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court and has pleaded not guilty. A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine. Robinson's trial began on Monday and is expected to last two days. He is charged under his real name and is being referred to as Mr Lennon in court. Before the hearing, the former English Defence League (EDL) leader addressed his X followers in a video taken while en route to court. He said the social media platform's billionaire owner Elon Musk - who has previously championed Mr Lennon - had ""picked up the legal bill"" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as ""state persecution"". Musk has not publicly confirmed this. In court, the 42-year-old sat in the dock wearing a navy waistcoat and tie. PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer with Kent Police, told the court that he was on duty policing vehicles travelling to France at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone on 28 July 2024. He described seeing a silver Bentley, an ""unusual car to come through"", with a lone occupant - Mr Lennon. He said that before he stopped the vehicle he ""had a belief that it was Mr Lennon"". PC Thorogood said he had asked Mr Lennon where he was going, adding that he was ""unhappy"" with the account Mr Lennon gave. ""He was travelling a far distance with a vehicle that wasn't his,"" PC Thorogood said. He said Mr Lennon had told him he was going to Benidorm and had not bought a ticket in advance, which the officer said was ""unusual"". He added that Mr Lennon did not make eye contact during the exchange. PC Thorogood also described detaining Mr Lennon under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. He said Mr Lennon started filming him, and the officers took away his mobile phone. ""He refused to provide the Pin number, saying there was journalist material in his phone,"" PC Thorogood said. Jo Morris, for the prosecution, said that Mr Lennon had used an expletive at officers, who also found a small bag in the Bentley containing £13,370 and €1,910 (£1,660). District Judge Sam Goozee said the defendant's address should not be published, after his barrister Alisdair Williamson KC said there were ""credible threats against Mr Lennon's life"".

The visit by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, from 3 to 5 December, will be the first German state visit to the UK in 27 years. King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the visit at Windsor Castle as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations. Such state visits are used to reinforce alliances and to encourage trade, with the German trip following last month's state visit by US President Donald Trump. State visits are a mix of political and business meetings, alongside royal pageantry and a diplomatic red-carpet welcome, with a banquet, military parade and carriage rides. The visit follows a treaty between Germany and the UK signed in the summer, known as the Kensington Treaty, which agreed to create a direct rail link between London and Berlin, as part of measures bringing the countries closer together. There are plans for more cultural ties such as school exchanges, stronger military links, business investments and joint efforts to tackle illegal migration and people smuggling. The King and Queen will be returning the hospitality to President Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender for their own visit to Germany in March 2023, in what was the first overseas state visit of the new reign. That first visit as King proved to be a diplomatic success , with the King making a well-received speech to the German Bundestag in Berlin, where he spoke about the importance of Germany's efforts in supporting Ukraine after the invasion by Russia. In a symbolic moment of reconciliation , he also went to Hamburg where he laid a wreath remembering those who had died in the Allied bombing of the city during the Second World War. The last German state visit to the UK was in December 1998, by President Roman Herzog, where he became the first head of state to visit Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992. Queen Elizabeth II hosted the visit and her state banquet speech spoke of the importance of both countries belonging to international organisations, ""headed by the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation"", which helped ""to extend our reach and achieve goals which would be impossible on our own"". In that 1998 speech, which would have been written with the advice of the government, she also expressed the hope that Germany would become a permanent member of the UN Security Council - which so far has not happened The announcement of the 2025 German state visit adds to what is already a busy autumn schedule for the King, who is still undergoing cancer treatment. The King and Queen will be travelling to meet Pope Leo next week, for a rearranged state visit to the Vatican.

Emma Wills, from Chilworth in Surrey, moved in to the property five months before a modified e-bike charging in her living room caught fire at the end of January. ""To go from a fresh start to losing everything so quickly has been devastating,"" she said. The e-bike, which belonged to a family friend, had recently been modified using a conversion kit bought online. According to new research from consumer safety charity Electrical Safety First, a total of 23% of UK push-bike owners surveyed were considering turning their push-bike into an e-bike. Conversion kits are cheaper to buy than a fully manufactured e-bike but come with huge risks, the charity has said. Electrical Safety First Mrs Wills said the fire destroyed all the ""sentimental keepsakes"" that remind her of her late mother Giuseppe Capanna, its product safety engineer, said: ""Kits made up of substandard components can cause devastating fires. ""At present, technology has outpaced regulation meaning there are no existing safety standards for conversion kits."" Mrs Wills, who has three children, said: ""I lost my mum in 2021, so all the memories and sentimental keepsakes I had of her are gone. ""They can never be replaced, and that breaks my heart.""

21413c1c8be4,Lloyds warns car finance scandal could cost it £2bn,,"Lloyds Banking Group is setting aside an additional £800m for car finance compensation claims, bringing the total amount allocated by the bank for redress to nearly £2bn. The company said that the number of eligible claims is expected to be higher than previously thought. Millions of drivers who bought cars on finance with hidden commission payments between 2007 and 2024 may be eligible for redress. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published details of its proposed compensation scheme last week . The FCA said payouts could be due on around 14 million unfair deals, averaging at about £700 each. This could result in lenders paying out a total of £8.2bn in compensation. The payouts are over commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information given to car buyers. Lloyds said in a statement: ""Based on the FCA proposals in their current form, the potential impact is at the adverse end of the range of previous expected outcomes."" It said it was setting aside an additional £800m for redress based on ""the increased likelihood of a higher number of historical cases... being eligible for redress"". It said its ""best estimate"" of the total cost of redress was £1.95bn. The proposed scheme would be free to access for consumers, although the interest they receive on redress will be much lower than that paid following the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. That scandal cost Lloyds £22bn. The FCA estimates that 44% of all motor finance agreements made since 2007 will be eligible for payouts. But a ruling at the Supreme Court in August limited the breadth of these cases. The FCA advises anyone who wants to make a complaint to get in touch with their lender or broker, and has this guidance on how to complain . But the Finance and Leasing Association, the body that represents the lending industry, has said the FCA is ""overcompensating"". Lloyds said on Monday that it did not think the FCA's calculations reflect the actual amount that customers lost out. It believes customers could therefore get more than the full commission back under the FCA's proposed scheme. Under the scheme, eligible car owners would be given the average of what it estimates they overpaid, and the commission paid, plus interest. Another lender, Close Brothers, which is deeply exposed to motor finance compensation, said it was also likely to need to set aside more money for payouts. In a statement on Thursday, it said its ""initial assessment"" following the FCA's proposals was that it would need to increase its current provision of £165m. However, the company pointed out that uncertainty remained over the final compensation requirements, with the current proposals under consultation.

Drivers say a number of buses and their rest areas are infested with cockroaches and say the insects need eradicating. Images and video sent to BBC London show cockroaches on buses and in eating areas. In one video, filmed on 8 October, cockroaches can be seen in a driver's food container in the rest area. Bus safety campaigners have written to transport bosses highlighting the problem. Transport for London (TfL) says such instances are rare and it has launched an urgent investigation. London Bus Forums A cockroach on a London bus Kevin Mustafa, a London bus safety campaigner, said: ""The current state is untenable for drivers who already face demanding working conditions. Swift, transparent and decisive action will go a long way toward restoring trust, ensuring safety, and maintaining public confidence in London's bus services. ""London bus drivers are reporting persistent issues with cockroaches and unsanitary conditions onboard their vehicles. This is not a matter of occasional nuisance — many drivers describe infestations, and the situation is starting to pose real health, safety and wellbeing risks."" Campaigners want a deep clean of all buses more frequently, and the use of insecticidal treatments, heat treatments, improved vacuuming and sealed barriers in known hotspots. Drivers also want pest-control measures put in place. The London Bus Forums group said: ""The cockroach reports are not isolated. They point to a wider failure to maintain safe and clean conditions for bus drivers. ""This is a public health issue affecting both staff and passengers. That's why drivers will be marching on 5 November to demand safer conditions and the adoption of the Bus Drivers Bill of Rights."" London Bus Forums A cockroach on a piece of official TfL documentation About five million bus journeys are made every day in the capital. There are 675 bus routes served by over 8,700 buses, almost all of which are operated by private companies under contract to Transport for London. A TfL spokesperson said: ""We are committed to working together with operators to provide a clean environment for staff and customers. ""Most TfL welfare facilities are cleaned multiple times a day, and at a minimum daily, to maintain hygiene and safety standards. All buses are also cleaned every night before entering service and reports such as these are rare. ""We take any report seriously and are urgently investigating the specific incidents that have been raised. ""As with any reports, we will take appropriate action as part of the investigation, which can include taking buses out of service for inspection, deep cleans and treatment with specialist equipment if necessary.

67d7e2fbd458,'We must catch up soon!' How to stop ghosting your friends,,"'We must catch up soon!' How to stop ghosting your friends Alex Taylor BBC News reporter Getty Images/BBC The time pressures of adult life can make it difficult to maintain the friendships we hold close ""We must catch up soon!"" It's a phrase near universal in adult friendships - a text we've likely both sent and received. We mean it in the moment, with the best of intentions. But between work, family and endless to-do lists, a simple catch-up can become a logistical nightmare. Yes, we must. But we rarely do. It explains why research finds we lose around half of our friends every seven years. It's not that we're suddenly ""fundamentally incompatible"", says psychologist Dr Marisa Franco, but because relationships shift as life stages change. Be it moving in with partners, getting married, focusing on our careers or starting a family, friendships become ""the easiest place for collateral damage"" for both men and women explains author Dolly Alderton. The question becomes how to maintain the same closeness with less time together. Relationship expert Claire Cohen, author of BFF? The Truth About Female Friendship, who recently had a son is experiencing this first hand. She's found herself in ""identity limbo"" between her old friends and the new group of mums she's met through antenatal classes. Claire says she wants a fully rounded group, not just people who know the ""new me"". To fix this, she's become more transparent, vulnerable, and creative in her approach to friendships during this challenging life transition. When Claire recently discovered she hadn't been invited to a social event, for example, she gently reached out and explained she would still love invites despite being busy with motherhood. Getty Images Research shows platonic bonds are needed for healthy human connection Her honesty opened up the conversation. Claire says the friend was ""reassuring"", explaining that she thought she was ""being kind"" by giving space, unaware of the hurt caused. Friendship reaffirmed, they then made time to hang out, even through the ""mundane connection"" of tidying together. Claire's experience shows how communicating honestly is key. Science underlines the importance of friendships.  A broad social circle is thought to have the same impact on your life span , as diet and exercise combined. It combats what Dr Franco calls ""relational loneliness"" -  the loss of deeper platonic bonds needed for healthy human connection. ""Even if you're around one person and you really like that person, you can still feel lonely without having friends,"" Dr Franco says. Embrace mess Making space for friendships as our life changes requires us to accept our changing circumstances and feel the discomfort. This means welcoming our friends into our messy lives, rather than waiting for perfect moments, says psychologist Julia Samuels. Going to the gym, running errands or doing a food shop with a new baby? Take a friend along. For friendships to exist, we need to give them space, however short or unusual the setting. ""If they can't do it, they can't do it. But have it in the diary,"" adds Samuels. Doing so allows us to meet in person, which experts agree should be the priority - even more so in our age of instant messaging. Other stories you may enjoy Claire agrees, particularly since giving birth. While Whatsapp messages undoubtedly help us touch base and tell people we're thinking of them, she's found them a wholly ""unsatisfactory"" catch-up replacement during maternity leave. It's a trap more of us have fallen into since the pandemic, says Dr Franco. Lockdowns normalised ""learned loneliness"" - seeing isolation as an acceptable default - alongside an over reliance on virtual communication. To avoid this, she says we need to remember that socialising is like a muscle - the more we do it, the easier it becomes. For those having to push themselves out the door, Dr Franco advises trying to reframe toward thinking about how happy our future selves will be, rather than pre-meet fears. ""When it comes to social connection, we underestimate just how happy it makes us, just how much value it brings,"" she explains. Best friends forever? So, what should you do if you want to rekindle a relationship? Dr Franco suggests a text message or voice note as an initial olive branch, perhaps highlighting a specific memory to revive the connection. When doing so, she says it's important to remember the ""liking gap""  -  the negative disconnect between how we think others perceive us and their actual opinion. We need to think of friendships as ""flexible and not fragile"" and trust that feelings do not diminish in busy or challenging times. As for meetings themselves, Claire says ""organised fun"" such as book clubs or pottery classes can alleviate the stress of hosting and make it a communal occasion. Ultimately, we need to trust that friends really will be there for us. Or, as Samuels puts it: ""Trust that you're more liked than you think you are and take a risk"".

Lindsay Rimer left her home in Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, on 7 November to buy cornflakes from a nearby shop but never returned. In April 1995, her body was found in the Rochdale Canal, about a mile from the town, weighted down with a stone. West Yorkshire Police said a man was arrested on Monday at an unnamed UK prison where he was serving a sentence for other offences. A force spokesperson said officers were ""keeping Lindsay's family updated"", adding that the arrest was ""as a result of our continued focus on progressing the investigation"". The arrested man would be interviewed by police on Monday and Tuesday and was expected to be bailed and returned to prison while inquiries continued, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, officers were approaching ""a number of specific potential witnesses, mainly in the Hebden Bridge and wider Halifax area"", who had been identified by the investigation. West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Monday's arrest was the first in the investigation into Lindsay's murder since 2017. West Yorkshire Police CCTV images show Lindsay buying cornflakes shortly before she disappeared On the night Lindsay went missing in November 1994, she had left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT before calling in to see her mother at the Trades Club, a members club and music venue in Hebden Bridge. She was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes from the Spar shop on Crown Street. The last confirmed sighting of Lindsay was not long after this, as she was seen leaning against a wall near the Memorial Garden. Her body was found by two canal workers the following spring. The search for the schoolgirl was one of the largest carried out by West Yorkshire Police. Lindsay's family has described not knowing what happened to her as ""like living a life sentence"". Alex Moss/BBC Det Ch Insp James Entwistle said police remained committed to the investigation into Lindsay's murder Confirming the new arrest, Det Ch Insp James Entwistle, senior investigating officer, said: ""We remain very firmly committed to doing everything we can to get justice for Lindsay, and to give her family the answers they still so desperately need after all these years. ""While we appreciate the understandable public interest that today's arrest will bring, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage."" Det Ch Insp Entwistle added: ""Although it is now more than 30 years since Lindsay was murdered, we remain convinced there is someone out there who has vital information that could finally help to ease her family's pain.

Biya, who at 92 is the world's oldest head of state, is being challenged by nine candidates. If he wins, it will be his eighth consecutive term in office, with the next election due in 2032. Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji said that voting took place ""hitch-free"" across the country. But there was a call for a boycott in the English-speaking regions in the west and there were reports of clashes in the north. The final result should be known within 15 days of the vote. In the run-up to the election there were complaints from the opposition of attempts to suppress their support. In August, the Constitutional Council barred 71-year old Maurice Kamto, widely viewed as the main challenger, from taking part. On Sunday, angry supporters of leading opposition candidate and former Biya ally, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, 76, took to the streets in his stronghold of Garoua. They clashed with security forces, who fired tear gas, after his residence was cordoned off. Earlier in the day, Tchiroma had said he was the subject of threats. ""It is not Tchiroma who is the problem, he told reporters, adding that he ""places himself under the protection of God and the Cameroonian people."" ""I am at home; I will not move. If they intend to come and take me away from home, I will not move,"" he declared. Despite this Interior Minister Nji said the polls were held without major incidents in all 10 regions of the country. He did not comment on the situation in Garoua but rather repeated previous claims that some presidential candidates were planning to publish the results of the election ahead of the official declaration. Nji described this as a major red line, threatening action against anyone suspected of breaking the law.

0d6c40c8d565,What could change in first England squad since Euro 2025?,,"The biggest decision for Wiegman is how she will replace Williamson in defence and whether that means a recall for 2023 World Cup captain Millie Bright. Bright withdrew from selection for Euro 2025, stating she was unable to ""give 100% mentally or physically"", but has started every WSL game for Chelsea this season. Wiegman was at Kingsmeadow on Sunday for Chelsea's win over Tottenham. ""We have a lot of conversations with Sarina and she knows exactly where my players are at,"" said Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor on Friday. ""We always make decisions together on the England players."" However, Williamson's absence could be a chance for Wiegman to hand Arsenal teenager Katie Reid a first senior call-up. The 19-year-old has been excellent so far in her breakout season, keeping fellow England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy out of the side in the process. Wiegman could also give Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier an opportunity at centre-back in these friendlies, despite preferring her at full-back for England. Elsewhere, she has decisions to make on the attacking front with Chelsea striker Aggie Beever-Jones continuing her impressive form with four goals in six games. Could she be given a run ahead of Arsenal's Alessia Russo, who has two goals and two assists in the WSL this season?

Writing in The Free Press , Allen described Keaton as ""unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again,"" adding that ""her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered"". In a long personal essay, Allen recalled first meeting Keaton in 1969 during rehearsals for his play Play It Again, Sam before going on to make eight films with her including Annie Hall, which she won best actress for at the 1977 Oscars. ""As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,"" wrote Allen. ""I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it."" In Annie Hall, Keaton played the role of the film's quirky, insecure and free-spirited titular star, who Allen's character, Alvy Singer, falls in love with. The pair were at one point romantically involved in real life. Reminiscing on the first time they met, Allen remembered thinking: ""If Huckleberry Finn [writer Mark Twain's fictional vagabond] was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton."" He added that the world was now a ""drearier"" place without her in it. ""Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head."" She starred in other Allen titles such as Manhattan, Sleeper and Radio Days. Silver Screen Collection / Contributor The pair pictured together on the set of comedy film Sleeper in 1973 Keaton remained a supporter of Allen, a controversial figure, who has been accused of molesting his daughter Dylan, which he has always denied. No charges have ever been brought against the star. She told the Guardian in 2023 : ""He gave me everything. He really did. Woody made it loose. That helped me enormously."" Silver Screen Collection / Contributor Los Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame through her role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Godfather films, before going on to feature in movies like Father of the Bride and Fellow First Wives Club. Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, like fellow US filmmaker Allen, also paid tribute to the ""extraordinary"" actress over the weekend. In a post shared on social media, Coppola said: ""Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. ""From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor.""

4b761d3e2f7f,"Powell made no decisions about evidence in China spy case, minister says",,"The government's national security adviser Jonathan Powell made no decisions about the content of any evidence provided in the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China, a minister has said. Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - in September. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed the case collapsed because the government had refused to give the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ""vital information"" as it wanted to ""curry favour"" with China. Security Minister Dan Jarvis dismissed claims the government deliberately collapsed the case as ""baseless"". Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. But last week the head of the CPS said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a ""threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences. Giving a statement to MPs in the Commons, Jarvis denied reports Mr Powell had ruled China could not be defined as a national security threat at a meeting of Whitehall officials in September, shortly before the charges were dropped. ""Of course, [the national security adviser] takes part in discussions about national security and diplomatic relations. That is literally his job,"" he said. ""But any discussions were on the basis that the case would be going ahead and how to handle the implications. ""The national security adviser was not involved in any decisions about the substance of the evidence."" Jarvis said it was deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins who provided a witness statement in December 2023 under the previous Conservative government, with further witness statements requested and provided in February and July this year. He said Mr Collins was given ""full freedom to provide evidence without interference"", adding: ""Ministers and special advisers did not take decisions about that evidence and they were not cited on the contents."" Jarvis said all the evidence provided was based on the law and the Tory government's position on China at the time of the alleged offences. He added that the decision about whether to proceed with the prosecution was taken by the CPS, ""who were hamstrung by antiquated legislation"". The Official Secrets Act of 1911 has since been replaced by the 2023 National Security Act, which Jarvis said closed ""the loopholes that have been exposed by this particular case"". ""Suggestions that the government concealed evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,"" he said. ""The [deputy national security adviser] did not materially change his evidence and was under no pressure from anyone to do so... ""What has changed is the CPS's assessment of the case law."" Jarvis sought to blame the previous Tory government for not classifying China as a threat to national security and being too ""slow"" to update national security laws. Defending her party's record, Badenoch pointed to a number of examples where Tory ministers and government documents had described China as a ""threat"". ""The trial has collapsed because for months and months, the government has been refusing to give the CPS vital information,"" she said. ""This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This looks like a deliberate decision to collapse the case and curry favour with the regime in China."" She added: ""I suspect that [ministers] have decided that closer economic ties with China were more important than due process and our national security."" The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to ""come clean on why this case fell apart"" and publish all correspondence between the deputy national security adviser and the CPS. The party's foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said: ""The government's attempts to duck scrutiny and scapegoat a single official simply won't wash. ""It's inconceivable that neither Keir Starmer nor his national security adviser knew what evidence was being submitted in such an important case.

193512538cdd,Chris Mason: SNP are the latest proof that things change quickly in politics,,"Chris Mason: SNP are the latest proof that things change quickly in politics Chris Mason Political editor in Aberdeen PA Media John Swinney was the third SNP leader in a little over a year A year or so ago, the Scottish National Party looked to be in deep trouble. They had been comprehensively thrashed in the general election , falling from 48 MPs to just nine. They had managed to have three leaders in a little over a year: Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and then John Swinney. It was a rate of attrition that would make even the Conservative Party of recent years blush. There had also been a high-profile and long-running police investigation into the SNP's finances, involving Sturgeon, who was told earlier this year she would face no action . Plus there were bitter rows over gender identity. And the SNP has been in devolved government in Scotland since before you could buy an iPhone – since May 2007. Electoral gravity looked to be catching up with them, and catching up big time – just ahead of the crucial elections to the Scottish Parliament next May. PA Media John Swinney, with Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon But in case you needed yet another reminder that our domestic politics remains a smorgasbord of competitiveness and unpredictability, the SNP is the latest case study. Swinney has brought stability to a party that indulged in the opposite for a while. And support has splintered among its rivals – Labour, Reform and others. Here is how the pollsters More in Common put it: ""Since last year's general election, Labour's support has more than halved in Scotland while the SNP has marginally improved its standing. While not seeing as significant a rise as in England, Reform has emerged as the potential second-place party after the SNP in Scotland, suppressing the Conservatives' vote share as well as eating into Labour's."" Its analysis continues: ""Despite losing 11 points in the constituency vote, this result would put the SNP just shy of a majority in Holyrood, mostly due to fragmentation in the other parties."" Remember, this is a snapshot, not a prediction. But it is fascinating nonetheless. The mood among SNP party members and senior figures at the conference was chipper and upbeat. The party feels competitive again and not only hopeful of victory next year, but even talking of that outright majority. Just winning again, with or without a majority, would be an extraordinary achievement. The party, if it does so, would he heading into its third consecutive decade in devolved power. A majority is a big ask, with an electoral system that makes securing one tricky. But it matters because the SNP's latest attempt to make an argument for another independence referendum rests on securing a majority. The party's logic goes like this: the last time they persuaded the government at Westminster to grant one, they had won a majority at Holyrood a few years before. That majority was won by Alex Salmond in 2011. The referendum followed in 2014. So, goes the current First Minister's logic, they need a majority again so they can point at that precedent from a decade and a half ago . PA Media Swinney is hoping to emulate the electoral success of Alex Salmond in 2011 The stumbling block is the UK government has made it clear, including in its manifesto, that it is opposed to another referendum. Privately, senior SNP folk ponder that if they do win a majority, and Labour lose power in the Senedd in Wales and do badly in local elections in many parts of England, Sir Keir Starmer might be out of Downing Street. There are a lot of ifs there and who knows. But even if Sir Keir was a goner, that manifesto would still be something Labour could point to. And the SNP would ask, again, just how voluntary the union of the United Kingdom really is if there is no achievable mechanism for another referendum. The SNP's critics point to what they see as a dismal domestic record, on the NHS, housing and the number of deaths among drug addicts, for instance. The party counters with its own riff on what it sees as its greatest hits – they had one for every stair between the ground and first floor of the conference centre. Free university tuition and free prescriptions are among them. But there is something else going on too. There is a near 50/50 split on the constitutional question in Scotland – independence or not. This is a nation split down the middle. This gives the SNP a deep well of potential support. It offers the opportunity to continue to defy what in other circumstances would likely be the undeniable gravity of longevity in office – plunging to defeat. Let's see. In local politics, politics in the nations and at the UK level, conventions continue to be upended in multiple directions. It is also true – and the SNP and its rivals know it – things can change quickly too.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4lz0789xo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72bd/live/94e688c0-a87d-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-13T22:13:01.429000+00:00,cb49da7b82d3cbee7cb789b06cee96d31ec5b7cf
e7048e01a044,"Prostate cancer screening urgently needed, says Rishi Sunak",,"Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has stepped up his call for a targeted screening programme for prostate cancer. In a BBC interview he said he was ""convinced of the urgency "" of introducing such a programme which would be affordable, deliverable and ""save countless lives"". His comments come as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its decision from five years ago not to recommend routine screening. Media reports suggest it may stick with its current stance. Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy, who has advanced prostate cancer, wants younger men to be checked. He wants the age threshold for requesting a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test lowered. Currently, it is not routinely offered to men without symptoms who are under 50. The PSA test is controversial though. Levels can rise for reasons other than cancer, such as infections, leading to false positives. Critics say this can result in unnecessary treatment and side effects. Sunak is an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research , which is publishing a report on the costs and benefits of a targeted screening programme. It would focus on men aged 45–69 with a family history of prostate cancer and black men, who face double the risk. This group includes around 1.3 million men in the UK. The charity estimates the programme would cost £25 million a year - or about £18 per patient - similar to bowel and breast cancer screening. It assumes 20% of eligible men would be invited annually, with a 72% uptake rate. Diagnostic activity (scans and biopsies) would need to rise by 23%, with only a modest increase in NHS staffing, it says. The benefits of introducing targeted screening for those at the highest risk outweigh the financial and logistical costs, according to the report authors. Speaking to the BBC, Sunak said: ""I've had family and friends that have been impacted by it – thankfully not lost their lives – but that partly has made me aware of why its so important we catch it early – the doctors are so brilliant now at treating you if you catch it early."" He said men, including himself, were often shy of coming forward to discuss health issues: ""That's why a proactive targeted screening programme could make a difference in helping save lives."" The screening programme backed by the Prostate Cancer Research Charity would involve an MRI scan as well as the PSA test and then a biopsy. Asked whether he might have done more while in Downing Street to push the case for prostate cancer screening, Sunak said testing had now become more reliable: ""The thing that has changed is use of MRI scans so we can now much more effectively and safely target the people who most need our help - the moment is now – its deliverable and affordable"". But some medical experts are sceptical about the value of screening. They argue there is still a risk that patients will be treated for the cancer when it is not strictly necessary and will then have to live with side effects such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Professor Hashim Ahmed, Chair of Urology at Imperial College, says more research is needed to determine the potential value of screening. ""The problem is we can often find disease that doesn't need to be treated and we end up causing harm...and my concern at the moment is that harm to benefit equation isn't quite right."" The National Screening Committee will have to weigh up the evidence and arguments. While the new report by Prostate Cancer Research says the implications for staffing and availability of a screening programme would be manageable, others have argued that it would take scanning capacity away from patients being treated for other conditions. Patient voices are also shaping the debate. On a recent visit to a prostate cancer clinic at Guy's Hospital in London, Sunak met David Bateman who is 66. After asking for a PSA test he was diagnosed with the cancer at the age of 59 and was told it had spread to his pelvis. He has since been given chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment but cannot be cured. David supports screening for those who are potentially vulnerable. ""That is very important to me because of my sons – they are 38 and 40 – I want them checked as soon as possible. If I had been screened at 50 I am sure I wouldn't be in the position I am today,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwykxqerk12o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c1f2/live/55ace660-a82b-11f0-9f09-57500e5dbf06.jpg,2025-10-14T05:01:05.278000+00:00,13d13d49fdc1a860faedf7be60a40d9a1d2b7c53
c3ee7cf08bd4,The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explained,,"The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explained AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spies The government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead. In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame. The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact. What was the case about? Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Why did it collapse? Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government ""over many months"" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute. He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a ""threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences. However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution. What was the political fallout? Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place. He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a ""threat to national security"". Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument. Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat. However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence. The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions. Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case. Why is this a problem for the government? Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because ""the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing"" - something it has denied. Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy. Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year. The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests. However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been ""too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq057734w1o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d716/live/191e2800-a842-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T14:42:49.030000+00:00,bbc386e0fc55228a95ae0f887fbe343d2c350c26
ce6ecc1053fb,Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees freed as Trump hails 'historic dawn' in Middle East,,"Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees freed as Trump hails 'historic dawn' in Middle East 'Peace in the Middle East': Trump signs ceasefire deal in Egypt Israelis and Palestinians have celebrated as a major hostage and prisoner exchange on Monday marked a significant step towards ending two years of war in Gaza. In a crucial first phase of the US-brokered plan to end the war, Hamas returned all living Israeli hostages, while Israel freed almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. There were emotional scenes as families of the Israeli hostages screamed and cried with happiness as they embraced their freed loved ones. And for the Palestinians who were freed from Israeli jails, crowds waving flags greeted them joyfully as they arrived on buses in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. US President Donald Trump landed in Israel minutes after the first hostages were reunited with their families, and in a speech to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, declared a ""historic dawn in a new Middle East"". He then flew on to a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to meet more than 20  leaders for talks on later phases of his Gaza peace plan. At the summit Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the US signed a declaration as guarantors of the ceasefire deal which is aimed at ending two years of war that has left Gaza in ruins. But amid the diplomatic celebrations and the joy of reunions between family members, many challenges still lie ahead if the ceasefire is to be built into a lasting peace. The latter phases of Trump's 20-point peace plan are fraught with sticking points, and intense negotiations will be needed in order to move forward. Monday's hostage and prisoner exchange completed the initial phase of the deal - and came after a ceasefire took effect on Friday and an increase of humanitarian aid entered Gaza over the weekend. ""I am overwhelmed with emotion and joy,"" said Arbel Yehoud, a former hostage herself who was reunited with her partner Ariel Cunio when he was released on Monday. ""For over two years, the hope of holding Ariel again is what sustained and drove me every single day,"" she said. Though the releases went largely as planned, Israel's hostage families expressed outrage that Hamas said it would only return the bodies of four of the deceased hostages. The Israeli military said it would carry out forensic tests before confirming their identities and informing their families. It is thought the remains of up to 24 others hostages remain in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement, published by Israeli media, appears to have acknowledged that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate where all the remains are within the timeframe given. Watch: Emotional reunions as freed hostages return to Israel As part of the agreement, around 1,700 Palestinian detainees who had been held by Israel without charge were freed. One Palestinian woman reunited with her son said her heart was finally at peace. ""Honestly, the happiness and joy is indescribable, despite the suffering... today we came to celebrate,"" a Palestinian man said. About 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences were also released by Israel, with about 100 being freed into the occupied West Bank . Others were deported and a small number released into East Jerusalem. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they were still met by raucous cheers - but many looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk. ""There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow,"" said Khalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous, who gathered outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to collect his son who he said had been detained by Israel for about three months. Watch: Palestinian prisoners released in West Bank to rapturous crowds After being greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump visited the Knesset, where he conducted the first address by a US president since 2008 . ""At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,"" he told the chamber during a long address, with some politicians' breaking out into chants of ""Trump, Trump, Trump"". There was a brief interruption, when an opposition member held up a piece of paper that said ""Recognise Palestine"". Trump then flew onto Sharm El-Sheikh where he met more than 20 world leaders - including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the leaders of many Muslim and Arab countries. He posed for photos along with other leaders on a stage emblazoned with the words ""Peace in the Middle East"". Among those also in attendance was former UK prime minister Tony Blair, who - under Trump's plan - is slated to play a key role in a ""Board of Peace"" for Gaza that would be headed and chaired by the US President. Getty Images The plan would see Gaza initially governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats overseen by the ""Board of Peace"", before power is eventually transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) once it has undergone reforms. But difficult negotiations will be needed in order to move forward with the latter phases of the plan. Among the points of contention are the extent and timeline of Israeli troop withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas, and the future governance of the Gaza Strip. Hamas has previously said it would not disarm unless a Palestinian state was established - and has rejected the idea of foreign governance in Gaza. Netanyahu has pushed back on any future involvement of the PA. Asked when phase two of negotiations on a peace agreement will begin, Trump replied: ""It's started"". ""The phases are all a little bit mixed in with each other,"" he added. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw 1,200 people killed and 251 others taken hostage back to Gaza. Since then more than 67,000 people have been killed by Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies. More than 9 in 10 residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed according to the UN.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740jx07vz0o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18f7/live/f0d48700-a877-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T20:57:45.017000+00:00,c058c474d5791c75c43249b7f5e3ba981747bccd

""You're my life,"" she exclaims, hugging him tightly in footage filmed by the Israeli military. ""My life. My hero. Come, come."" Matan was one of 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza after being taken during the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, who were freed on Monday after two years in captivity. His mother, Einav, has campaigned fiercely for Matan's return. She became among the best-known faces of the movement, and demanded the Israeli government agree a hostage exchange with Hamas. Last week, she and her daughter lit fireworks in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv to celebrate the ceasefire deal that had been agreed between Israel and Hamas as part of Donald Trump's peace plan. On Monday, crowds gathered and cheered in the same square as they watched footage on big screens of Matan and the other 19 freed hostages returning to Israel and reuniting with their families. People waved the Israeli and US flags and held up photos of the hostages and signs saying ""they're coming home"". Matan was taken with his partner Ilana Gritzewsky from Nir Oz, but Ilana was released during a ceasefire the following month. In December 2024, Hamas released a video showing Matan in captivity in which he said he and his fellow hostages were suffering from skin ailments and shortages of food, water and medicine. Israel Defense Forces Released Israeli hostage, Matan Zanguaker, greets his mother in a video clip shared by the IDF In a video call with Matan on Monday shortly after his release, Einav told him: ""Thank God, the war is over. The war is over."" In a later statement, the family said that ""after two years of hell, today we begin a new chapter of our lives - one of healing and rehabilitation"". That sentiment was shared by several of the families who were reunited with their loved ones. The family of Eitan Horn, who was also taken from Nir Oz, and whose brother Yair was released during a ceasefire in February, said they would have ""hugs and lots of love and we will accompany him through the entire recovery process"". Reuters Relatives of Israeli hostage Eitan Horn pictured as they awaited his release Relatives of 24-year-old Evyatar David, who was taken from the Nova music festival and was seen emaciated in a tunnel in a video published by Hamas in August, said they always ""knew he would return"". ""After two years of suffering, he is here. Now a new journey of healing will begin for Evyatar and us,"" they said in a statement. Reuters Released hostage Evyatar David grins as he arrives at a medical centre in the outskirts of Tel Aviv The living hostages were collected from meeting points in Gaza by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has acted as a neutral intermediary in the handovers. They were then reunited with loved ones at reception points near the Gaza border, before being airlifted to hospitals to begin the process of physical and psychological treatment. Reuters Matan stands with his mother and waves as he arrives at a medical centre in Tel Aviv by helicopter There were celebrations across Israel as the 20 hostages returned. People waved at the sky and cheered when they were flown overhead in military helicopters on their way to hospitals. Inbar Goldstein, whose own relatives were released in the November 2023 ceasefire, told the BBC she was feeling ""happy and thankful"". ""I know that sad days are still ahead but I want to separate between what I know and what I feel,"" she said. Elsewhere in the square, teenager Yarden told the BBC: ""We're here for the hostages, their release and to celebrate them. Today all Israelis are together - it's not about left or right, it's about all being together to celebrate the hostages."" EPA Israelis celebrated in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv But while the living hostages have now been returned, many families of those killed in captivity are still waiting, with Hamas saying only four bodies out of 28 would be released on Monday. The Israeli military said it would carry out forensic tests before confirming their identities and informing their families. A copy of the ceasefire agreement published by Israeli media had stated that the remains of all of the deceased hostages should be handed over by 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday. However, it also appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of them within that timeframe. The deal also involved the release of about 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged Hamas to ""uphold its end of the deal"" by returning all of the bodies. Matan's family said there could be no closure until this happened.

9de64250d9c3,Madagascar president hiding in 'safe place' as he warns of coup attempt,,"Madagascar's embattled President Andry Rajoelina has said he is sheltering in a ""safe place"" after an attempt on his life, following weeks of protests calling for him to quit. In a live broadcast to the nation on Facebook, Rajoelina, 51, said ""a group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me"". He did not reveal his location, but unconfirmed reports earlier suggested that he had fled the country on a French military aircraft. It follows a fortnight of nationwide protests, mainly led by young demonstrators, aimed at kicking him out of power. Rajoelina's failed attempts to placate the young protesters - dubbed ""Gen Z Mada"" - saw the president sack his entire government and make other concessions to no avail. He has not been seen since Wednesday, and at the weekend Rajoelina's office said an attempt was under way to force him from power. His address to the nation was delayed several times on Monday amid the chaos, as soldiers threatened to seize the state TV headquarters in the Indian Ocean island. Eventually, in the Facebook broadcast he said: ""Since 25 September, there have been attempts on my life and coup attempts. A group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me. ""I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life."" ""There is only one way to resolve these issues; that is to respect the constitution in force in the country"". Over the weekend, CAPSAT, a powerful army unit that helped install Rajoelina into power in 2009 moved to undermine him by declaring itself in command of all the armed forces, while some of its officers joined protesters on the streets of the capital, Antananarivo. Following a meeting of military commanders on Monday, the new Chief of Army Staff installed by CAPSAT, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, assured the public that the security forces were working together to maintain order in the island nation. By Monday evening, the general was at state TV headquarters trying to resolve the crisis, according to a statement from the presidency. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior leader in Madagascar's largest opposition party, TIM, told the BBC that Madagascar was now effectively being run by the army unit. The TIM party has also said that it plans to bring impeachment proceedings against Rajoelina for ""abandonment of post"". France's President Emmanuel Macron refused on Monday to confirm Rajoelina had been evacuated by a French military aircraft. However, he said the  ""constitutional order"" must be preserved in Madagascar. ""We have a youth that has expressed itself, that is politicised, that wants to live better and that is a very good thing,"" Macron told reporters in Egypt. ""We just need to make sure that it is not taken over by military factions or foreign interference."" The head of the African Union's security council expressed similar concerns, saying the organisation firmly rejected any ""unconstitutional change of government"". Several of Rajoelina's inner circle have fled to nearby Mauritius. They include former Prime Minister Christian Ntsay and the businessman Maminiaina Ravatomanga. Despite its abundant natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. About 75% of people there live below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows just over one-third of people have access to electricity. The protests began over anger with repeated water and power cuts, then escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption and the cost-of-living crisis. At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the first few days of the protests, according to the UN, although the government has rejected these figures. Eyewitnesses describe security officers opening fire on protesters with live ammunition. In one case, a newborn baby died from smoke inhalation after being exposed to tear gas. Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina ushered into office. Aged just 34 at the time, Rajoelina became Africa's youngest leader - going on to govern for four years, then returning to power again after the 2018 election. Rajoelina was born into wealth and, before entering politics, had made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and DJ - setting up a radio station and an advertising company along the way. But his sharp-suited, baby-faced appeal soon waned, as allegations of cronyism and entrenched corruption became unshakeable.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzyek0jxro,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a210/live/e796d890-a878-11f0-8d21-ad9b41c65325.jpg,2025-10-14T07:47:44.819000+00:00,10871c72ee3aa93cb0aceb449b5fdd2c320b37e1
8a0f1b4826e8,'Your appointment's rescheduled': Shutdown cancels US citizenship ceremonies,,"About a dozen of us walked into a US immigration office in Virginia on Saturday morning, people born all over the world excited to take the final step in becoming American citizens. We clutched our naturalisation notices as we filed through security and lined up at the check-in desk. Soon, we would raise our right hands and swear the Oath of Allegiance to the United States in a ceremony that is known as both solemn and celebratory. Carrying small American flags, we would walk out citizens. But then, abruptly, we learned the ceremony had been cancelled because of the government shutdown. ""You should have been notified,"" said the staff member at the desk. None of us had received any emails or phone calls. The staff at the entrance had let us in without warning, raising the possibility that they too had not been notified. Later, when I checked the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website, it was temporarily down. When it came back online, I saw my appointment had been cancelled days earlier ""due to unforeseen circumstances."" If you hadn't checked the website yourself, you would never have known. ""We regret any inconvenience this may cause,"" the notice said. Around me at the office, disappointment quickly turned into confusion. One woman in a hijab quietly asked if I had been turned away too, worried it might have been because of her clothing. A man had gathered his family to celebrate his final step to becoming a US citizen, only to leave anxious and uncertain. A few people seemed genuinely frightened, wondering how the delay might affect their work, lives and plans. This was more than an inconvenience. Some of us had spent years plodding through paperwork and interviews, as well as preparing for the citizenship test.  After more than a decade of having a green card, I had decided to become a citizen and vote. All of us now were stuck in limbo. At the office, we were told to come back on 1 November. With the ongoing federal shutdown, though, there's a chance that could slip. The immigration service is largely funded by application fees and so it typically stays open during a government shutdown. But its director, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on X that public-facing services such as interviews and naturalisation ceremonies can be delayed. He added that the agency ""regrets any negative impacts but must ensure it complies with the law"". It's unclear how many USCIS appointments or oath ceremonies have been cancelled nationwide. The service lists field office closures on a web page, but it does not provide totals for cancelled ceremonies.  Anecdotal reports have circulated online about other oath ceremonies that have been scrapped. What's also unclear is when the government will reopen. Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since 1 October, leading to a shutdown that has placed more than 700,000 federal workers on unpaid leave. Add on the many rapid changes made to US immigration policies in the last nine months, and the anxiety among those of us working to become American citizens can only rise. The effects of a Washington stalemate are rippling into the everyday lives - and possibly futures - of those of us hoping to call the US our permanent home.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgywnjkrlqo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/27c7/live/1a67b4a0-a866-11f0-978b-27d7703329f1.jpg,2025-10-13T19:18:51.889000+00:00,420c83487195585e76efdb6f4384359d09aa128e
553b517f40dd,Indonesian MPs get extra allowance weeks after angry protests over perks,,"Weeks after widespread protests swept Indonesia over the excessive pays of lawmakers, a new allowance raise has unleashed fresh public anger. Lawmakers will now get 702 million rupiah ($42,400; £31,800) in recess allowances - a near-double increase from the previous allowance of 400 million rupiah, said the country's deputy house speaker. The recess allowance is meant to support lawmakers carrying out their official duties, like visiting constituents, when parliament is not in session. The protests earlier in August were triggered primarily by a $3,000 monthly housing allowances given to lawmakers - nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta. These were later cut, in a bid to quell anger. August's protests began after thousands demonstrated against the housing allowances for MPs. But they soon spilled into a wider protest over corruption and economic inequality in South East Asia's largest economy. And now, news of the latest recess allowance hike - which kicked in on 3 October - has renewed controversy around this. Indonesian lawmakers take around five recesses a year, during which they visit their electoral districts and gather feedback from residents. The hike in recess allowances is meant to match the increased activities by lawmakers during their recesses, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad told reporters on Saturday. He told Reuters that the previous allowance did not take into account the rise in food and transport prices. Dasco also said on Monday that the House of Representatives would release a publicly accessible app where lawmakers are required to report on their expenditure of recess funds, to allow Indonesians to monitor their spending. It is not unheard of for lawmakers in other countries to receive allowances on top of their basic salaries to cover their official duties to their constituents. In Australia, the electorate allowance ranges from $25,000 to $37,000 per year depending on the size of the lawmaker's constituency. The latest incident is part of a growing anger over what many Indonesians perceive to be the impunity of the country's political elite. ""It's like Indonesians have been pranked,"" Lucius Karus from Formappi, a non-profit parliamentary watchdog, told local media outlets. ""We were satisfied by the abolition of the housing allowance … but, in fact, another fantastic allowance has appeared."" Part of this anger also stems from reports that a number of lawmakers had received an extra 54 million rupiah in recess allowance. Authorities later said this was due to human error and that the money had been clawed back. ""[The government's] behavior is not surprising,"" wrote another X user. ""What is surprising is why the Indonesian people still want to choose them.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4gwr20wzo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7595/live/3f9f76c0-a8a9-11f0-b460-7943db59aa66.jpg,2025-10-14T04:44:13.188000+00:00,6b4d6fa44c47188c2cb2b64a2b67cdd775170a00
b68f2fa3fbfb,Eurovision organisers postpone vote on Israel's inclusion in contest next year,,"The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have postponed a vote on whether Israel should be allowed to perform in next year's competition. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said ""recent developments in the Middle East"" had prompted it to cancel the virtual meeting to vote on the matter, which was scheduled to take place in November. It said Israel's participation would instead be discussed at an in-person meeting in December, though it did not make clear whether a vote would still take place. Israel's participation in Eurovision has faced opposition from some other participating countries due to the war in Gaza. On Monday, all 20 living Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. It comes after a ceasefire came into force on Friday. In a statement, the EBU said: ""In the light of recent developments in the Middle East, the EBU's executive board (meeting on October 13) agreed there was a clear need to organise an open and in-person discussion among its members on the issue of participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026."" ""Consequently, the board agreed to put the issue on the agenda of its ordinary winter general assembly, which will be taking place in December, rather than organising an extraordinary session in advance,"" it added. The EBU announced last month it would invite 68 member countries to give their view on whether Israel should take part at a general assembly meeting in November. Austrian national broadcaster ORF, which will host the contest in 2026, said it welcomed the EBU's decision. It had previously urged countries not to boycott the contest next year in Vienna, with its Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger saying Eurovision and the arts in general are ""not the appropriate arenas for sanctions"". Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Iceland and the Netherlands have all said they would consider boycotting next year's contest if Israel were to take part. Dutch broadcaster AvroTros said last month it would not change its position if a ceasefire in Gaza was reached. ""If a ceasefire is reached in the near future or the conflict develops differently, that will not change our position for 2026. We will reassess participation in subsequent years, depending on the circumstances at that time,"" it said in a statement. The BBC has asked Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, for comment. In September it said it should be allowed to take part, saying it was ""one of the contest's longstanding, popular and successful participants"". Israel came second in the the most recent Eurovision Song Contest in May, with its act Yuval Raphael receiving the largest combined public vote.

dc596be0829a,Venezuela shuts embassy in Norway following opposition leader's Nobel award,,"Venezuela announced on Monday it would close its embassy in Oslo, days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In a statement, the Venezuelan government did not comment on Machado's prize, saying that the closure was part of a restructuring of its foreign service. Norway's foreign ministry confirmed that Caracas had closed its embassy in Oslo without providing a reason. The Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded her the prize on Friday in recognition of what it called ""her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela"", while Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro referred to the 58-year-old laureate as a ""demonic witch"". The Norwegian foreign ministry called the decision ""regrettable"". ""Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction,"" a ministry spokeswoman said. She added that the Nobel Prize ""is independent of the Norwegian government"". Machado has for years been campaigning against Maduro, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many nations as illegitimate. She has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year. In honouring her achievement, Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes called Machado a ""key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis."" Machado told BBC Mundo her award was ""like an injection"" for her political movement. ""It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,"" she said. Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening new outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it called ""strategic partners in the fight"" against ""hegemonic pressures"". Venezuela's closure of embassies in two close US allies comes after weeks of heightened tension between Caracas and Washington. The US military has destroyed at least four boats that it said were carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 21 people on board, in what the Trump administration calls a war on drugs. The strikes have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.

Candi Hulley, 52, from Bude, Cornwall, said a chance check-up at her dentist had led to her diagnosis. The Mouth Cancer Foundation charity said more than 3,000 people died of mouth cancer last year nationally – a 20% rise over the past five years. It said it wanted the public to know it was not just dentists who could check for mouth cancer and ""if you're unsure, go and see your doctor, or a pharmacist"". Veins and an artery from her leg were used to reconstruct nearly half of her tongue ""My children call this my shark bite,"" Ms Hulley said as she displayed the back of her calf where surgeons removed veins and an artery to reconstruct nearly half of her tongue. It took a team more than 12 hours to remove the tumour from her mouth to ensure she would be able to eat, speak and swallow again. She said: ""The plastic surgeon described it as like magic... I've had a few operations but that was pretty much the scariest thing I've ever been through."" Now she said she was urging people to check themselves for the warning signs. She said: ""I was lucky, it would have spread if it hadn't been monitored"". Ms Hulley spent a month in hospital after an operation to remove her mouth cancer Ms Hulley said the recovery had been almost as intensive as the surgery, with a month spent in hospital and another six months before she could return to work. She said: ""I had speech therapists and nutritionists because I was on a feeding tube for so long – I lost loads of weight. ""Then you have to try and eat. That's scary, you can choke."" The Mouth Cancer Foundation said it believed awareness around the disease was low. ""We have figures that suggest only about 17% of the UK population is aware of mouth cancer,"" said dental hygienist Alison Brown from the charity. ""And it [treatment and recovery] can be particularly unpleasant – it can involve dissection of the tongue, people lose teeth, they have to learn to speak and eat again."" Alison Brown, from the Mouth Cancer Foundation, said she was concerned about lack of awareness of the disease Dental students in the south-west of England are among those being taught to check for the signs of mouth cancer. Fourth-year student Isabelle Adams, who is studying at the Peninsula Dental School in Truro, said such teaching was ""so important"".

f411d3b6185f,"Eat kiwi fruit to relieve constipation, says guidance",,"Eating several kiwi fruit a day can help relieve constipation and is a better starting point than worrying about a high-fibre diet, according to new guidance for doctors on the condition. The advice says drinking water high in minerals is better for constipation than tap water, and magnesium oxide supplements are good for improving symptoms. Researchers from King's College London, who produced the guidance by examining all available evidence, said there are many more options for getting things moving than the standard advice to ""just have more fibre in your diet"". Constipation that doesn't go away affects one in 10 people and can have a major impact on someone's quality of life. You are constipated if you haven't had a bowel motion (poo) at least three times during the last week, or you're going less often than usual, says the NHS. Straining on the loo or feeling like you haven't fully emptied your bowels may also be signs of constipation - but these aren't the only ones. ""People can report up to 30 different symptoms of constipation,"" says Dr Eirini Dimidi, lead study author and reader in nutritional sciences at King's College London (KCL). The new guidance suggests the best remedy is to focus on fruit and drinks first, rather than worrying about the latest probiotic in the supermarket or packing your diet full of different kinds of fibre, she says. Dr Dimidi recommends eating two or three kiwis throughout the day or 8-10 prunes to improve constipation. Skin on or skin off the kiwi? ""Even without the skin, it's good and contains fibre,"" she explains, but adds there's no harm keeping the skin on either. The fibre in kiwi fruit affects the gut in a way which increases the volume of stool, which can also induce contractions in the bowel. ""Kiwi also increases water content into the gut which may soften stools,"" Dr Dimidi says. Snacking on 8-10 prunes a day and some rye bread can also have a similar effect. Mineral water ""is better than tap water"" to drink, she says, although bottled water in the UK is lower in minerals than water available elsewhere, such as eastern Europe. The crucial mineral is magnesium, which has a laxative effect. And that's why taking magnesium oxide supplements was found to have lots of benefits, according to the research. These included reducing lower tummy pain, bloating, straining - and making it easier to poo. Regarding probiotics, the guidelines suggest some types can improve some symptoms but there is also a lack of research on the impact of many different probiotic strains. Up until now, guidance for doctors treating patients with constipation has been limited and outdated, and focused on advice to increase dietary fibre and water intake, say the researchers. The new recommendations are based on evidence from 75 clinical trials - all those available - which have been analysed by a panel of experts. Prof Kevin Whelan, senior research author and professor of dietetics at KCL, said the new guidance ""marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet"". He said this meant people suffering from constipation could now access up-to-date advice to help improve their symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life. The British Dietetic Association, which funded the project to produce the new guidelines, said they were an excellent resource for dietitians, doctors and nurses, and supported ""a more diet-focused and evidence-based approach to the management of chronic constipation"". The research and the new guidelines are published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kdkxy3veo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d23e/live/d40d3da0-a846-11f0-8df8-17b411cc599c.jpg,2025-10-13T16:24:03.156000+00:00,39ba7bdfde63fcab4ff7f282bef481b30816cb88
b0af9161ff9b,Could I have saved my parents if I'd been taught CPR?,,"Could I have saved my parents if I'd been taught CPR? Jonathan Geddes Glasgow and west reporter and Hayley Jarvis BBC Cameron McGerr believes CPR should be taught in all schools Cameron McGerr should have been with his parents to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary last month. Instead, Lynne and Kevin McGerr's 16-year-old son stood in front of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament and revealed he had lost both to heart conditions. He believes he might have been able to help at least one of his parents in their moment of crisis if he had been taught life-saving CPR skills at a younger age. Having already persuaded his school in Inverclyde to introduce the first aid training, he now wants to see it introduced to schools across Scotland. Cameron's dad Kevin died from a cardiac arrest in February this year. It came three years after Lynne suffered a fatal heart attack. The couple had been married since 30 September 1995. ""After my dad died I kind of thought maybe I should do something about this,"" said Cameron, a pupil at Clydeview Academy in Gourock. ""The first time I kind of thought it was bad luck but the second time I thought 'well I was 15, I really should have been able to know what to do'."" McGerr Family Lynne and Kevin McGerr on their wedding day in 1995 Now Cameron and his classmates are learning how to give CPR  - a potentially life-saving treatment using chest compressions to restart a person's heartbeat. He hopes more schools across Scotland will soon do the same and adopt his campaign, which is called Pulse of Life. ""It could be your mum, it could be your dad, it could be your sister or it could be a friend, neighbour, stranger,"" said Cameron, who now lives with his aunt. ""The truth is it can happen to anyone at any time. I think that's what a lot of people don't realise, and I think that's why everyone needs to be fully equipped to be able to step in and do it."" Scottish Parliament Cameron addressed the Scottish Parliament in September When Cameron spoke to MSPs at Holyrood last month , he estimated that when his dad collapsed he lost about two and a half minutes of time panicking about what to do. He said: ""I believe that if I had known CPR, I would have been able to save my dad. I would have been more confident while performing CPR, worrying less as his ribs broke under the force of my hands. ""I would not have had to wait for the 999 operator to instruct me in what to do. In my panic, I lost probably two and a half minutes, which instantly decreased his chance of survival by 25%."" Cameron's head teacher Craig Gibson said the teenager had shown outstanding resilience after the deaths of his parents. British Heart Foundation figures suggest around 3,800 people experience a cardiac arrest out of hospital in Scotland each year – with a survival rate of one in 10. Health groups and medical charities believe that number could improve if more people felt confident about performing CPR , and were able to take action quickly. ""I'm not doing it for me and I'm not doing it to try and prove the point - I'm doing it because I know it will make a difference"" says Cameron of the campaign. Clydeview pupils and staff have responded with enthusiasm to the CPR lessons, saying it has given them confidence about performing it if needed. Craig Gibson, the headteacher at Clydeview, told BBC Scotland News that Cameron had shown ""outstanding resilience in the face of such tragedy"" over the past three years. ""Cameron and I have met a number of times and he's spoken to me quite openly about the impact of the loss that's had on him, but more importantly the changes that he would like to make,"" says Craig. The school is hopeful all current S1 pupils will be taught CPR by the end of the current academic year. The teaching model will then be shared with other secondary schools throughout the region. However, Cameron has already seen his campaign go further afield, leading to his appearance at the Scottish Parliament. It came on the day of what would have been his parents' wedding anniversary. Despite his nerves, he movingly recalled waking up to his dad screaming, unsure of what to do after his mum's heart attack. ""I wonder whether, if I had been given CPR training , I would have been able to step in and make a difference. ""However, I cannot live life wondering 'what if?'. I need to live to make a difference for other people who might encounter the same problem."" Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has now written to Cameron offering to meet him. A Scottish government spokesperson said it would continue to work with partners to make sure pupils have the opportunity to learn CPR, with many schools already doing so. McGerr Family Cameron thinks his parents would be proud of the campaign he has launched in their memory However far his campaign goes, and whatever difference it makes, Cameron is sure of one thing - that his parents would be proud of what he's doing. ""I think they'd be a bit, not caught off guard, but a bit shocked because here's this shy boy that didn't like confrontation, didn't like public speaking, who just went and addressed the country's parliament. ""They would be immensely  proud, and I knew that even before I'd done this.

61be86b9de90,'Heart-in-mouth' Belgium loss leaves Wales facing play-off challenge,,"Wales' players were crestfallen at the final whistle, glazed looks in their eyes as it dawned on them that a huge opportunity had slipped through their grasp. Belgium's goalless draw with North Macedonia on Friday had opened the door for Wales, who needed to win their remaining three games to finish top of Group J and qualify automatically for the World Cup. But they fell at the first hurdle, outgunned by Belgium in another chaotic shootout after losing 4-3 in Brussels in June. Again, Wales' bold approach - to press and to pour forward at every opportunity - left them exposed defensively, and once again they were ruthlessly punished by Jeremy Doku, Kevin de Bruyne and the rest. On reflection, did Bellamy feel his side were just a little too open? ""We felt the best way of being able to combat this team was to have the ball,"" he answered. ""And we created a lot of chances, but we felt that was the way of being able to beat this team because we needed to win. ""It was as simple as that, and you could see even towards the end, we opened up more. We lost a bit of control in the game. But I always believe the way you can stop the opposition from scoring is by having the ball. ""But that transition moment, with Jeremy, it's so fearful every time you have the ball that if it turns over, this kid, he's just that. ""I've experienced it. I had him on my team [at Anderlecht], and I knew how dangerous he was, but going against him... We knew there were going to be difficult moments in that game."" This has been a bruising window for Bellamy, whose decision to take on England in a friendly at Wembley last Thursday was met with a mixture of scepticism, bemusement and outright criticism. The outcome, a chastening 3-0 defeat, intensified the fans' discontent, though they were willing to keep an open mind if it helped Wales beat Belgium. Supporters will be less forgiving now Wales have lost - making it 12 goals conceded in five games - and seen their hopes of qualifying automatically go up in smoke. But nothing will deter Bellamy, who is unshakeable in his beliefs. ""I've seen a lot today that makes me feel we can get close to these. We can get close. We need to keep improving,"" he said. ""But I told you at the start when I was going to do this. I'm going to press, and I won't sit back. I know that goes against some people, but this is who I am. ""And today, I've seen a team with flaws because I have them. A team that wants to do something, because I want to. I'm grateful for that.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr4305p402xo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/39df/live/f95bf2e0-a878-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-13T22:51:11.855000+00:00,0733074ebb35b8cb8eb1d68299f4b0651147a8f7
25726312b3e8,England's striking dilemma - how would you rank Tuchel's options?,,"Thank goodness for Harry Kane. The Bayern Munich star is likely to start England's match in Riga against Latvia on Tuesday night where he will be hoping to add to his superb run of 18 goals from his past 10 matches. A minor injury meant Kane was not involved in England's 3-0 win over Wales on Thursday night with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins - the only other out-and-out striker in the squad - deputising. But during the match Watkins collided with the post and has subsequently been ruled out of the Latvia fixture through injury. England fans are once again going through who the striker options behind captain Kane and the answer does not appear obvious. Remarkably, only seven English players you would class as an out-and-out striker have appeared in the Premier League this season - with Chelsea's Liam Delap the only one of the seven under the age of 26. The other six are Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Eddie Nketiah, Dominic Solanke, Watkins, Danny Welbeck and Callum Wilson. England's lack of options in the centre-forward position was even noted by Under-21s manager Lee Carsley, who said on Monday: ""We need more centre forwards, we need more orthodox number nines which are capable of scoring goals.

Littler came into the tournament in Wigan on the back of his 6-1 demolition of world number one Luke Humphries in the World Grand Prix final on Sunday. The 18-year-old had breezed through his three matches in the round-robin phase of the event, with wins over Dutchman Jeffrey Keen, Iceland's Alexander Thorvaldsson and Belgium's Matthias Moors. However, the world champion nearly exited the tournament at the hands of fellow Englishman Charlie Manby in the last 16. Littler was on the brink of defeat at 5-3 down to the 20-year-old, before fighting back to clinch a gritty victory. Warrington teenager Littler found himself 2-1 down in the semi-final against Greaves and responded by winning three consecutive legs to seize the upper hand. But three-time WDF women's world champion Greaves - who is set to accept a PDC Tour card for 2026-27 - rallied to level the match at 4-4 and 5-5. Greaves then blew Littler away in the decider as she threw an 11-dart leg - the 21-year-old from Doncaster sealing victory with a checkout of 84. She will meet defending champion Gian van Veen in next month's final after the Dutchman, 23, clinched a 6-4 win over Sebastian Bialecki of Poland in the other semi-final. The World Youth Championship final will be played on 23 November in Minehead, before the Players Championship final on the same day. Littler, who averaged 107.4 to Greaves' 105, posted on Instagram after his defeat: ""Fair play to Beau. All the best in Minehead. Some talent.""

f3dfd5704837,How Bright left her mark on historic Lionesses,,"Bright's grasp on an England starring role began when she played in five of their six matches at the 2019 World Cup en route to the semi-finals. She was sent off after receiving a second yellow card in the semi-final defeat by the United States - a game which hinted at future success for England, albeit one that ended on a sour note for Bright personally. As a mainstay under former manager Phil Neville, Bright was among those who had started to steer England towards a major tournament final, but had just come up short, as interest in the women's game was slowly increasing. They were a long way off selling out crowds at Wembley Stadium and were still battling for basic resources at club level but had formed one of the teams who were starting to ask questions of the all-conquering United States. However, it was in 2022 when Bright cemented her place in Lionesses history and had her biggest year for her country. Alongside captain Williamson, they formed an impenetrable partnership at the Euros, leading from the back and guiding a youthful, yet talented England team to success. She was undoubtedly one of the stars despite not dominating the headlines in the way Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead or Mary Earps did. A towering presence, who usually came out on top in a one-on-one duel, Bright was often Wiegman's go-to person off the pitch, and she even did a job up front on occasions when it was needed on it - most notably finishing joint-top scorer at the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup in 2022, sharing the Golden Boot award with then-Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas. As the vice-captain, she was vocal in the dressing room, an important part of Wiegman's leadership group and someone young players often turned to for advice. She was seen as one of the jokers of the group, usually found stood near best friend Rachel Daly or midway through a TikTok dance with Mary Earps. In the aftermath of England's Euro 2022 victory, she became a familiar name among casual viewers and carried the weight of responsibility going into the 2023 World Cup in Williamson's absence, knowing external expectation had grown tenfold. Off the pitch she became a fierce advocate for mental health support and was among those who played a key part in the Lionesses' call for equal access for girls football in schools following their Euro 2022 success.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c14pzpmyl71o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/36a7/live/93431a20-a84a-11f0-8df8-17b411cc599c.jpg,2025-10-13T18:23:53.798000+00:00,2a7ad05522411e7d4e07347484f9b1ce4b1aebc8

""Having looked at the stats, ironically Germany played more long balls than us in the game,"" he said. For his part, Julian Nagelsmann, whose comments after the reverse fixture in Cologne prompted O'Neill's quip, was relieved to get through a ""tough"" game. ""The second half was all about defending,"" Nagelsmann told BBC Sport. ""As I said before the game it was a really tough opponent, a lot of long balls and they fight and we had to fight as well. ""It was a good step in the right direction to beat a team like Northern Ireland and to fight for second balls and be as tough as the opponent."" Top spot in Group A is now a long shot given Germany have put their grasp on automatic qualification. But second place and a guaranteed play-off is still on the cards ahead of November's two qualifiers in Slovakia and home to bottom side Luxembourg. It may not be much consolation now, but a play-off as one of four Nations League group winners seems to be a more secure fall back given other results across Europe, if Northern Ireland were to miss out on the top two.

In January, manager Ruben Amorim criticised Rashford for not showing the attitude of someone ""giving the maximum every day"".

9a74f3abac92,Is Russell's 'outstanding season' being overlooked?,,"With all the talk of Max Verstappen's highly impressive season, is the job George Russell is doing in the Mercedes being overlooked? Given the correct equipment, does he look a world champion in the making? - Matt George Russell has driven an outstanding season, including dominant wins in Canada and Singapore. There has never been any doubt about Russell's speed - his qualifying lap at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, when he put a Williams on the front row in the wet, should arguably be considered one of the greatest of all time. But a couple of years ago there were questions as to whether he was a little error-prone in high-stress situations. Last year's Canadian Grand Prix, when everyone felt the Mercedes was the fastest car, but Russell made a couple of mistakes that allowed Max Verstappen to sneak in for the win, was a case in point. In fact, there was an episode of the Netflix Drive to Survive series covering 2024 dedicated to the question of whether Russell was demonstrating team leadership qualities. It was, it has to be said, highly dramatised, not least because there was at the time no question about Russell's future at the team, as he was under contract for 2025, and the episode made it feel as if there was. This year, Russell has answered those questions emphatically, as team principal Toto Wolff said after Singapore. ""That's the step-up he has made also this year,"" Wolff said. ""That these things don't happen again. He's been formidable this year. I haven't seen mistakes. ""There were weekends that he himself said he could have done more and that it wasn't a good race. But this happens with any driver. ""You can see when it merges the car being in a perfect space and the driver being on top of things. That becomes the dominant formula and that is what we've seen here."" Russell would be close to the top of anyone's list of best drivers of 2025. Earlier this year, when there was some question about Verstappen's future at Red Bull, Russell looked like he might be under threat at the team. But an announcement confirming a new contract is believed to be imminent.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cvgm578le7jo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/a859/live/15598bf0-a20d-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png,2025-10-14T06:29:47.313000+00:00,53254e24de2fc5f328af1a200591f80e709a1cf5

4fee5a643668,O'Neill critical of 'over fussy' ref in Germany loss,,"O'Neill, who was taking charge of NI for the 100th time as manager, praised his players for ""giving everything"" but was ultimately left to rue poor defending from a corner that allowed Woltemade to score, albeit fortuitously as the ball bounced off his shoulder and into the net. Dan Ballard had a goal disallowed in the first half, while Jamie Reid, Ethan Galbraith and Callum Marshal were among players who went close for an NI side that penned Germany back in the last quarter of the game. ""First half, we lacked a little bit of belief with the ball, but we were in the game and weren't conceding a lot of chances,"" he added. ""The goal was a freak goal; it comes off his shoulder. We should have defended it better. ""Second half we were well in it. It's a game we should have gone ahead in; we have the goal disallowed for offside and we shouldn't be offside. ""We had a chance or two at the end, Justin [Devenny] doesn't settle himself to hit it, and Callum makes the goalkeeper make a save. Fatigue a bit at the end, but we couldn't have asked for anymore and it's just disappointing to lose the game."" The defeat leaves Northern Ireland third in Group A, three points behind Germany and Slovakia. They round off their campaign with an away game against Slovakia and a home match against Luxembourg next month. O'Neill acknowledged that their trip to Kosice is a must-not-lose game to keep them in contention for finishing second in the group and securing a play-off. ""I haven't really looked at it, but we will hope four points will be enough next month, but we have to go to Slovakia and make sure we are not beaten so we then have something to play for,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd7r30p1l5no,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/90ca/live/15ce1830-a87a-11f0-8d21-ad9b41c65325.jpg,2025-10-13T21:43:08.563000+00:00,7c9dcc665349d74ee1b5bacb793146ccccd3d79d
88bf122e5971,South Africa survive scare to beat Bangladesh,,"Nadine de Klerk got South Africa over the line again as they recovered from another top-order collapse to beat Bangladesh by three wickets at the Women's World Cup. Having been set 233 to win in Visakhapatnam, the Proteas slipped to 78-5 before half-centuries from Chloe Tryon, who made 62 from 69 balls, and Marizanne Kapp, 56 from 71 balls, brought them back into contention. Kapp fell with 70 still needed to bring De Klerk - fresh from her heroics against India - to the middle, and for a time it seemed that she and Tryon would get South Africa home comfortably. Instead, Tryon was run out with 35 required and there were more uncomfortable moments to come as De Klerk twice miscued in the penultimate over with match in the balance. While the first skied shot landed safely, the second went straight to long-off but Shorna Akter dropped the catch - a particularly cruel moment given it was the 18-year-old's superb 34-ball fifty that had earlier taken Bangladesh up to a competitive total. But having been given that life, De Klerk - who ended unbeaten on 37 from 29 balls - made sure she finished the job and a mighty six over the leg side sealed the victory with three balls to spare. While South Africa can celebrate a third straight win, and a second in a row in which they have battled back from a losing position, Bangladesh are left to rue a number of crucial dropped catches. Rabeya Khan put down a simple chance off her own bowling to give Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt a chance early on. Sub fielder Soumya Akter then dropped Tryon on 46 off Rabeya's bowling in the 44th over, allowing the ball to run away for four, with the next ball disappearing for six before Shorna's drop late on.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cy8vxgplj04o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/dab4/live/87232af0-a859-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T17:36:24.471000+00:00,61e2997b6e9d2015946b05632ec74f79d1160d59

This month Uefa ""reluctantly"" approved next February's fixture between the sides taking place outside Italy because there is no legal framework to stop it. Spanish La Liga clubs Villarreal and Barcelona are also set to face each other in Miami in December having received permission from European football's governing body. A lengthy statement from Como , external made the case for the fixture being moved to Australia and noted Serie A's domestic broadcast deal was worth Â£780m a year. They said the Â£12bn the Premier League will receive for the cycle between 2025 and 2029 for domestic and overseas rights means the league will ""dominate the global stage"". Como said the ""imbalance"" gave English football ""enormous financial advantage""  and the decision to stage the match overseas is ""not a matter of greed"". ""We understand that this journey may demand sacrifices in convenience, comfort, and routine,"" said Como. ""Yet sometimes sacrifice is essential, not for individual benefit but for the greater good, for growth, and above all for the survival of the league itself. ""Most clubs in Italy are not profitable.

Gavin Plumb was found guilty of soliciting murder and inciting rape and kidnap after a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. The 38-year-old, from Harlow in Essex, was sentenced in July 2024 to life in prison with a minimum term of 16 years . According to listings at the Court of Appeal in London, an appeal against his conviction will be heard on 21 October. At his sentencing, judge Mr Justice Murray said some of the plans Plumb discussed online were ""sadistic, brutal and degrading"". Plumb was snared by an undercover police officer from the US who infiltrated an online chatroom called Abduct Lovers. He became so concerned about Plumb's posts - outlining his ""ultimate fantasy"" of violence against Ms Willoughby - that he passed information to the FBI. US law enforcement in turn contacted British police, who raided the defendant's flat in Potters Field and found an ""abduction kit"" complete with cable ties and bottles of chloroform. Getty Images Ms Willoughby ended her 14-year stint on This Morning after the offences came to light in October 2023 Jurors heard Plumb's plan involved an ""ambush"" of Ms Willoughby at her family home - even discussing taking time off work to organise the attack. They were also told of his previous convictions for attempted kidnap and how he had ""millions"" of images of Ms Willoughby on a device found at his property. During the eight-day trial, Plumb argued it was just online chat and fantasy. But Mr Justice Murray dismissed this, saying: ""I have no doubt this was all considerably more than a fantasy to you.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjwlgknlrlo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fdd6/live/eb003690-a85d-11f0-a6a1-7df40e0558bb.png,2025-10-13T20:21:05.527000+00:00,ec8dce5f833b9251d88526d11d0a164200bf039d

Ben Hatcher, 20, from Monyash near Bakewell, was pulled out of the crowd by the star during her sell-out show at the Sheffield Utilita Arena on Friday.

a3c6274b231c,Mr Scorsese review: This series about the great US film-maker is a must-watch,,"Scorsese's father kept his nose clean, but often had to intervene to save his brother, the film-maker's uncle, Joe ""The Bug"" Scorsese, the other inspiration for Johnny Boy. I thought I knew Scorsese's story well, but I had never heard about Joe the Bug. Along the way, Scorsese adds surprising details about how his boyhood still affects his art. His asthma kept him indoors, looking out from an upper floor window onto the street. ""That's why I like high-angle shots,"" he says. The documentary offers a reminder that his career has had more ups and downs than most people might think, now that he is acclaimed as one of the greatest living film-makers. De Niro urged him to make The King of Comedy (1982) and again Scorsese reluctantly agreed. But he sometimes didn't show up on set until the afternoon. ""I didn't want to be there,"" he says. The film, with De Niro as the celebrity-stalking Rupert Pupkin, is now considered a brilliant, ahead-of-its-time take on fame and fan obsession, but it was a box-office disaster. Scorsese came back, but more than a decade later, the commercial flops of Kundun (1997) and Bringing Out the Dead (1999) made his career, as he puts it, ""dead again "" . DiCaprio had the clout to get Gangs of New York (2002) made, reversing that latest setback. Apple TV+ Scorsese with star Leonardo DiCaprio on the set of The Aviator (2004) (Credit: Apple TV+) It's also easy to forget how controversial some of his films were, often because of their violence, notably Taxi Driver and its rampaging anti-hero Travis Bickle. Scorsese says that when he read Schrader's screenplay it was ""almost as if I had written it myself"". Miller asks, ""What of you, in that moment, do you feel is in that film most?"" He pauses and answers carefully, making it clear that he does not act like or condone Travis Bickle, then says, ""The anger, the loneliness, no way of really connecting with people"" – the sense of being an outsider that he again links to a working-class background that made him an odd fit in New York University film school and in Hollywood. ""Violence is scary in yourself. Are you capable of it?"" he reflects, adding that violence on screen is a positive thing ""if it's truthful violence"". Taxi Driver exploded into the headlines again in 1981 when John Hinckley, obsessed with Jodie Foster as a child prostitute in the film, shot Ronald Reagan. The Academy Awards were postponed by a day after the shooting, and Rossellini recalls that Scorsese wore a bullet-proof vest to the Oscars. The documentary doesn't dwell on Scorsese's private life. He admits that work made him a distant father to the older two of his three children from different marriages, all of whom are interviewed here and are on good terms with him. But he was there for Francesca, his youngest child, who has recently made him a TikTok star with videos like Dad Guesses Slang. More like this: • 11 of the best TV shows to watch this October • The overlooked 'goddess' of Italian cinema • The making of one of film's greatest shots And when Scorsese is circumspect, Miller deftly adds more information. He says he had panic attacks while making Gangs of New York because, among other vague reasons, ""people are sick"". Miller inserts a photo of his wife, Helen, to whom he has been married for 26 years. As Francesca later explains, her mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's even before that.

3b6009ee1493,"Cyber attack contingency plans should be put on paper, firms told",,"Criminal hacks on Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Jaguar Land Rover have led to empty shelves and production lines being halted this year as the companies struggled without their computer systems. Organisations need to ""have a plan for how they would continue to operate without their IT, (and rebuild that IT at pace), were an attack to get through,"" said Richard Horne, chief executive of the NCSC. Firms are being urged to look beyond cyber-security controls toward a strategy known as ""resilience engineering"", which focuses on building systems that can anticipate, absorb, recover, and adapt, in the event of an attack. Plans should be stored in paper form or offline, the agency suggests and include information about how teams will communicate without work email and other analogue work arounds. These types of cyber attack contingency plans are not new but it's notable that the UK's cyber authority is putting the advice prominently in its annual review. Although the total number of hacks that the NCSC dealt with in the first nine months of this year was, at 429, roughly the same as for a similar period last year, there was an increase in hacks with a bigger impact. The number of ""nationally significant"" incidents represented nearly half, or 204, of all incidents. Last year only 89 were in that category. A nationally significant incident covers cyber-attacks in the three highest categories in the NCSC and UK law enforcement categorisation model : Category 1: National cyber-emergency. Category 2: Highly significant incident. Category 3: Significant incident. Category 4: Substantial incident. Category 5: Moderate incident. Category 6: Localised incident. Amongst this year's incidents, 4% (18) were in the second highest category ""highly significant"". This marks a 50% increase in such incidents, an increase for the third consecutive year. The NCSC would not give details on which attacks, either public or undisclosed, fall into which category. But, as a benchmark, it is understood that the wave of attacks on UK retailers in the spring, which affected Marks and Spencer, The Co-op and Harrods, would be classed as a Significant incident. One of the most serious attacks last year, on a blood testing provider, caused major problems for London hospitals. It resulted in significant clinical disruption and directly contributed to at least one patient death. The NCSC would not say which category this incident would fall into. The vast majority of attacks are financially motivated with criminal gangs using ransomware or data extortion to blackmail a victim into sending Bitcoins in ransom. Whilst most cyber-crime gangs are headquartered in Russian or former Soviet countries, there has been a resurgence in teenage hacking gangs thought to be based in English-speaking countries. So far this year seven teenagers have been arrested in the UK as part of investigations into major cyber-attacks. As well as the advice over heightened preparations and collaboration, the government is asking organisations to make better use of the free tools and services offered by the NCSC, for example free cyber-insurance for small businesses that have completed the popular Cyber-Essentials programme.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced61xv967lo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e5f8/live/f52c7d90-a8c6-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-13T23:04:57.470000+00:00,d89397e5653f551ed9275dcc420022d3150b56ad
03a7d25588a2,Tens of thousands of homes insulated under government schemes need repairs,,"Tens of thousands of homes insulated under government schemes need repairs Zoe Conway BBC News correspondent and Pritti Mistry business reporter BBC Mohammed Mahedi noticed problems almost immediately following insulation work in his home in 2023 Two government schemes aimed at cutting energy use by insulating homes were botched on a vast scale, a spending watchdog has found, leaving tens of thousands of homes in need of remedial work. According to the National Audit Office (NAO) 98% of homes that had external wall insulation installed under the schemes set up by the previous government have problems that will lead to damp and mould if left unaddressed. Nearly a third, or 29%, of the homes that were given internal insulation also need fixing, it said. Energy Consumer Minister Martin McCluskey said the government was taking action and that the homes would be fixed ""at no cost to the consumer"". Mohammed Mahedi, who had external wall insulation fitted to his Luton home two years ago, is living with the consequences. External insulation involves insulation boards being fitted to the exterior brickwork of a house with render then applied to make it waterproof. It goes wrong when rainwater becomes trapped behind it. ''Some mornings I wake up breathing really, really heavily. I feel it in my neck. I feel it in my lungs,'' he says. The BBC first reported the impact of faulty insulation in Luton last year. Mohammed is still fighting to get the problem fixed. ""We got a scheme done that was meant to be helping us but it's made everything worse.'' Lukman Ashraf Botched insulation work has left dry rot in other homes in Luton The NAO report focused on work carried out between 2022 and the start of 2025 on two specific schemes, ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme. In 2022 the previous government directed energy companies to spend billions of pounds, raised via levies on energy bills, on insulating homes across the UK, targeting people receiving benefits and those in very poorly insulated homes. However, the NAO found there were ""clear failures"" in the design of the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme, which resulted in ""poor-quality installations as well as suspected fraud"". Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said it was now up to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to ensure the businesses responsible repaired ""all affected homes as quickly as possible"". ""It must also reform the system so that this cannot happen again,"" he said. The NAO, which monitors how public money is spent, cited an ""under-skilled workforce"", businesses cutting corners and uncertainty over which standards to apply to which jobs, as some of the reasons for the substandard work. It found that between 22,000 and 23,000 homes that had received external wall insulation, and up to 13,000 properties with internal wall insulation were now in need of repairs. More than 1,000 homeowners have been living in homes that pose an ""immediate health and safety risk"", from faults such as exposed live electrical cabling or blocked boiler ventilation, the NAO said. The NAO also directed criticism at TrustMark, a consumer protection scheme set up in 2021 to monitor the quality of insulation programmes. It said there had been ""weak"" oversight and insufficient auditing of the schemes. The NAO said that had allowed installers to ""game"" the system. Last year the whole-industry regulator, Ofgem, estimated that businesses had falsified claims for ECO installations in up to 16,500 homes, potentially claiming between £56m and £165m from energy suppliers. TrustMark said it accepted that more needed to be done and said it remained ""completely committed to ensuring strong consumer protection and confidence"". It said the organisation took ""firm, fair and decisive action"" when it first noticed issues with the work in 2024 and ""kept industry groups and government fully informed at every stage"". Energy Minister McCluskey said the NAO report revealed ""unacceptable, systemic failings"" left by the previous government. He said there would be ""comprehensive reforms"" and ""clear lines of accountability"" in future.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w965gz8zgo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7681/live/b86c8290-a8c8-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-14T07:04:00.423000+00:00,07b642be8876f47162ddc4b7795ab9945822a91d
22fe81aca6a0,Wage growth slows slightly over summer,,"Wage growth slows slightly over summer Emer Moreau Business reporter Getty Images Wage growth in the UK cooled slightly over the summer, as unemployment ticked up marginally. Average wage growth was 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% over the three months to July, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The national unemployment rate rose slightly from 4.7% to 4.8%. Analysts said the data indicated that the UK jobs market was stabilising after a year of volatility. Job vancancies fell by 9,000, or 1.3%, in the three months to September, and the ONS said this was the 39th consecutive period in which job openings had fallen compared to the previous three months. Liz McKeown, the ONS's director of economic statistics, said: ""After a long period of weak hiring activity, there are signs that the falls we have seen in both payroll numbers and vacancies are now levelling off."" Ms McKeown said the ONS was seeing different patterns among age groups, adding ""the increase in unemployment was driven mostly by younger people."" There was a quarterly drop in the number of people who were economically inactive because they were students or retired, but this was largely offset by a rise in economic inactivity for other reasons, including long-term illness and for other reasons. The ONS has said the unemployment rate should be treated with caution and it is taking additional steps to address concerns about the quality of the data. Private sector earnings growth was the lowest in four years but was still ahead of inflation. Annual growth in workers' average earnings was 6% for the public sector and 4.4% for the private sector. Ashley Webb, an economist with Capital Economics, said that stubbornly high wage growth may prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates before the end of the year. ""But we think it's only a matter of time before the loosening in the labour market leads to a more marked easing in wage growth, which would allow the Bank to cut rates,"" he said. Chris Hare, the senior UK economist at HSBC, said the data indicates ""a fairly steady labour market"". ""I think we're probably seeing fairly soft demand for labour in the economy,"" he said, adding that it should lead to ""a gradual easing in broader cost pressures in the labour market and an easing in wage growth"". The ONS said the public sector annual growth rate is affected by some public sector pay rises being paid earlier in 2025 than in 2024. After the public sector, the wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants sector showed the strongest regular annual growth rate. The number of people who were made redundant between June and August increased from the same period last year, to 3.8 per 1,000 employees in June to August 2025. The ONS also revised the previous figure for wage growth, bringing it up from 4.7% to 4.8%. This figure will likely be used to calculate the increase to the state pension for next year. Under the triple lock policy, the state pension is increased by the highest of wage growth, inflation or 2.5%. 'Paltry' real wage growth Inflation currently stands at 3.8% , meaning that real wage growth - how much better off workers are when accounting for rises in the cost of living - is 0.9%. Responding to the figures, the Liberal Democrats said that real wage growth is barely keeping up with inflation. Similarly, the Resolution Foundation said real wage growth was ""paltry"", and that real weekly wages have only increased by £1.50 since last September — ""barely enough to cover the cost of a Greggs sausage roll"". Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the think tank, said: ""The UK's longstanding weakness in the jobs market has finally caught up with pay packets. ""The deteriorating labour market, coupled with persistently high inflation, means that cost of living pressures are likely to build over the autumn.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjek274q99xo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a85b/live/f4a8f5b0-a8c6-11f0-b0df-05ea5e3542cc.jpg,2025-10-14T07:36:00.652000+00:00,786deb3f7223823020bda9e4ca1fb1bcffcc5903
1984dfea15dc,Would-be drivers to be encouraged to donate blood,,"People applying for a driving licence will be encouraged to donate blood as part of a campaign to boost numbers of donors. Officials estimate the message - a link to register as a blood donor in emails following driving licence applications - will be seen by millions of people each year. By encouraging driving licence applicants, the NHS hopes to make a direct appeal to young people, as more than half of regular blood donors are over the age of 45. Tim Moss, chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), said his organisation is ""in a unique position to help raise awareness"" as it handles millions of driving licence applications each year. People can donate blood from the age of 17 and register from the age of 16. The new scheme is jointly rolled out by the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the body that oversees England's blood donation system. ""At 17 you can both learn to drive and start giving blood,"" said Altaf Kazi, assistant partnerships director for NHSBT. ""So this new partnership with the DVLA is a fantastic opportunity for the NHS to reach more younger people who have a lifetime of donating ahead of them,"" Kazi added. The two bodies hope to repeat an earlier success where the driving licence application has included an option to join the organ donor register since 1994. Around 70% of people signed up to the register did so through this prompt, according to NHSBT. Hospitals across England need 5,000 blood donations every day to treat patients with a wide variety of conditions, including traumatic injury, childbirth, blood disorders and cancer treatments, it added. Earlier this year, the NHS warned that it continued to face a ""challenging"" blood shortage, as it called for 200,000 new donors to come forward in order to maintain a safe and reliable supply. Concern over blood stocks prompted the health service to issue an ""amber alert"" last year, meaning supplies were running low enough to have an impact on patient treatment. Supplies have remained low ever since, with officials warning there is a ""critical"" need for more donors who have O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ln4rgz05o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3dde/live/ffcfcef0-a8a3-11f0-9d5d-7553fd6e9082.jpg,2025-10-14T04:35:40.668000+00:00,c41e364e7c8fa7a4d693f10541dfc32062d9228f
091888c1a657,Undercover officer played role in Stephen Lawrence inquiry clashes,,"Undercover officer played role in Stephen Lawrence inquiry clashes Dominic Casciani Home and Legal Correspondent PA Media An undercover officer was part of clashes when the five men originally accused of Lawrence murder appeared at an inquiry in 1998 An undercover police officer took part in clashes during the Stephen Lawrence inquiry as part of his cover so he could better spy on anti-racism groups, one of the UK's longest-running public inquiries has been told. The decade-old Undercover Policing Inquiry, which began its latest phase of hearings on Monday, heard that there may be evidence of overt racism in how a now-disbanded team targeted black justice campaigners in the 1990s. Officers gathered information relating to Baroness Lawrence and Dr Neville Lawrence as they fought for justice over their son's 1993 racist murder, even though they had nothing to do with groups which the police force believed could be a danger to public order. The inquiry - which has cost £114m so far - began in 2015 after allegations emerged of abuses by undercover officers, including deceiving women into sexual relationships. In an opening statement on Monday, the inquiry's lead lawyer David Barr KC said it would hear ""deeply moving"" evidence from justice campaigners including the Lawrence family and Sukdev Reel, whose son Ricky died in 1997 in what many suspect was a racist murder. Mr Barr said that the inquiry would look at why Scotland Yard had deployed undercover officers to gather information relating to campaigns such as these and to what extent those operations may have been motivated by racism. One of those officers was a man known only as HN81 or ""David Hagan"" due to an anonymity order. By 1997 he had been deployed to gather intelligence on the anti-racism movement in London at a time when the force was preparing to face a public inquiry over how it had botched the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder. Stephen, 18, was stabbed by a gang as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London. While the thrust of the evidence so far is that HN81 did not get close enough to the family to have become a key figure in their campaign, he has admitted being part of infamous clashes on the day that the five murder suspects gave evidence to the Lawrence inquiry in 1998. ""He [HN81] accepts being involved in the public disorder,"" Mr Barr said. ""HN81 describes that day as the most serious incident of public disorder he witnessed and participated in. He describes shouting, aggressive posturing and joining in with the pushing and shoving once that had begun."" The police ultimately used CS gas to try to control the crowd - leading to Baroness Lawrence appealing for calm. ""It is undeniable that the Stephen Lawrence Campaign was conducted throughout in a manner that defied public disorder, advocating for order and calm, even where some would have had it otherwise,"" said Mr Barr. ""Dr Neville Lawrence is appalled that a police officer was involved in such action. He has stated to the inquiry that it is (I quote) 'particularly troubling that an officer who sought to justify surveillance on the grounds of public disorder actively contributed to it'."" Another key witness for the latest tranche of evidence is Peter Francis, a former officer of the now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad at the heart of the allegations of wrongdoing. His revelations were one of the factors that triggered the public inquiry. When he gives evidence in December, Mr Francis is expected to say that in 1993 - six months after Stephen's murder - he was receiving racially-motivated orders from a manager known only as ""HN86"" to gather information relating to that justice campaign and other causes. ""Mr Francis portrays HN86 as a thoroughly and overtly racist man who, amongst other things, instructed him to seek out intelligence for the purpose of undermining black justice campaigns,"" said Mr Barr. ""In particular, information about the Lawrence family which could be used to discredit them and to destroy the Stephen Lawrence Campaign. ""Mr Francis asserts that he was also expected to report information that might discredit Duwayne Brooks [Stephen Lawrence's friend who had been with him on the night of the fatal attack]. ""HN86 denies these allegations. We will be looking at them very closely indeed."" In a brief opening address, Peter Skelton KC, representing the Metropolitan Police, said the force apologised to the family of Stephen Lawrence, his friend Duwayne Brooks, Sukhdev Reel, and other justice campaigners. ""There was a collective failure to exercise ethical judgment about the purpose of undercover policing and the propriety of reporting on family justice campaigns,"" he said. ""This is reflective of an 'us against them' culture that prevailed within the MPS at that time, which didn't properly distinguish between legitimate intelligence targets, such as groups committed to inciting serious public disorder, and illegitimate targets such as grieving black and Asian families who were complaining about injustice and the actions of the police.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c803ex1xgr5o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c245/live/0b16ba80-a859-11f0-a6a1-7df40e0558bb.jpg,2025-10-13T18:52:50.049000+00:00,ddb36d5ea70789fd17ce2fe441be48b77a2fb7e5
41856f834707,Spending cuts loom if Drakeford budget falls in Senedd,,"Spending cuts loom if Drakeford budget falls in Senedd Daniel Davies Wales political correspondent PA Media Former first minister Mark Drakeford is the Welsh government's current finance secretary Public services have been threatened with big cuts if Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford cannot convince political opponents to support the budget he starts publishing on Tuesday. Worth more than £27bn, the Welsh government's spending plans for next year pays for services from hospitals to bin collections. The Senedd has to vote in favour to approve it, but the Labour government does not have enough members to win those votes without other parties. A looming by-election could make the political arithmetic even more difficult. This budget will be inherited by the winner of next year's Senedd election. Drakeford has said he does not want to tie the hands of the next Welsh government . He has promised a budget designed to minimise political wrangling, but negotiations with other parties are inevitable. First Minister Eluned Morgan says she expects the budget that finally gets through the Senedd in the spring to be very different from Tuesday's first outline draft. Minority government 'Mass redundancies' On Tuesday, Drakeford will allot money for government departments for 2026-27. A detailed breakdown, with spreadsheets showing funding for public services, will follow on 3 November. Weeks of lobbying and scrutiny will follow - and in the meantime Chancellor Rachel Reeves will publish her budget. Most of the Welsh government's funding comes from her. A vote on the final budget is due on 27 January . If the budget does not pass by the start of the financial year in April the government is only allowed to spend 75% of last year's budget. That would require big cuts, with Morgan warning of ""mass redundancies"". The spending limit rises to 95% if a budget still has not been passed by the end of July. A government can table a budget vote during the financial year, so it could try again after 1 April. Labour's options The Welsh Conservatives said Drakeford should publish a budget that ""delivers for the taxpayer"". The party last week said it would scrap land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has not closed the door on talking to the government, but says ""it's Labour's budget"". ""I don't think anybody wants to face a situation where there isn't a budget in place for next year,"" he said. Dodds's spokesperson said she recognised what was at stake for public services. ""That means Jane is ready to listen and work with other parties, something that neither the Conservatives nor Plaid Cymru were willing to do in the last budget,"" they said. Reform, which has one MS after the defection of Laura Ann Jones, said it would not support a budget that continues to fund the Nation of Sanctuary policy.

Downdetector, which monitors web outages, showed more than 130,000 people had flagged problems affecting their Vodafone broadband or mobile network on Monday afternoon. According to its website, the firm has more than 18 million customers in the UK, including nearly 700,000 home broadband customers. In an updated statement on Monday evening, Vodafone apologised to customers and said its network was ""recovering"". ""This afternoon the Vodafone network had an issue affecting broadband, 4G and 5G services,"" a company spokesperson said. ""2G voice calls and SMS messaging were unaffected and the network is now recovering. ""We apologise for any inconvenience this caused our customers."" It comes after people on social media said they were struggling to access Vodafone customer service operators, amid ongoing issues affecting mobile data and broadband. Many also said they have had difficulty accessing the company's website and app, which typically allow people to view the status of its network services. Customers have also taken to social media to complain of ""complete outages"" in their area. The issues appear to have begun for customers shortly after 15:00 BST. Internet monitor Netblocks said in a post on X that live network data showed Vodafone was experiencing ""a national outage"" impacting both broadband and mobile data. Some customers expressed being doubly frustrated by not being able to access their Wi-Fi or mobile data. ""Sort it out soon please,"" wrote one frustrated X user - who said they were having to use a coffee shop's Wi-Fi to access online services, without the means to do so using their mobile data or broadband. Another said they were self-employed and could not work because of the outage, adding: ""Never regretted more having my mobile and broadband on the same network."" The issues are also understood to have impacted some Vodafone shops. BBC News A Vodafone store in Clapham, south-west London, was seen by BBC News to have  information signs on its windows, with multiple customers waiting outside asking staff what was going on with their signal. 'Dropped off the internet' The issues affecting Vodafone services have also impacted customers of other telecoms firms that use its network. Downdetector saw a similar spike in reports on Monday afternoon from users of the mobile network Voxi, which is owned by Vodafone. Lebara, which piggy-backs off Vodafone's network, has also been affected by the company's outage. ""Outages have been reported across multiple networks across broadband and mobile services,"" said Sabrina Hoque, telecoms expert at Uswitch. These, she added, can be ""a really frustrating experience for customers, especially when it's not clear how long it could last"". Vodafone has not yet said how long it expects its outage to last - though its website since appears to have come back online. Cloudflare Radar, which tracks and displays patterns in global internet traffic, said in a post on Bluesky earlier it had ""effectively dropped off the internet, with traffic dropping to zero"". The company has also not said what caused the issue affecting its networks. ""Incidents like this are often caused by a technical fault or configuration error rather than a major cyber-attack, so until more details are confirmed it's best not to speculate,"" said Daniel Card, a cyber expert with BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.

A number of fronts feature full-page picture spreads - a photograph of hostage Alon Ohel smiling with his family leads the Daily Express, paired with the headline ""The long, painful nightmare is over"". ""Two years of torment over"" declares the Times, picturing hostages Alon Ohel, Evyatar David and Avinatan Or reuniting with their respective loved ones. The paper says US President Donald Trump hailed an ""end of an age of terror and death"" in his speech following the hostage release, and urged members of the Israeli parliament not to resume hostilities. Monday was a ""rare moment of joy among both Israelis and Palestinians"", according to the Guardian, which carries a photograph of people rejoicing in Tel Aviv and another photo of a released Palestinian hugging his son. The paper reports that large crowds also gathered in Khan Younis for the return of nearly 1,700 Palestinians who had been detained during the war, while the West Bank capital Ramallah received 88 detainees who were serving life sentences in Israel. ""We did not give up faith, we did not lose hope"" reads the headline of the i Paper, detailing the ""jubilation and relief"" for Israeli families after the release of the 20 remaining living hostages. The Financial Times leads on Trump's speech to the Israeli parliament, and reports that the president received multiple standing ovations as he ""set out a grand postwar vision"". The paper hones in on the second phase of the ceasefire, which it says diplomats believe will be ""far more complicated"", and notes that it has not been formally agreed to by Israel and Hamas. Trump also used his speech to touch on other peace deals he hopes to broker, and the Telegraph says he told the Knesset that he plans to ""focus on Russia first"". The paper reports that the Ukrainian prime minister and his top aide flew to Washington DC on Monday to begin ""high level talks to strengthen Ukraine's defense"", amid ""mounting"" speculation over the US president's decision to ship Tomohawk weapons to the nation. ""Home and now it's time for peace"" reads the headline of the Metro, alongside a photo of the moment twin Israeli hostages Ziv and Gali Berman reunited. The front page of the Star also focuses on the twins, featuring a full-page photograph of the brothers embracing with the headline ""Hug of love"". All 20 Israeli hostages have been pictured on the front page of the Sun, with the paper declaring they have been ""freed from hell"" after 737 days in captivity. ""Noa's hero is home"" says the Daily Mail, reporting on hostage Avinatan Or being reunited with his girlfriend and former hostage Noa Argamani, who was rescued in 2024. And the Mirror features a poignant image of Mr Or holding his hands up in a heart, calling it a ""message of love for the world"". Its headline is: ""Day we thought we'd never see."" The hostage and prisoner exchange that has accompanied the ceasefire in the war in Gaza dominates Tuesday's front pages. ""Freed from hell"" is the way the Sun headlines its coverage of the release of hostages after 737 days of captivity - over a photo of 24-year-old Evyatar David - last publicly seen in a Hamas video in August, digging what was described as ""his own grave"". The Daily Mirror says it was a day we thought we'd never see - picturing Avinatan Or making a heart gesture with his hands. He also features on the front of the Daily Mail , reuniting with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was rescued from captivity in June last year; the paper notes that he managed to hide the fact that he was an Israeli Special Forces soldier from his captors. The Times says two years of torment are over - the Daily Star talks of the ""hug of love"" as it shows the reunion of twins, Gali and Ziv Berman, who had been locked up separately. The Guardian says the truce has brought joy to both Israelis and Palestinians - picturing Israelis celebrating in Tel Aviv - and Palestinians hanging out of bus windows as they celebrate with the crowds below them. The Financial Times says Donald Trump is enjoying his moment in the sun, but warns that peace is not yet a done deal. Writing in the Daily Express , the former British Army commander Richard Kemp says hopes of a lasting peace in the Middle East will need longer than Trump's remaining time in the White House, so his most important task will be to ensure that he is succeeded by someone who shares his commitment to peace through strength. In the meantime, the Daily Telegraph suggests Trump is now looking for his next project, saying he now wants to end the Ukraine war. The former Foreign Secretary William Hague writes, in the Times , that peace could be possible there too, if Trump takes note of his own lesson in Gaza and again backs diplomacy with hard power. It might even lead to that Nobel peace prize at last, he concludes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0453xd72yo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7179/live/3edfcbe0-a88b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png,2025-10-14T05:18:54.111000+00:00,1d3a17d882c23a4f0ab87339bbbdaece245f4c1c
96daf26d5ad6,Learning to sign changed my life after a brain injury,,"Learning to sign changed my life after a brain injury Rogan Productions Tina was in a coma for six weeks after falling down a flight of stairs As Tina walks onto the stage in front of hundreds of people she is beaming. She's collecting her British Sign Language (BSL) certificate which is the culmination of a journey that began with tragedy. ""Learning BSL has helped me say words that I cannot speak,"" she says. In 2018, while returning from a holiday, Tina fell down a flight of stairs and was in a coma for six weeks. The accident caused a traumatic brain injury that dramatically changed her life, leaving her struggling to speak. Before the fall, Tina had been a high achiever - she and her husband Mark met while working as navigators in the RAF, and Tina went on to retrain as a lawyer. Now 59, Tina says learning sign language has given her a new way to communicate. ""I'm scared of talking sometimes but BSL has helped me relax as sometimes I remember the sign if I can't remember a word."" Three years ago, Tina and Mark moved to Hughenden Gardens Retirement Village in High Wycombe to access more support. ""When I arrived here I only spoke a bit and I was very silent as I wasn't very confident,"" explains Tina. But as a result of moving to the village, they became participants in the BBC series Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands, New Tricks , filmed in March, which set out to explore how British Sign Language could transform the lives of older residents. Rogan Productions Participants of Rose's documentary say the process of learning BSL was rewarding despite being challenging at times The series sees Rose, who has been deaf since birth, teach BSL to a group of older residents, showing how it uses visual sign language using gestures, facial expressions and body language to communicate. ""People think sign language is just for deaf people but it's so much more than that, especially for people who are losing their hearing,"" Ayling-Ellis explains. ""BSL has helped Tina communicate as you use your face and expressions as well as hands so you can understand emotions better,"" Mark, 64, says. She is one of five residents to achieve a Level 1 BSL qualification, alongside several staff members. ""I'm so proud of them,"" Ayling-Ellis says. ""I didn't think they could get further than the alphabet but they proved me wrong and should be proud of themselves."" Tina has continued to learn BSL after the documentary through classes taught by her husband. Despite never intending to teach, after taking part in the TV series, Mark now leads regular practice sessions with 20 people. ""We raised some money to get a proper instructor to give us lessons but alongside the formal lessons I run a group every week for a few hours where I put people through their paces,"" Mark says. The pair have benefited immensely from learning BSL, but ""it was surprisingly tiring"". ""I'm fit and heathy and was still finding it tough going - we were knackered from it,"" Mark says. There were classes three times a week and then homework and revision in the evening. The group started by learning the alphabet and numbers which came in handy when the residents hosted a signed bingo evening. The lessons also proved useful in unexpected ways. ""At medical appointments we realised we could sign to each other to communicate something privately,"" explains Mark. Rogan Productions Tina is one of five participants from the show who have passed their BSL Level 1 Since the documentary aired, the couple have helped turn Hughenden Gardens into a hub of deaf awareness. ""We are running deaf classes, building links with local deaf community and investigating new technologies to help people with hearing problems,"" Mark says. A monthly Deaf Café has been launched and a Jewish Deaf Association group of 29 people is due to visit the village later this month. It's also bought residents closer together and fostered a sense of community as ""there's nothing like adversity to help a team gel,"" according to Mark. Rogan Productions The impact is being felt far beyond Hughenden. Mark says: ""Since March we've had many interesting visitors - one from Canada and there's a deaf club in another retirement village where there are 20 people all learning BSL. The retirement village is now focusing on how to be more deaf inclusive. Plans include deaf awareness training for all staff, new deaf-friendly entry intercoms, improved signage and the rollout of SignLive, a deaf-led video interpreting app. While Mark continues to transform the retirement village, Tina is pleased that BSL has helped her regain confidence and improve her communication. And the ripple effect continues. ""Our family all watched the documentary,"" says Mark. ""And people come up to us in the streets to say we've inspired people to take it up.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8vl1kye4yo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e0fa/live/b0ad8fe0-a850-11f0-a6a1-7df40e0558bb.jpg,2025-10-14T02:07:48.209000+00:00,2b4a4637705e3cc5384984b4bda69124d7b5eb7d

Nadia Yahlom was filmed removing the ribbons attached to railings at Princes Avenue Park in Muswell Hill, in Haringey, on 6 October - the eve of the two-year anniversary of the Israel-Gaza war. She spoke to the BBC exclusively, before the release of the last 20 surviving hostages and the return of almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Monday. She asked why are the ""only lives worth commemorating Jewish lives?"". Members of the local Jewish community have condemned her actions, with one of the people who challenged her at the time describing them as ""morally repugnant"". 'Witch hunt' Ms Yahlom said she never intended to become a focus of attention and had been threatened with rape and violence since cutting down the ribbons, which symbolised calls for a return of the hostages captured by Hamas two years ago. ""I am a Palestinian-Jewish woman living in that community who has every right to take a stance against genocide - a genocide that is being conducted in my name,"" she said. In the widely shared video footage, she was heard being criticised as she took the ribbons down. The yellow ""bring them home"" ribbon symbolises hope for the safe return of hostages held in Gaza, taken on 7 October 2023. Ms Yahlom was interviewed under caution by police following the removal of the ribbons from the railings on Fortis Green Road, although she was not arrested. Watch: Woman cuts down yellow ribbons in Muswell Hill When asked why she took the ribbons down, Ms Yahlom told BBC London that after two years of ""genocide"" in Gaza, ""we are still being told that the only lives worth commemorating, the only lives that have any value, are Jewish lives"". ""To me, it's astonishing that there can be moral repugnance about a handful of ribbons being cut and not generations and generations and generations of bloodlines [in Gaza] being cut."" A recent United Nations commission of inquiry report found that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza , although Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as ""distorted and false"". Israel's bombing campaign and ground invasion have killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In her interview with the BBC, Ms Yahlom defended her actions ""as a peaceful form of protest"", saying said she had felt ""offended, intimidated and threatened"" by the presence of the ribbons. She added that she did not think the ribbons truly represented Israeli civilian hostages. Although Ms Yahlom was seen removing the ribbons the day before the second anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken, she said: ""I actually wasn't aware that it was close to the anniversary."" She added that conversations about the ""oppression of Palestinian people"" should not just stop at 7 October, they should go ""all the way back to 1948"". BBC/Harry Low The yellow ribbons were cut down the day before the second anniversary of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks Speaking about the reaction to her cutting down the ribbons, Ms Yahlom said she had become the subject of a ""targeted hate campaign"". ""I snipped a handful of ribbons from a railing that had been placed in a public park that I use every day in my local community. ""I have been the subject of physical attacks, of a doxing campaign, threats of assault and rape and violence that have been threatened against me and my family on the basis that the people behind that campaign want to silence me."" She said those people were wrongly removing the focus from the loss of life in Gaza. ""It's a deliberate attempt on the part of those who have led this witch hunt against me to do that, to try and shift the focus. ""In what universe do we think that the focus now should be on me cutting down some ribbons and not on liberation for the Palestinian people?"" When asked if she was concerned about accusations of antisemitism, Ms Yahlom said: ""I think it's antisemitic to imply that a Jewish person who is standing in principled opposition to a genocide is driven by hatred. ""I never intended to put myself and my family in this line of fire. But now that I have a platform, I have an opportunity as a Palestinian Jew to say: 'Not in my name.' ""On the way to this interview, I passed by a number of Palestinian flags and stickers calling for Palestinian liberation, speaking out against Israeli apartheid, calling for an end to the genocide, all of which had been ripped down. ""I myself once encountered a woman in Muswell Hill taking down a sticker with a Palestinian flag, I engaged her in discussion about it.  We obviously had very different opinions about what had happened. ""What didn't happen is that I called a mob to attack her, intimidate her, threaten her film her without her consent, and subject her to a ceaseless campaign of physical attacks, threats against her life and threats against her family. ""The community in Muswell Hill was whipped up into a frenzy by frankly irresponsible and sensationalist media reporting [surrounding the ribbon cutting]. ""It is astonishing to me, to see what it means to speak out about genocide. ""That's the difference in what happened when I spoke reasonably to a woman who was taking down a Palestinian flag as opposed to the actions [which followed after the ribbon cutting]."" A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said the case was being investigated as racially aggravated criminal damage and racially aggravated public order offence. ""As part of our thorough investigation, officers will examine all evidence to understand whether the incident was either motivated by hostility towards a racial group, or whether those under suspicion demonstrated such hostility during the reported offence,"" the spokesperson said. The force added it was now also investigating reports of a hate crime on Friday, 10 October and a threats to kill incident on Monday, 6 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ye19w98qxo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4bb5/live/1ce690a0-a750-11f0-8269-d390add37b5e.jpg,2025-10-14T07:29:36.850000+00:00,89b91aa9fd9b84447bfc04ec46234384b7ad67c9
55583d6f8437,Highland summit to tackle devastating impact of wildfires,,"Highland summit to tackle devastating impact of wildfires Scottish Gamekeepers Association More than 200 wildfires have broken out across Scotland this year A multi-agency meeting will be held in the Highlands later to look at the devastating impact of recent wildfires in Scotland. It follows a series of blazes at Carrbridge and Dava in the Cairngorms national park, which landowners described as the biggest in living memory . The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said this year had presented an ""unprecedented"" wildfire risk, with more than 200 incidents across the country. The summit in Grantown, hosted by the Scottish government, will consider ways to improve resilience and prevent future outbreaks. It will be attended by representatives from the SFRS, NatureScotland, Scottish Land and Estates and other land management and environmental groups. The blaze at Dava caused devastation to the landscape and wildlife Scotland's Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie and Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown are joint chairs of the summit. Fairlie said: ""It took an astonishing effort across so many sites to tackle the wildfires we saw this year, and we are grateful to all those who helped. ""This is a chance for us to look at what worked, and what lessons we need to learn from what happened."" Brown said that, in the aftermath of this summer's blazes, ministers had ""engaged closely"" with SFRS, local communities and other groups. She added: ""We continue to support the full implementation of the SFRS wildfire strategy, which will see the continued roll-out of new equipment, vehicles and personal protective equipment."" Large areas of the Highlands were affected by the summer's wildfires What causes wildfires? Water was used to try to douse the fires in the summer The SFRS classifies wildfires as large and uncontrolled outdoor fires exceeding 1,000 sq m of burned area. Wildfires are unplanned and unpredictable. They happen in areas with combustible vegetation that causes flames to spread rapidly. Human activity is often to blame - with fires started by barbecues, glass bottles magnifying sunlight on dry vegetation, or discarded cigarettes. One of the reasons fires continue to burn on moorland is because of peaty soil which fuels the flames. In parts of the Highland landscape the fires penetrated deep, burning away peat that would have formed thousands of years ago. Colin McClean, land manager of the Cairngorms National Park Authority, said it would have a long-lasting impact on the natural environment. He said the park was introducing ""clear, practical measures"" to reduce wildfire risk and said the summit was an opportunity for ""critical conversations"" on mitigation and management. The SFRS said it would continue to work closely with ""partners, landowners and communities in both our response and, importantly, to help prevent wildfires"". SFRS assistant chief officer Jon Henderson added: ""This year Scotland has faced an unprecedented scale of wildfire risk. ""Wildfires can employ a significant amount of our resources, they also have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land and wildlife."" He said the SFRS welcomed the opportunity to participate in the summit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397k791g3do,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/37eb/live/e8fd4c90-a85b-11f0-a6a1-7df40e0558bb.jpg,2025-10-14T05:29:49.072000+00:00,652f9d50f6d2e5fa6c06653b841dd1afa941fa2e
ff526c41236c,Van driver's 'catastrophic' error led to Team GB triathlete's road death,,"Van driver's 'catastrophic' error led to Team GB triathlete's road death Jenny Casterton Producer, The Crash Detectives Family photo Mrs Comins had represented Wales and Great Britain, and was described by Welsh Triathlon as ""a fierce competitor with a positivity and energy that was infectious"" A Team GB triathlete, described as a ""fierce competitor"", was killed as she cycled at speeds close to 30mph (48km/h) because of a ""catastrophic misjudgement"" by a driver who tried to overtake her. Rebecca Comins, 52, was nine minutes into a time trial on the A40 near Raglan, Monmouthshire, when her bike was hit by a van driven by pub owner Vasile Barbu. The 49-year-old said he had seen her, but did not know why he hit her, claiming he would ask himself the question for his ""whole life"". Despite denying causing death by dangerous driving, he was found guilty and jailed for four years , after a Gwent Police investigation filmed by BBC show The Crash Detectives found Mrs Comins was in his field of view for 18 seconds. While Mrs Comins was described as ""a fierce competitor"" by Welsh Triathlon , forensic collision investigator Sgt Cath Raine said: ""She was doing everything that she could to be safe; to be visible. ""An innocent cyclist has paid for that misjudgement with her life."" The crash happened on a bright, sunny Thursday evening in June 2022, the first day of the Platinum Jubilee holiday weekend. A group of cyclists had been waiting patiently for their turn to push off in what was a regular time trial event. The task ahead was to cover 10 miles (16km), as fast as possible, along a section of straight, flat dual carriageway. Mrs Comins was in the saddle of her black Argon 18 TT bike, specifically designed for this type of race. Tucked in tight on the aero handlebars, she achieved speeds close to 30mph (48km/h). She wore a dark-coloured helmet and navy blue clothing, and contrasting with the light-coloured surface of the concrete road, had a bright orange race number on her back. Gwent Police said Mrs Comins was ""doing everything that she could to be safe"" Barbu had by this point left his home in Abergavenny, and was driving his fully-loaded Vauxhall Movano van on the same section of road. In an interview shortly after his arrest, he told police he had seen cyclists gathered in the layby, as he drove at between 60mph (96km/h) and 65mph (105km/h) in lane one. He claimed the van was so heavy, he could not go any faster even if he wanted to. In fact, an examination found it was so crammed full of furniture, it was half a tonne over its permitted weight. Barbu recalled seeing cyclists travelling on the road ahead, and described checking his mirrors and moving ""half into lane one, half into lane two"", to give them space as he passed. As he gained on Mrs Comins, he told officers he specifically remembered the red light on the rear of her bike. It was set to daybright mode - which meant it was flashing irregularly. Vasile Barbu told police during interview that he could not explain how he hit Mrs Comins Barbu began trying to overtake when he was two metres (6.5ft) behind, and demonstrated with his hands to officers how much space he gave. ""And I heard a knock,"" he added. At first, Barbu thought the load had shifted in his van. But as he pulled over and climbed out of the vehicle, he realised his nearside headlight was broken. He then saw the damaged bike and injured rider on the grass verge, and dialled 999. Data from the cycle computer Mrs Comins was using to record her ride revealed she was travelling at 21mph (33.7km/h) when she was struck. The bike's rear wheel took the full force of the impact. Crash investigators determined the speed of the cyclist and van prior to the crash Sgt Raine found a corresponding vertical mark on the front bumper of Barbu's van. This proved he was travelling in line with the upright bike at the point of the collision. But with the driver still failing to provide any plausible explanation, officers took the same model of van back to the scene, to retrace his route. Sgt Raine calculated from his elevated position in the cab, with the sun setting behind, he could have seen at least 500m (1,640ft) of the long, straight road ahead. At a speed of 60mph (96/5km/h), this meant Mrs Comins could have been within his field of view for 18.5 seconds. But further details from the cycle computer showed just how visible she would have been. The altitude and speed revealed she was cycling uphill and accelerating very slightly. ""Because we know that she's going uphill, because we know that she's accelerating, she must have been pedalling,"" Sgt Raine added. ""Pedalling, so biological motion, draws attention. ""It's one of the things that would have made it easier for any driver following her to be able to see that she was there."" With the driver now running out of excuses, he was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Sentencing him, a judge said: ""You could very easily have moved to the outside lane to overtake her as other drivers had. ""You could, and should, have given her far more space and yourself far more time."" He described it as a ""catastrophic decision to overtake at the last second"". New guidance for overtaking cyclists has since been introduced in the Highway Code . It advises leaving at least 1.5 metres (5ft) when doing speeds of up to 30mph.

c44f39e4ffad,Tree planting in NI failing to meet legally binding targets,,"Tree planting in NI failing to meet legally binding targets Louise Cullen BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent BBC John Martin, the Woodland Trust's NI director, said Northern Ireland ""very much needs"" to see tree planting increase Tree planting in Northern Ireland is too slow to meet legally binding targets and thousands of residents are living in ""tree poor"" neighbourhoods, according to the Woodland Trust. The organisation's latest 'State of The UK's Woods and Trees: Northern Ireland' report finds the failure to meet tree planting targets is putting climate action, nature recovery and community wellbeing at risk. Less than 20% of the 2030 target for new woodland has been planted between 2020 and 2024. The report calls for better protection for ancient and long-established woodlands, more investment in forestry skills, better evidence gathering, and prioritisation of tree planting in areas of greatest need. John Martin, director of the Woodland Trust NI, said Northern Ireland ""very much needs"" to see tree planting increase. ""We haven't met those targets and at the minute there is no plan in place to help meet those targets in a way that's efficient to get to 2030. ""The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago, the second-best time is today. ""So we need to get on with this urgently."" Getty Images Just 8.6% of Northern Ireland's land area is wooded Woodlands and trees in Northern Ireland face threats from pests and diseases like ash dieback. Deer, extreme weather exacerbated by climate change, and damage from pollution also threaten trees. Based on 2024 figures, just 1,700 hectares of new woodland have been planted between 2020 and 2024 – less than 20% of the 9,000-hectare 2030 target. Since those figures were collated, an additional 500 hectares has been planted in 2025. That still leaves almost 7,000 hectares to be planted in less than five years – just over 75% of the target. Just 8.6% of Northern Ireland's land area is wooded, compared to 19% in Scotland, 15% in Wales, 11% in the Republic of Ireland, and 10% in England. Ancient woodland -  that can be shown to be ancient with a high degree of certainty - is now extremely rare in Northern Ireland, at just 0.04%. ""We visit probably some of our ancient woodland sites without even knowing they are ancient - some of those trees have been around since the 1600s,"" Mr Martin said. ""They have a very specific biodiversity associated with them - very specific soil, very specific species that exist within there and I think we probably just take that for granted."" The Woodland Trust has called on the Northern Ireland government to support stronger legal protection for the oldest and most significant trees. Post-Brexit uncertainty affecting tree planting Mr Martin said there were ""a range of different reasons"" for the slow pace of tree planting in Northern Ireland, including changes in land use as a result of Brexit. Under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (Cap), landowners received financial incentives if they set aside land for tree planting. Post-Brexit, Mr Martin explained: ""There are still incentives there absolutely, but there is less certainty around what those incentives look like going forward. ""There's also been some delay to those grants going out."" The Woodland Trust NI director added that 75% of land in Northern Ireland is ""managed for agriculture"". ""We're very good at growing grass in Northern Ireland,"" he said, but added: ""We're way behind in terms of tree cover in comparison to other parts of the UK and Europe"". Health and wellbeing impact Urban Tree Canopy Cover (UTCC) averages just over 15% here, which is among the lowest in the UK. That figure drops to less than 10% in many urban areas. Mr Martin said those low levels of tree cover can have a direct impact on people. ""That health and wellbeing element is really important, but also those nature-based solutions - they draw in carbon, they give us shade, they improve water quality, they reduce flood risk. ""All of those things are really important and by increasing our afforestation, we can increase more of those benefits to wider society.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yldgxlw7do,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe09/live/ce815f50-a815-11f0-881e-a7ddfaa732cf.jpg,2025-10-14T05:26:01.519000+00:00,79f97d5e1382a317440c1825168e3b3cc0d060bb

Police said that on Monday morning, a 56-year-old man, armed with a bow and arrows, approached officers at the gate of State House and was ordered to surrender. Instead, he moved forward and shot PC Ramadhan Matanka in the ribs. The policeman was immediately taken to hospital but died while undergoing treatment, according to a police statement. The attack has raised questions about possible security lapses as State House is one of Kenya's most heavily guarded locations. PC Matanka's body is now in a mortuary and there will be a post-mortem later. An investigation is also under way to establish the motive behind the attack. Local media are reporting that the dead policeman had been among those screening vehicles entering State House. The alleged attacker, who had reportedly disguised himself as a homeless person carrying a sack concealing the weapons, was detained following the assault. Video footage, published by Kenyan television channel NTV later on Monday, showed a handcuffed man with visible injuries. He was in a police vehicle and was reportedly being taken to hospital for treatment. The man is expected to appear in court later on Tuesday, local media are reporting. ""The National Police Service condemns this heinous act and commends the officers for their swift response, which prevented further harm,"" police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga said.

d00e72a9d1bf,US shipping chaos: I fear my wedding sari is destroyed,,"US shipping chaos: I fear my wedding sari is destroyed Natalie Sherman Business reporter Janani Mohan/Yagappa Photography Janani Mohan is missing a sari she wore at her wedding in April, which was also worn by her mother Graduate student Nicole Lobo moved back to the US in late August after a year in the UK, shipping 10 boxes of possessions back home to Philadelphia that she expected to arrive within a few days. Six weeks later, she is still waiting for the shipment - and fears it is lost, destroyed by UPS as the company struggles to handle a flood of packages facing new customs and tariff rules. ""It's been horrific,"" says the 28-year-old, who was notified last month that her boxes would be disposed of, leaving her to make frantic phone calls and send emails to try to head off the outcome. It's an ordeal facing many UPS customers since the Trump administration in late August stopped allowing parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without inspection, taxes or tariffs . The decision abruptly made an estimated 4 million packages each day subject to new, more onerous processing and documentation rules. As the influx leads to longer processing times and higher, sometimes unexpected, costs across the industry, some customers of UPS like Nicole, say they fear their packages have been lost in the backlog. ""It's beyond comprehension to me,"" says Janani Mohan, a 29-year-old engineer living in Michigan, who has also spent hours on hold and sent repeated emails since a tracking alert listed a box sent by her parents in India as set for disposal. The parcel held her wedding dress, which had also been worn by her mother, an heirloom sari from her grandmother and wedding photos, among other items. ""I literally cried to them on the phone,"" she says. ""Everything in there is very close to my heart."" Oregon-based Mizuba Tea Co, which has used UPS for more than a decade to import matcha from Japan, has five shipments together worth more than $100,000 held up in processing. The firm has received conflicting alerts about their status, including some saying the items were set for disposal. ""My whole team is basically on scan watch,"" says Lauren Purvis, who runs the business with her family and is now starting to worry about running out of inventory if the limbo continues. ""It's just clear to us that the current importing systems were not prepared to handle the sheer amount of volume and paperwork."" Mizuba Tea Lauren Purvis says her whole team is on ""scan watch"" Importers typically have 10 days after goods enter the US to submit documentation about the goods, pay tariffs and other fees, allowing the package to go to its recipient. But the Trump administration's rapid changes to tariff rules have made it increasingly difficult to meet customs deadlines requirements, say shipping companies like FedEx and UPS, which offer customs services and often act as importers of record. For example, businesses are now responsible for paying tariffs on any steel or aluminium contained in a product , and in many cases vouching for its country of origin - information that many businesses, let alone their shipping companies, do not know. ""Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,"" a UPS spokeswoman said. While acknowledging longer shipping times, the company said it was still successfully clearing more than 90% of international packages within a day of arrival. The spokeswoman said its policy was to contact customers three times before moving to dispose of a package. But seven people interviewed by the BBC, including several businesses responsible for shipping the items, said they had received no word from UPS about issues before seeing the tracking alert that their package would be trashed. FedEx, another major player in the industry, said it does not typically destroy packages, unless directed to do so by the shipper. Nicole, the graduate student, says she has been asked to supply more information about her items, which she did promptly in early September. She did not hear more until seeing the notice about disposal in late September. After the BBC enquired about her package, the tracking information was updated for the first time in weeks to say it was ""on the way"", raising her hopes. Likewise, Janani says the company reached out last week, after the BBC got in touch, for a few more documents and her package now appears to have cleared customs. Swedish Candy Land Daniel and Tobias Johansson, co-founders of Swedish Candy Land, say lost packages have cost their company $50,000 But for businesses, the chaos has already had real costs. Swedish candy exporter Swedish Candy Land says more than 700 packages it sent via UPS to customers in the US in the first few weeks of September have been held up. Co-founder Tobias Johansson says the business switched to FedEx after becoming aware of the problem and its shipments were now arriving without incident, although the process took a few days longer than before . But the lost packages, some of which have been reported destroyed, have cost the firm roughly $50,000 in refunds, not including the expenses they incurred in shipping and brokerage fees. ""That was a big hit for us and we haven't gotten any answers yet for anything,"" says Mr Johansson. Experts say the ripple effects are being felt across the supply chain, even on businesses, like Mizuba, that were not bringing in shipments using the $800 exemption from tariffs, known as de minimis. ""This can be felt pretty much across the board,"" says Bernie Hart, vice president of business development at Flexport, a logistics and customs business. In a call with financial analysts last month, FedEx executives said it had been a ""very stressful period"" for its customers, especially smaller players. ""That is a big headwind,"" chief executive Raj Subramanian said, warning that changes to the trade environment would likely lead to a $1bn hit this year, including $300m in additional expenses as the firm hires and faces other costs related to the new rules. But John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy for the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents many shipping firms, fears the issues may get worse before they get better. Overall trade volumes last month were lower than is typical, in part because many businesses rushed goods into the US early to beat tariffs. ""There's always been this prevailing thought that companies will figure it out,"" he says. ""What we've seen is that is much harder than anyone anticipated.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9zmeerp1xo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f418/live/098df140-a851-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T05:33:52.687000+00:00,8bb5f708c7e088ffdf2dd464ed92f9474bf1f494

""It's the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world, outside of the United States,"" Thomas Kurien, the CEO of Google Cloud, said at an event in capital Delhi on Tuesday, adding that the investment will be spread over the next five years. The announcement comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been asking American companies to prioritise domestic investment. India has emerged as a key destination for AI data centres. The country's low data costs and rapidly growing internet user base have made it a hub for cloud and AI expansion for tech giants. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the facility ""will bring our industry-leading technology to enterprises and users in India, accelerating AI innovation and driving growth across the country"". A formal agreement to finalise the project will be signed on Tuesday, the Andhra Pradesh government said. ""It is a massive leap for our state's digital future, innovation, and global standing,"" said the state's technology minister Nara Lokesh. The project will combine cloud and AI infrastructure with renewable energy systems and an expanded fibre-optic network. The project is part of the Andhra Pradesh government's plan to develop 6GW of data centre capacity by 2029, according to Bloomberg News. Data centres are physical facilities that house the computing and networking equipment that organisations use to collect, process, store, and distribute data. They contain servers, storage systems and network equipment like routers and firewalls, along with the necessary power and cooling systems to operate them.

A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather. Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio. Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai. All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions. This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays. Getty Images Mumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists found In winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours. These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health. During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter. Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours. ""Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,"" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study. Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective. Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions. According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation. LightRocket via Getty Images India's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlight Studies also show that cleaner air could boost India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power millions of homes for a year. But the impact of pollution doesn't stop at solar energy. It also takes a heavy toll on agriculture, causing an estimated 36–50% loss in crop yields - mainly rice and wheat - in the country's most polluted regions, according to Prof Tripathi. India isn't alone in losing sunshine; across the world, rising air pollution and shifting weather patterns have dimmed the skies. A study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics observed that Europe likely experienced reduced sunlight reaching the ground because of air pollution between1970–2009. In Germany, sunshine hours decreased by approximately 11% from 1951 to 1980, attributed to industrial gas emissions and associated cloud formation. Research also showed that stricter clean-air laws in the 1990s led to a rebound in sunshine hours across Europe. China also experienced a significant decline in sunshine hours from the 1960s to the 2000s, primarily due to increased aerosol emissions from rapid industrialisation. Sunshine duration varied across Chinese cities, with some areas experiencing more significant declines due to factors such as air pollution. The good news: scientists say the Earth's surface has gradually been receiving more sunlight since the 1980s - a trend known as global brightening, following decades of dimming. New analysis of satellite data from 1984 to 2018 appears to confirm this, showing the effect is strongest over land and in the Northern Hemisphere, driven mainly by falling aerosols in the 1980s and 1990s and shifts in cloud patterns. The bad news: heavily polluted countries like India are missing out. If the Sun keeps hiding behind smog, India risks running on fumes instead of full power.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5qygr6d5yo,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c8f/live/f485eb30-a4d2-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-13T23:06:44.042000+00:00,ce85bbe925af8eeab400c7cec72982944fd00c04
024c1c999abd,Concerns over monitoring system used by mental health trusts,,"Concerns over monitoring system used by mental health trusts Sophie Hutchinson BBC health correspondent and Stuart Woodward at the Lampard Inquiry BBC Oxevision uses infrared sensors and cameras to monitor patients while they are in their bedrooms The public inquiry into the deaths of at least 2,000 people under the care of mental health services heard ""grave concerns"" about the use of a digital patient monitoring system. The technology, called Oxevision, was used by half of England's mental health trusts and uses infrared sensors and cameras to monitor patients alone in their rooms, sending alerts to staff when it detects signs of distress or abnormal activity. The Lampard Inquiry was told campaigners were concerned the technology had been overly relied upon by staff,  and many patients' experiences of the technology were ""intrusive, undignified, dehumanising and traumatising"". Oxevsion's manufacturer said the system played a critical role in preventing harm, but agreed filming a patient 24 hours a day could possibly ""constitute a very significant invasion of privacy"". 'De-humanising' This week marked the fifth set of hearings overseen by Baroness Lampard as part of England's first public inquiry into mental health deaths. The inquiry aimed to examine why at least 2,000 patients died while being cared for under NHS mental health services in Essex between 2000 and 2023. Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust [EPUT] previously apologised to families at the inquiry. Lampard Inquiry / YouTube Laura Cozens from the company formerly called Oxehealth, which created Oxevision, gave evidence at the start of the fifth set of hearings at the Lampard Inquiry Counsel for the Lampard Inquiry, Nicolas Griffin KC, said Oxevision had proved controversial and had featured in a number of recent inquests. These included patients Michael Nolan and Morgan Rose-Hart , who died in 2022, along with Elise Sebastian, who died in April 2021 . Elise was found unresponsive in her bedroom at the St Aubyn Centre in Colchester. The 16-year-old was supposed to receive one-to-one care, but an inquest was told the Oxevision alert system, linked with her bedroom, was muted and she was left alone for 28 minutes. The coroner was told changes had been made to the alert system by EPUT. Stuart Woodward/BBC The Lampard Inquiry is being held at Arundel House in London How does Oxevision work? Oxevision is a remote monitoring system, which manufacturers said was used in half of all NHS mental health trusts in England, providing in-patient care. Infra-red cameras installed in patients' bedrooms can track their pulse rates by detecting ""micro-blushes"" of the skin - invisible to the naked eye - as well as their breathing rates due to the rise and fall of a patient's chest. A camera can also take images and provide a clean video feed of up to 15 seconds. Alerts and warnings were meant to be sent to staff on computers and tablets in the case of an emergency. Richard Daniel/BBC Bereaved families - pictured outside a previous evidence session - were keen to see changes implemented after the inquiry. In a statement to the inquiry, the campaign group made up of former and current NHS inpatients, Stop Oxevision , said the system had led to serious harm. Their spokesperson, Hat Porter, described it as a ""superficial quick fix for wider systemic issues"" and said many patients' experiences of the technology were ""intrusive, undignified, dehumanising and traumatising"". Their research raised concerns, including significant invasion of privacy, the impact of the technology on patients' health and recovery, and staffing issues. Stop Oxevision is due to appear at the Lampard Inquiry on Tuesday in a pre-recorded evidence session. Getty Images Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Lampard said she was committed to carrying out an investigation that was ""fair, objective, thorough, rigorous and balanced"" Laura Cozens from LIO - the company formerly called Oxehealth, which created Oxevision - said ""the platform may not be suitable for everyone - and we do recognise that"". Asked by Mr Griffin KC, ""Would you agree that filming a patient 24 hours a day constitutes a very significant invasion of privacy?"", Ms Cozens said, ""Possibly, yes"". Ms Cozens added that it was important that the use of the technology was properly communicated to patients, and it had played a critical role in preventing serious incidents, including falls at a dementia ward. She named 1,774 incidents where staff were supported in responding to situations where patients could otherwise have come to some serious harm, adding that the system helped to free up staff time from paperwork. A spokesperson for EPUT said that Oxevision was used by the trust ""to support our staff to better care for our patients on our wards"". ""This is always carried out in conjunction with clear clinical assessment and the consent of our patients."" ""Their safety, care and recovery is our number one priority,"" the spokesperson added.

It is the first squad Sarina Wiegman has selected since England won Euro 2025 in July and there are several key players missing because of injury. But Bronze, 33, has recovered from the fractured tibia she played with during Euro 2025 and was a late substitute in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance this season. Captain Leah Williamson is not in the squad because of a knee injury while Chelsea forward Lauren James also misses out with an ankle issue. Williamson and James have yet to play this season as a result of injuries picked up during Euro 2025. Forward Lauren Hemp is also missing after suffering an ankle injury in Manchester City's win over Tottenham on 19 September. Chelsea captain Millie Bright, 32, retired from international football on Monday after winning 88 caps and Wiegman has called up 19-year-old Arsenal centre-back Katie Reid for the first time. Reid's club-mate Taylor Hinds, who joined Arsenal from Liverpool in the summer, is also included.

Opener KL Rahul hit an unbeaten half-century as India sealed a seven-wicket win on the fifth morning in Delhi. It keeps the hosts third in the early stages of the World Test Championship (WTC) standings, , external behind Australia and Sri Lanka. The win was set up by centuries in the first innings by Yashasvi Jaiswal (175) and Gill (129*).

a20c0f0740fb,Germany defeat 'a missed opportunity' for NI,,"Northern Ireland defender Paddy McNair says Monday's 1-0 defeat by Germany in World Cup qualifying was a ""missed opportunity"". Nick Woltemade's first-half goal, which came off the shoulder of the Newcastle United striker from a corner, was decisive at Windsor Park. Northern Ireland pressed for an equaliser and had chances through Shea Charles, Callum Marshall and Justin Devenny to level. The narrow defeat by Germany leaves Michael O'Neill's side third in Group A but the possibility of a World Cup play-off remains. ""I've played against Germany teams in the past who are much better than them and have better players as well,"" said McNair. ""So I do feel it's a missed opportunity."" The performance of referee Jesus Gil Manzano drew criticism from the home crowd and team, and the Spanish official waved away a last-gasp penalty appeal when Josh Magennis fell in the area at a corner. However, what annoyed NI the most was the decision to add just two additional minutes at the end of the second half - a decision O'Neill called ""ridiculous"". ""I've never seen that in my life. I've played hundreds of games and I've never seen two minutes,"" added McNair. ""I don't know the reason for it. There's six, seven subs, is there? Usually it's, what, 30 seconds per sub, so it should be at least four minutes, shouldn't it?"". San Diego defender McNair says there will always be an element of ""you never know"" but ""we definitely would have had a couple more chances if there was a few more minutes added on"". ""I thought the second half performance was good. They were good first half, to be fair. ""They had a good game plan, and it felt like they switched the game a lot which couldn't really let us press them. ""I thought we definitely took the game to them. We're just so close.

1bcea74188e2,Frankenstein: Why Mary Shelley's 200-year-old horror story is so misunderstood,,"It's perhaps a double-edged sword that the monstrous success of Hollywood's incarnations (notably James Whale's 1931 film starring Boris Karloff as the creature) in many ways secured the story's longevity but somewhat obscured Shelley's version of it. ""Frankenstein [the film] created the definitive movie image of the mad scientist, and in the process launched a thousand imitations,"" Frayling writes. ""It fused a domesticated form of Expressionism, overacting, an irreverent adaptation of an acknowledged classic, European actors and visualisers – and the American carnival tradition – to create an American genre. It began to look as though Hollywood had actually invented Frankenstein."" And so, a movie legend was born. And just as Hollywood cherry-picked from Mary Shelley to cement its version of her story, she had borrowed from historical and Biblical stories to create her own message and mythology. The subtitle of the novel, ""The Modern Prometheus"", recalls the figure of ancient Greek and Latin myth who variously steals fire from the gods and gives it to man, and represents the dangers of overreaching. The novel's other great allusion is to God and Adam, and a quote from Paradise Lost appears in the book's epigraph: ""Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay / To mould me man?"". It is arguably the creature's humanity – and his tragedy – that in his cinematic transformations into a mute but terrifying monster, has often been forgotten. The empathy and humanity that has often been lost at the heart of Shelley's novel is reinstated in the latest adaptation Shelley gave the creature a voice and a literary education in order to express his thoughts and desires (he is one of three narrators in the book). Like The Tempest's Caliban, to whom Shakespeare gives a poetic and poignant speech, the creature's lament is haunting: ""Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."" If the creature is perceived as a misshapen human rather than a monster, his tragedy deepens. He is first rejected by his creator, which Christopher Frayling called ""that post-partum moment"", and is often identified as a parental abandonment. Considering that Mary Shelley had lost her own mother Mary Wollstonecraft at birth, had just buried her own baby girl, and was looking after her pregnant step-sister as she was writing the book – which took exactly nine months to complete – birth (and death) is pertinent. The newborn creature is alienated further as society recoils from him; he is made good , but it is the rejection that creates his murderous revenge. It's a robust allegory for a responsibility to children, outsiders or those who don't conform to conventional ideals of beauty. ""The way that we sometimes identify with Frankenstein – as we've all taken risks, we've all had hubristic moments – and partly with the creature, they are both aspects of ourselves – all our selves"" Fiona Sampson says. ""They both speak to us about being human. And that's incredibly powerful.""",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180611-why-frankenstein-is-the-story-that-defined-our-fears,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0lzyqy4.jpg,2025-10-14T10:01:27.871000+00:00,7673957e60b20700ff4b17898a10484a063969da

Camera crews descended on the famous cul-de-sac last month to film the crossover episode to mark Hollyoaks' 30th anniversary. TV royalty Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson are among the cast reprising their roles for the long-awaited soap's revival. The episode will air on E4 at 19:00 BST on 22 October. Johnston and Tomlinson were joined on set by Brookside favourites including Paul Usher as Barry Grant, John McArdle as Billy Corkhill, Philip Olivier as Timothy ""Tinhead"" O'Leary, Suzanne Collins as Nikki Shadwick and Michael Starke as Thomas ""Sinbad"" Sweeney. Louis Emerick, who played Mick Johnson in Brookside between 1989 and 2001, is currently playing the character of detective Donny Clark in Hollyoaks. He said the episode would be ""fun for the viewers"" as he teased the storyline. ""Well, the character of Froggy Black recently arrived and is rattling Donny's cage because he knows a big secret Donny's been hiding,"" he said. ""All is not as it seems and we can safely say it's connected to the Brookside crossover. ""The house of cards is going to start collapsing."" This will be the first time that Brookside Close has been on air since the final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003.

Police believe the trailer became detached from a Mitsubishi Outlander on Pleasance Avenue at about 15:15 on Monday and struck the pram on the pavement. An 18-year-old woman who was pushing the pram was taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. A driver who stopped to help the children said it was ""the most distressing and horrific thing I have ever seen in my life"".

The Tillbridge Solar project, which would cover around 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares),   is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, meaning the decision to approve the plans is determined by the government. The applicants said the scheme - close to the village of Glentworth and south of the A631 between Gainsborough and Caenby Corner - would be able to power about 300,000 homes, making it larger than any currently built. Opponents have said it would ""industrialise the countryside"". The decision marks the 17th nationally-significant clean energy project approved by the government since July 2024. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: ""Families across Lincolnshire and the rest of the country have seen their energy bills go through the roof as a result of our exposure to volatile gas prices. ""Solar is one of the cheapest and quickest power sources we can build, it is crucial in our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower – giving us energy security, good jobs and growth across the country."" In 2024, the government approved two other major farms in Lincolnshire – Gate Burton in West Lindsey and Mallard Pass in South Kesteven. In an impact report , West Lindsey, the local authority for the Tillbridge project, highlighted ""significant concerns"" regarding the cumulative impact of the scheme. Councillor Tom Ashton, portfolio holder for planning at the neighbouring East Lindsey authority, previously described the project as ""the thin end of the wedge of climate madness"" and said: ""Its scale and mass beggars belief."" Officials in Lincolnshire have also complained that developments have been unfairly concentrated in the county, with one complaining it was becoming a dumping ground for green energy projects that benefits other parts of the country. The Tillbridge project is a joint venture between renewable energy developers Tribus Clean Energy and Recurrent Energy. It would include infrastructure for connection to the National Grid at Cottam substation in Nottinghamshire.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kp40ky8j4o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/68cd/live/bb47e280-a8db-11f0-a522-95977dce8b09.jpg,2025-10-14T10:59:31.528000+00:00,f4f400eeb84f02b6e82562e60a4b06a39fce9a25

And Hatters chief executive Gary Sweet believes that is part of the reason why bringing in former Charlton boss Chris Powell to work alongside Wilshere was necessary. ""Jack went through four stages of interview, with 16 pairs of eyes looking at him, who came to the same conclusion. But we really felt we needed a very experienced number two who could bring a stabilising influence and knowhow,"" he told BBC Three Counties Radio. ""The model is the one we feel is right - where we have energy, enthusiasm, different ideas, nimbleness, boldness, bravery, all of these things - but stabilised by Chris, who will give a tap on the shoulder and a little bit of advice here and there."" Powell himself had no doubts about accepting his role after learning that Wilshere was the man Luton wanted. ""He's a young coach, he's modern, progressive, and his understanding - based on the discussions we've had - he gets it already,"" Powell said. ""Everyone thinks you have an idea of the way you want to play and you do it straight away. No, you've got to be understanding of the situation, of where the team's at, what league you're in and what's required. ""Then, over time, you drip-feed your principles and your concept of what you want to see every time the team plays - he understands that and I think my role will be to help him, support him, facilitate what's needed alongside the other staff.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjd0kmglmxzo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/4f1c/live/11a6f360-a8e0-11f0-a522-95977dce8b09.jpg,2025-10-14T10:47:51.277000+00:00,1c89bb731178a5a3f9c4607e54d936a541ea3af1

Dan Howell and Phil Lester have amassed millions of followers, hosted a BBC Radio 1 show, published best-selling books, and been on world tours. Many of the British pair's comedy and gaming videos show them in the house they share, and they separately came out as gay in 2019, but they hadn't directly spoken about their relationship. ""We fell into it hard and fast in 2009, and here we are almost 16 years later,"" Dan said in the new video , telling followers they ""can't live in fear any more"". They shared the best vlogger prize at the Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2016 The couple spoke about the impact of intrusion and intense speculation from fans, which Dan said ""could have killed me"". He also explained it had taken time to discuss the relationship publicly because of the effects of his ""extremely homophobic childhood"", which meant he had been ""deep in the closet"" for years. ""In my mid 20s I felt we had to hide the relationship because I was still hiding who I was to my friends, family, myself,"" he said. ""This is why all of the digging from people online hit a nerve, because Phil was my safe space. You were my first boyfriend... You were a literal ray of light in my life back then."" Dan & Phil take on Taylor Swift in an art challenge at the Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2013 Dan continued: ""And what we had was the most important thing to me and I wanted to protect it, so when other people tried to grab it and drag it into the light, I felt completely violated. ""Having all of these people trying to out us, and being so hostile to me when I tried to hide it, was so triggering. Honestly, it could have killed me."" Dan added that he felt like someone had put a curse on them, with them achieving huge success ""but half the time it's going to suck for years, wake up in the night with anxiety, you're going to have panic attacks"". He said there were times when he thought he might be ""happier without all of this"". ""Yeah, [in] 2017 I'm thinking, my solo comedy content is killing it on YouTube, this could just be my life. I could be like every other YouTube boy and just enjoy this without the apocalyptic, constant stress of this Dan and Phil dating conspiracy."" 'A cycle of never-ending closets' He said he had decided to make the relationship public after a recent therapy session. ""My therapist said, 'Dan, you love being in the closet'. And I was like, 'Excuse me?'"" He continued: ""I spent so long not being authentic and being trapped in a situation, that I am comfortable being miserable in an environment where I don't do the thing that would suddenly make me feel better. I am in a cycle of never-ending closets, and this secret conspiracy is just another thing that I'm trapped inside."" Phil added that some followers may have already guessed, but making the announcement was ""a big scary deal for us, it's kind of like another mini coming out"". He acknowledged that the move may attract more homophobia. ""Look, sure, this is a scary time in the world,"" Dan replied. ""Let's be real, it feels like things are sliding backwards because the fighting for what was important was going a bit too well. ""But I think that's why it's more important than ever that we're like, 'You know what? Hey, here we are, gay. And what?'""

The singer welcomed twins Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster in May with musician Zion Foster, who she got engaged to last month. Nelson said in an Instagram post that becoming a mother made her ""realise how incredible my body actually is"". Alongside images of herself in her underwear holding her daughters, she wrote: ""33 years of extreme diets, 33 years of putting myself down wishing my belly was flatter, wanting my waist just a little smaller and almost going through with a boob job, to now standing here having this photo taken."" She continued: ""I can honestly say I've never felt prouder of my body and what it has been through! Yes my boobs hang lower and my belly is bigger and squishier - it doesn't look how it used to, but my god it created the best gift that has ever happened to me. ""If there's anything I've learned over the past nine months of being pregnant, it's that I never want my girls to feel the way I did about my body for so many years. ""So to all the future mummies or the mummies that have just given birth, if you're struggling with how you are feeling in yourself or are maybe even feeling the pressure to ""snap back"" just take a moment to remember what YOU did! Be kinder to yourself and remember you are INCREDIBLE!!!"" Nelson, 34, gave birth to her twins prematurely at 31 weeks, having previously revealed she had experienced rare complications during the pregnancy. In March, she said she had undergone a ""successful"" operation to prevent complications related to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The condition is caused by abnormal connecting blood vessels in the twins' placenta which leads to an imbalanced blood flow from one twin, known as the donor, to the recipient twin, leaving one baby with a greater blood volume than the other. Shortly after the surgery in March, Nelson said: ""The TTTS has cleared up, the operation was a success, which is just absolutely incredible. We are so, so lucky to have the most amazing doctors."" She also revealed her twins were monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), meaning they share a single placenta but have their own separated amniotic sacs. Nelson left Little Mix in December 2020 , saying she needed to protect her mental health. She later explained that online abuse - an issue she explored in a 2019 BBC Three documentary - had left her at ""breaking point"". Since leaving the band, Nelson has released music as a solo artist, including the single, Boyz, featuring Nicki Minaj, in 2021. Little Mix, also featuring Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall, formed on the X Factor in 2011. The group went to record multiple UK top 10 albums and five number one singles, with hits such as Wings, Black Magic and Shout Out to My Ex.

Fayaz Khan, 26, made a gun gesture with his hand, pointed to an AK-47 tattoo on his face and named the Reform UK leader in a TikTok post in October 2024. Authorities believed the Afghan migrant had given them a false name and he was actually a 31-year-old called Fayaz Husseini, Southwark Crown Court heard. Farage described the threat as ""pretty chilling"", adding: ""Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried."" In the video, Khan pointed towards his face tattoo and said he was going to ""pop, pop, pop"" the MP for Clacton, in Essex, referring to him as ""Englishman Nigel"". Sentencing him, judge Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""Your video was not more abuse, it was a threat to kill with a firearm and it was, as Mr Farage put it, 'pretty chilling'."" Khan was one of 65 migrants on board a black inflatable boat that entered the UK by crossing the English Channel. ""The defendant livestreamed the recording of his crossing, which appears to have gathered a large online viewing,"" said prosecutor Peter Ratliff. The court heard Khan gave a false name because he had ""enemies he did not want to find him"". However, the prosecution said it was ""more likely"" he had given misleading details due to his criminal record while living in Sweden. Mr Ratliff also disputed Khan's claim that he was unaware it was illegal to arrive in the UK by small boat. He claimed Khan ""intended to encourage others"" by documenting his journey from Sweden to the UK, sharing it with hundreds of thousands of viewers online. The court was told Khan had 17 previous convictions in Sweden, including for carrying a knife, threatening behaviour and vandalism. Khan was also jailed in June 2019 after using threatening behaviour towards a public servant. On 12 October 2024, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube entitled ""the journey of an illegal migrant"", which showed Khan and referenced ""young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little"". Jurors in Khan's trial were told he responded with a TikTok video under the username ""madapasa"" two days later, threatening Farage.

0ea044053634,French PM backs suspending Macron's pension reform in bid to save government,,"French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week. The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency. ""This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,"" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties. Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive. Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as ""censure"" votes in Lecornu, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections. The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes. ""If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,"" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV. ""He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week."" The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term. There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a ""wound on democracy"" . On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be ""compensated by other savings,"" Lecornu said. Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil. Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkldd02xg8o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0586/live/bed91100-a906-11f0-99b2-a3801a157d90.jpg,2025-10-14T14:25:45.877000+00:00,f9e2bb3a15f2d9fb06af0408ad7a5938e4f4755b

Belgium's three big unions are protesting over pensions and other measures by Prime Minister Bart de Wever's centre-right government aimed at cutting the budget deficit. There were no services at Belgium's second biggest airport at Charleroi, and all departures and many of the arrivals were cancelled at Brussels Airport. Although trains were running, most buses, trams and underground trains in the capital ground to a halt. Shipping at Europe's second biggest port Antwerp was suspended until Wednesday because of understaffing, and more than 100 ships waited in the North Sea for permission to dock at three ports, according to Belgium's MDK maritime and coastal services. Belgium has been hit by several strikes since Flemish nationalist Bart de Wever came to office last February. By midday, police said 80,0000 protesters had joined the demonstration in the Belgian capital. Bruno Boelpaep/BBC The unions were expecting more than 100,000 Belgians to join the Brussels protest Public sector workers were protesting against austerity measures and a government increasingly perceived as leaning right. They wound through the streets of central Brussels, many wearing the red or green colours of the main unions. A key issue for the unions is the government's plan to increase the number of days Belgians work per year before they can receive their pensions, as well as the end of special schemes for several sectors including military and railway workers. De Wever's government has also announced measures including a maximum two-year limit on claiming unemployment benefit. Further cuts are planned for next year's budget, and some proposals such as reducing child benefit or raising VAT have already been floated. ""It's about time we came together,"" said Anaïs, 29. ""It's always the same part of the population that has to tighten their belts."" Bruno Boelpaep/BBC Anaïs complained that the government's pension reforms would not affect wealthier Belgians Holding a placard showing the number 67 with a red line through it, she objected to the pension age going up: ""65 is enough. 67 is too late. We are asked to work more, to work longer hours. It's not fair."" The rise in pension age was adopted 10 years ago, well before De Wever's government came to office, but it remains deeply unpopular and the government is aiming to ringfence it and make it more expensive to retire earlier. Thierry Bodson of the ABVV union told demonstrators that ""the fight against the De Wever government is not just the fight of a day or a year - it's for a whole generation"", Belga news agency reported. ""We need to fight for our rights,"" said mother-of-two Vanessa, who had travelled from Charleroi. ""I'm worried about the measures that will be taken. What sort of future will my children have?"" she told the BBC. It is not just the federal government under pressure to cut spending. Belgium's complex multi-level governance means regional authorities are also imposing austerity measures. The ruling coalition in Belgium's largely French-speaking Walloon region has announced that teachers in the higher tiers of secondary schools will have to work an extra two hours per week. Many of them joined the protests today.

c11f61e4d3e5,Blast kills three police officers trying to evict siblings from house in Italy,,"Three police officers have been killed and at least 15 other people injured in an apparently deliberate gas explosion at a farmhouse in northern Italy. The blast was triggered as police and firefighters went into the house near Verona to carry out an eviction order for two brothers and a sister in their late 50s and mid-60s. The three victims who died were members of the Carabinieri military police. A man and a woman were arrested at the scene and another man who fled after the explosion was located soon after. All three have been taken to hospital. The blast could be heard some 5km (3 miles) away and images from the scene showed the building reduced to a pile of rubble. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said the farmhouse was subject to an eviction order due to debts accrued by the three owners. ""This is a time for grieving,"" said Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who added that attempts had been made to evict the three siblings in the past. ""It was clear we were dealing with people who would resist in some way,"" he said. Mediators had been sent to speak to the siblings who had barricaded themselves into the house. When the Carabinieri arrived shortly after 03:00 (01:00 GMT), officials believe one of the siblings triggered the blast. ""Upon entering the house, we were confronted with an act of absolute madness,"" provincial police commander Claudio Papagno told the Ansa news agency. ""A gas cylinder had been ignited, and the explosion directly hit our officers,"" he said. Petrol bombs were also found at the property, the interior minister said. Those injured by the blast included 11 other members of the Carabinieri and well as three members of Italy's state police and a firefighter, Ansa reported. According to the Verona prosecutor, Raffaele Tito, the farmhouse was in a derelict state and had no electricity. The prosecutor believed the blast had taken place on a floor above the entrance and told reporters it was a ""premeditated and voluntary homicide"". Shortly before the explosion, he said officers had ""heard a whistle, probably the gas cylinders being opened"". ""We all knew the situation was dire,"" neighbours told Italian media, adding that the three had previously threatened to ""blow themselves up"" rather than leave the house. Piantedosi said the explosion had left a ""terrible, very painful and dramatic toll"". Defence Minister Guido Crosetto joined other political leaders in paying tribute to the three men who had lost their lives in the service of their country.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1jkl09xeo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a516/live/f306f190-a8de-11f0-a522-95977dce8b09.jpg,2025-10-14T09:58:53.933000+00:00,0a5f63c7fd929d7976bde7bd07e8a91d539fac43
aa504bde735a,How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump,,"How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump Ione Wells South America Correspondent BBC Buenos Aires, September 2023. Hundreds of people crowded around to wave flags and film on their phones. The man with unruly hair and sideburns in the centre of them, clad in a black leather jacket, hoisted a roaring chainsaw above his head. This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit. The candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina's entire annual economic output. Rather than 'trimming the fat', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as ""la casta"" - the caste. Getty Images Javier Milei's election rallies featured an unusual prop Milei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a ""libertarian superhero"" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a ""template"" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as ""my favourite president"". They will meet in Washington on Tuesday. Reuters Donald Trump has described Milei as 'my favourite president' - they are due to meet at the White House later today Foreign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei's meeting will hail the deal. Yet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei's reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes. ""He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by 'la casta' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen,"" says Mercedes D'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate. But, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. ""The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste."" Reuters Milei's reforms have prompted heated protests Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession. Milei has created a paradox. On paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains? Argentines feeling the cost Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. ""We're all going backwards economically,"" he says. ""I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees."" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. Now, Mr Sobol says he can't afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he's deciding what his family will have to go without too. Shutterstock For all the international praise since Milei was sworn in (pictured), this is just one side of the story Argentina's multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes ""daily"" closures and job losses. Unlike Trump's approach of raising tariffs to promote ""America First"", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports. ""I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field,"" Mr Galfione argues. He believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. ""Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more."" Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes. And yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines. 'Everything was a huge mess' In the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts. As well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. ""The demand for public spending was brutal,"" argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei. ""Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending."" EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Opponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable income Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight. ""Everything was a huge mess,"" explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria. ""People felt money slipping like water through their fingers."" For many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell. EPA/Shutterstock Milei's supporters credit him with taming Argentina's previously rampant inflation 'Echoes of Thatcherism' When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was ""brilliant."" Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having ""echoes of Thatcherism"". Miguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei's economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. ""When you bear in mind the starting point, that's a huge accomplishment,"" he says. Reuters Javier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret Thatcher He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. But Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case. The outsider advantage Javier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina's Congress. ""Being so detached kind of shields him,"" Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of ""signs of empathy in public life"". On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt. EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Some observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cuts Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in ""people's real lives"". ""We're going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina's infrastructure."" Flawed leader or model for other countries? Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to ""break"" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. ""Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back,"" says Mr Boggiano. ""I think Milei will become a model for other countries."" Others are unsure. ""There is some stability which helps things not to explode,"" said Mr Cibils. ""But I think that stability is also a mirage."" Milei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country's reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn't crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. One former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei's strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can't pay its debts. ""If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it's a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed,"" says the economist. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending. Getty Images Buenos Aires governor Axel Kicillof has been touted as a future presidential candidate As to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for. Many workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net. Meanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a ""normalisation"". But even as leaders abroad watch Milei's experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it. If normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the 'macro' successes. ""He has no political expertise, and I think you need it,"" Prof Rapetti argues. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: ""We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.""

Japan's biggest brewer was forced to pause operations at most of its 30 factories in the country after a cyber-attack late last month disrupted everything from beer shipments to its accounting system. All of Asahi's facilities have now partially reopened and restarted production but computer systems remain down, meaning orders are being processed using pen, paper and fax machines. In a statement on Tuesday, Asahi said it was investigating whether personal information was stolen in the attack. The company said its Emergency Response Headquarters were working with cybersecurity experts to ""restore the system as quickly as possible"", and will contact those affected by the hack. ""As we continue investigating the extent and details of the impact, focusing on the systems targeted in the recent attack, we have identified the possibility that personal information may have been subject to unauthorised data transfer,"" it said. ""Should the investigation confirm this, we will promptly notify those concerned and take appropriate measures in accordance with applicable laws on the protection of personal information."" It remains unclear what personal information was stolen, and Asahi declined to provide more detail as the matter is currently under investigation. Asahi Group also owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Grolsch, and Pilsner Urquell. But Asahi said only its systems and operations in Japan - which account for around half of its sales - have been affected by the attack. Asahi apologised for ""any difficulties"" caused by the incident. The company also said it would delay the disclosure of its third-quarter financial results, citing the disruption caused by the attack. The disclosure would be more than 45 days after the end of the October to December quarter, Asahi said, but when exactly would depend on the progress of restoring its system. Russia-based ransomware group Qilin claimed responsibility for the attack, which has previously hacked other big organisations, including the NHS. The cyber-attack is the latest to have hit operations at major firms. Jaguar Land Rover, Marks and Spencer, and Co-op are among the major British companies that have been affected this year.

Shortly after landing in the United States, the pro-democracy activist called for the release of hundreds of political prisoners held in Cuba. Earlier this month, the 55-year-old revealed that he had taken the ""difficult decision"" to go into exile after being told his wife could also be jailed and their son sent to an institution for juvenile offenders. In a statement, the Cuban foreign ministry said Mr Ferrer and his family had left the country following ""a formal request"" from the US government and insisted that Mr Ferrer had given his ""explicit acceptance"". As co-ordinator of the Patriotic Union of Cuba - an umbrella group of dissident organisations - Mr Ferrer has been one of the most outspoken critics of Cuba's Communist government, which bans political opposition. Like many Cuban dissidents, Mr Ferrer has been in and out of prison. He had been released briefly in January following a deal negotiated by the Vatican under which then US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, just days his term ended. But Mr Ferrer was re-arrested after three months, during which he had continued to speak out against the Cuban government, which accused him of breaching the terms of his parole. The dissident said that following his re-arrest ""the cruelty of the dictatorship towards me has known no bounds"". He has accused prison authorities of humiliating and torturing him. Fellow dissidents have described his departure from Cuba as a ""forced exile"". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said in a statement that ""Ferrer's leadership and tireless advocacy for the Cuban people was a threat to the regime, which repeatedly imprisoned and tortured him"". ""We are glad that Ferrer is now free from the regime's oppression,"" Rubio added. He also called on the international community ""to join us in holding the Cuban regime accountable for its abuses"" and to demand the release of ""more of 700 unjustly detained political prisoners"" held on the Communist-run island.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykwd9e256o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72f4/live/0b99f2d0-a8de-11f0-a522-95977dce8b09.jpg,2025-10-14T11:10:24.583000+00:00,f8170090fc916976530a4f905150d1225936512d
d5239a78136c,What happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?,,"What happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release? Reuters Armed Palestinian fighters pictured ahead of a handover of hostages in Gaza The leaders of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar have joined US President Donald Trump in signing a commitment to implement his plan to end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It came at the end of a day that saw Hamas hand over all 20 living hostages it was holding in Gaza in exchange for the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails. Hamas also handed over the bodies of four deceased hostages. Israel says the remains of 24 others remain in Gaza and must be returned without delay under the ceasefire agreement. The first phase of Trump's plan saw the ceasefire come into effect at 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on 10 October and increased amounts of humanitarian aid enter the Strip. Israeli troops also pulled back to a line that has left them in control of 53% of Gaza - the first of three stages of Israeli withdrawal, according to the Trump plan. Here's what we know. What happens now? Two elements in the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan remain incomplete - the entry of aid into Gaza without restrictions, including the reopening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, and the handover of all deceased hostages. Israel said it received the remains of four hostages on 13 October. However, it has said there are another 24 bodies still in Gaza and the deadline for returning them passed at 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) the same day. ""We demand that Hamas uphold its part of the agreement,"" an Israeli official said, adding the Israeli military ""will not rest until all return to their families and to burial in Israel"". A copy of the ceasefire agreement published by Israeli media last week appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions might not be able to locate all of the bodies within that time frame. An Israeli official meanwhile said an international task force would start work to locate the remains of anyone who was not returned. Once agreement is reached on the completion of phase one, negotiations over the second phase will begin. The 20-point plan, which you can read in full here , says that if it is agreed by both sides, the war would ""immediately end"". A multinational force of around 200 troops overseen by the US military will monitor the ceasefire, according to a senior American official, who added no US forces will be on the ground in Gaza. It also says Gaza will be initially governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a ""Board of Peace"" headed and chaired by Trump. Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms. According to the plan, Hamas - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly. The plan says Gaza will be demilitarised and all ""military, terror and offensive infrastructure"" will be destroyed. What are the key sticking points? There are likely to be multiple points of contention during the negotiations over later phases of the deal. Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established. The group also made no mention of disarming in its initial response to Trump's plan, fuelling speculation that its position had not changed. And though Israel agreed to Trump's plan in full, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to push back on the Palestinian Authority being involved in a post-war Gaza, even as he stood on the podium next to its president. Hamas also said it expected to have some future role in Gaza as part of ""a unified Palestinian movement"". Another sticking point is the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal. Israel says its first withdrawal will see it retaining control of around 53% of Gaza. The White House plan indicates further withdrawals to around 40% and then 15%. That final stage would be a ""security perimeter"" that would ""remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat"". The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas is likely to want clarity on. Israeli troops say they have withdrawn to a line that leaves them in control of 53% of Gaza Who are the released hostages? The ceasefire deal says Hamas should release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza after two years of war. All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On 13 October, Hamas handed 20 living hostages in two groups to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Israeli authorities said the first group comprised Eitan Mor, Gali Berman, Ziv Berman, Omri Miran, Alon Ohel, Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Matan Angrest. The second group was made up of Bar Kupershtein, Evyatar David, Yosef-Chaim Ohana, Segev Kalfon, Avinatan Or, Elkana Bohbot, Maxim Herkin, Nimrod Cohen, Matan Zangauker, David Cunio, Eitan Horn, Rom Braslabski and Ariel Cunio. Hamas said the bodies of four were sent back to Israel on 13 October - those of Guy Illouz, Yossi Sharabi, Bipin Joshi and Daniel Peretz. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it had confirmed the identities of the four hostages and named two of them as Guy Illouz and Bipin Joshi. Who are the Palestinian prisoners and detainees who have been released? In exchange for the hostages, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The list of prisoners published by the Hamas-run Prisoners Media Office did not include high profile figures serving multiple life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis - including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat - whose release Hamas had demanded. The Palestinian Prisoners' Society said 88 prisoners were released in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, eight were released in Gaza, and 154 of the prisoners were deported to an unspecified destination. The ICRC said it had facilitated the return of 1,809 Palestinian detainees to Gaza and the West Bank on 13 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqx7ygq41o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6d25/live/6026e230-a826-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-14T12:27:36.730000+00:00,3d3995aee2d93fad914888578e3896cb79720836
529fca16face,Why AI is being trained in rural India,,"Why AI is being trained in rural India Priti Gupta Technology Reporter, Mumbai NextWealth India's Virudhunagar is home to ancient temples Virudhunagar, a town in southeastern India, can boast temples that date back thousands of years. But not far from those ancient sites, people are working on the latest tech - artificial intelligence. One of those is Mohan Kumar. ""My role is in AI annotation. I collect data from various sources, label it, and train AI models so they can recognize and predict objects. Over time, the models become semi-supervised and can make decisions on their own,"" he says. India has long been a centre for outsourced IT support, with cities like Bangalore or Chennai being traditional hubs for such work. But in recent years firms have been moving that work into much more remote areas, where costs for staff and space are lower. The trend is know as cloud farming, and AI has given it another boost with numerous towns, like Virudhunagar, hosting firms working on AI. So does Mr Kumar think he is missing out, by not being in a big city? ""Professionally, there is no real difference. Whether in small towns or metros, we work with the same global clients from the US and Europe, and the training and skills required are the same,"" says Mr Kumar. Mohan Kumar Mohan Kumar prepares data used to train AI models Mr Kumar works for Desicrew. Founded in 2005 it was a pioneer in cloud farming. ""We realised that instead of forcing people to migrate to cities in search of jobs, we could bring jobs to where people already live,"" says Mannivannan J K, the chief executive of Desicrew . ""For too long, opportunities have been concentrated in cities, leaving rural youth behind. Our mission has always been to create world-class careers closer to home, while proving that quality work can be delivered from anywhere."" Desicrew does all sorts of outsourced work including software testing for start-up firms, building datasets to train AI, and moderating content. At the moment 30 to 40% of its work is AI related, ""but very soon, it will grow to 75 to 100%,"" says Mr J K. Much of that work is transcription - turning audio to text. ""Machines understand text far better,"" he explains. ""For AI to work naturally, machines must be trained to understand variations in how people speak. That's why transcription is such a crucial step, it forms the foundation for machines to comprehend and respond across languages, dialects, and contexts."" Doing such work in a smaller town is not a disadvantage, Mr J K says. ""People often assume rural means underdeveloped, but our centres mirror urban IT hubs in every way – secure data access, reliable connectivity, and uninterrupted power. The only difference is geography. "" Around 70% of his workforce are women: ""For many, this is their first salaried job, and the impact on their families is transformative – from financial security to education for their children,"" says Mr J K. NextWealth Around 60% of NextWealth staff are women Founded in 2008, NextWealth was also an early mover in cloud farming. Headquartered in Bangalore, it employs 5,000 staff in 11 offices in smaller towns across India. ""Sixty percent of India's graduates come from small towns, but most IT companies hire only from the metros. That leaves behind a huge untapped pool of smart, first-generation graduates,"" says Mythily Ramesh, co-founder and managing director of NextWealth. ""Many of these students are first-generation graduates. Their parents are farmers, weavers, tailors, policemen - families who take loans to fund their education,"" she says. NextWealth started with outsourced work from the back offices of big companies, but five years ago moved into artificial intelligence. ""The world's most advanced algorithms are being trained and validated in India's small towns,"" says Ms Ramesh. Around 70% of its work comes from the US. ""Every AI model, from a ChatGPT-like system to facial recognition, needs vast amounts of human-labelled data. That is the backbone of cloud-farming jobs."" She thinks there is plenty more work to come. ""In the next 3–5 years, AI and GenAI will create close to 100 million jobs in training, validation, and real-time handling. India's small towns can be the backbone of this workforce."" She is hopeful that India can remain a hub for such work. ""Countries like the Philippines may catch up, but India's scale and early start in AI sourcing gives us a five to seven-year advantage. We must leverage it before the gap narrows,"" she says. KS Viswanathan is a technology advisor, and formerly worked at India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, the trade association for outsourcing firms. ""Silicon Valley may be building the AI engines, but the day-to-day work that keeps those engines reliable increasingly comes from India's cloud farming industry,"" he says. ""We are truly at a tipping point. If cloud farming continues to scale, small-town India could well become the world's largest hub for AI operations, just as it became the hub for IT services two decades ago."" But success is not guaranteed. While Next Wealth and Desicrew both say they have access to reliable and secure internet connections, Mr Viswanathan says that is not always the case in India's smaller towns. ""Reliable high-speed internet and secure data centres are not always at par with metros, which makes data protection a constant concern."" Even if good connections are in place, work needs to be done to reassure clients. ""The bigger challenge is the perception rather than a technical one. International clients often assume small towns cannot meet data security standards, even when the systems are robust. Trust has to be earned through delivery."" Back at NextWealth, Dhanalakshmi Vijay ""fine-tunes"" AI. For example, if it confuses two similar looking items, like a blue denim jacket and a navy shirt, she will correct the model. ""These corrections are then fed back into the system, fine-tuning the model so that the next time it sees a similar case, it performs better. Over time, the AI model builds up experience, just like updating software with regular patches to make it more accurate and reliable,"" says Ms Vijay. Such work has an effect in the real world. ""It's me and team who indirectly train the AI models to make your online shopping experience easy and hassle free,"" she says.

76763195a8b0,Questions over mysterious death in mental health hospital,,"Questions over mysterious death in mental health hospital James Melley Senior Social Affairs Producer Family photo Maria Morris's family says they still have questions about what led to her death A mental health trust says it is planning to install CCTV following the death of a patient in mysterious circumstances. Maria Morris, 44, was found unresponsive at Bethlem Hospital in south London on 21 September 2021 with four socks down her throat, and a large unexplained bruise on her back. She died hours later in hospital from a brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen. A consultant who treated her questioned whether she had been assaulted. An inquest jury at South London Coroners' court concluded that her death was accidental, but her family says they still have questions about what led to her death. Large bruise on her back The inquest heard that Maria Morris, who worked as a teaching assistant, had bi-polar affective disorder. In September 2021, her family and friends became concerned when she started acting erratically and found that she had stopped taking her medication. Police were called after she ran away from a friend while walking in a park. When found, she was delusional and taken to Croydon Hospital. She was transferred to Bethlem Royal Hospital, a mental health hospital run by South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM), on 18 September where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The jury was told that while Maria was on the unit, she raised a number of concerns about how staff were treating patients. She told one member of staff that patients were being ""punished"" at night. On the evening of the 21 September, Maria was observed by staff in her room at 20:00 and then again at 20:30. At 21:23, a member of staff found her unconscious on the floor of her room, having had a cardiac arrest. During attempts to resuscitate her, a sock was found in her throat. When paramedics arrived, three further socks were removed from her throat. By the time she was transferred to Croydon University Hospital, she had suffered a hypoxic brain injury. A few hours later she went into cardiac arrest again and died on 22 September. The jury was told that Dr Simon Wood, an intensive care doctor at Croydon Hospital who treated Maria, alerted the police to a large bruise on her back. He also said that, in his view, a patient wouldn't have been able to push socks down their own throat without gagging. He was concerned that this may have indicated she'd been assaulted. The jury heard that there was no CCTV used on the wards at Bethlem Hospital and there was nothing in Maria's notes or observations to explain the bruising. Maria's room was locked when she was found. The court heard that most patients had keys for their own rooms, but there was no record on who had what key. Staff had master keys that could unlock all the patients' rooms. Untested blood In a statement read to the court, Metropolitan police officer DC Herdeep Jugdev said that his investigation had been hindered because Maria's room in Bethlem had been cleared, and the sock disposed of, before they got there 19 hours after her death was reported. During their investigation, the police spotted what appeared to be blood under Maria's nails, although this did not appear to have been tested to see whose it was. John Taylor, the South London Coroner, told the jury that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Maria was assaulted on the ward, or that someone else had pushed socks into her airway. The inquest heard conflicting evidence from staff at Bethlem about how often Maria was checked on the night she died. Some documents and witnesses suggested she should have been checked four or five times an hour. Others suggested she should have been checked once an hour. The jury concluded that Maria had pushed the socks down her own throat, but that her death had been accidental. They were unable to reach a conclusion on whether a lack of observations contributed to her death, because of the conflicting evidence. 'Immense pain' In a statement, Maria's family said she was a much-loved mother, daughter and sister, and that her death ""has left a profound and lasting void in the hearts of her family and all who loved her"". ""We are grateful to the jury for having identified that there were missed opportunities around communication, documentation and observations. ""As a family, the idea that more could have been done to keep her safe causes us immense pain."" The family also said it felt the jury was not allowed to comment on all the issues it considered to be important. ""As a family we still have questions about exactly what happened that night.""

5bfd84443060,Australia's team is their worst since 2010 - Broad,,"Broad retired from playing after the Ashes series in England in 2023, when Australia retained the urn with a 2-2 draw. He added: ""You wouldn't be outlandish in thinking - it's actually not an opinion, it's a fact - it's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won, and it's the best English team since 2010. ""So those things match up to the fact it's going to be a brilliant Ashes series."" The first Test starts in Perth on 21 November and Australia's preparations have been hit by the potential absence of skipper Cummins, who has not played since July because of lumbar bone stress in his back. The pace bowler is still recovering from the injury and has said he is ""less likely than likely"" to play in the opener. His absence would leave Australia with a bowling attack of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Scott Boland, who are all in their mid-30s, with their other seamers inexperienced or untried at Test level. The packed Ashes schedule - five Tests in seven weeks - also means both sides will be tested by injuries. ""Australia have been so consistent for a long period of time that you just knew who was going to open the batting, who was going to bat where, what bowlers there were - and they don't have that,"" said Broad. ""It's very much a similar situation to 2010-2011 when England went and won there. ""The fact of the matter is Australia generally have to be bad to lose in Australia and England have to be very good. ""England have a great chance of being very good and Australia have a decent chance of being bad. ""I don't think anyone could argue that it's their weakest team since 2010... it's just a fact.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c9wvjw58gvlo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/0bed/live/343d6640-a8ed-11f0-9bab-b90fd9fb55c6.jpg,2025-10-14T11:35:52.961000+00:00,a4e8dabed581465d77ab6095ba5437acd20bc832

""When she was 11 she went to Jersey with her mum and I remember her beating top women's player Lisa Ashton and me,"" Hedman told BBC Sport. ""Even then, I knew she was someone very special."" Hedman was the first woman to beat a man in a televised major when she defeated Aaron Turner in the 2005 UK Open and says Greaves can compete at the highest level. ""I do believe Beau will do some damage. Some men do not like playing women even in this day and age as there's more pressure,"" she said. ""Whether she will ever win one of the big majors remains to be seen. She has the game to beat them. ""And she's such a sweet down-to-earth lady from a lovely family. You couldn't find a nicer young person. ""Within darts there is always going to be back-biting, jealousies but what you see from Beau is what you get and she has time for everyone, whoever you are."" World number one Humphries has been among those to praise Greaves, who made history in February as the first woman to reach the fourth round of the UK Open where she led him 7-5 before eventually losing 10-7. ""I think she's an amazing player and she deserves it,"" Humphries said during his run to Sunday's World Grand Prix final. ""I predict that she'll flourish playing in it [PDC Pro Tour]. ""She's been a really great player on the secondary tours this year. She's good on the challenge tour, good on the development tour and she'll be a real threat going forward for all the players. Not just for me but for everyone. ""I think she'll do really well. If she's relaxed and she's got no pressure on her shoulders yes, I believe she will be top 64 within the two years for sure."" Greaves will face defending champion Gian van Veen of the Netherlands in the youth final at Minehead in November.

Raducanu has played 50 matches on the WTA Tour this year, the most since her breakthrough US Open triumph in 2021. The physical demands may be starting to show, with Raducanu's movement falling away as former top-40 player Zhu extended the rallies to keep her on court for longer. Raducanu won only 51% of points on her first serve and 38% on her second. She raced into a 3-0 lead and served out the opening set despite four breaks of serve in the final five games.

It said the FIG's lack of measures was a ""denial of justice"" and created a ""situation of discrimination against a member association"". A Cas statement said the FIG argued it had ""no prerogatives"" in the issuing of entry visas, and the Indonesian government's decision not to grant the visas falls ""outside the competence"" of the organisation. An IGF statement read: ""The rules are clear, and Indonesia's actions constitute a blatant violation of them. ""It is inconceivable that a country can bar another nation from competing in a World Championship while the governing bodies stand by. ""This decision undermines the very foundations of sport and fair competition, and it delivers a severe blow to the morale of the gymnasts and staff who have worked tirelessly for this moment."" Dolgopyat said on Instagram: ""We are so disappointed for the gymnasts, male and female, and professional teams, but not only that, we are deeply concerned by the recent decisions that could negatively impact the future of all our delegations and the future of sport in general. ""We continue the fight, hoping to achieve justice, but unfortunately we will no longer be able to compete in these World Championships."" Dolgopyat was one of six gymnasts - alongside Eyal Indig, Ron Pyatov, Lihie Raz, Yali Shoshani and Roni Shamay - who submitted the requests to Cas in conjunction with the IGF. Dolgopyat, 28, won Olympic floor gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and silver in Paris last year. He is also a two-time European champion. In 2023 Indonesia was stripped of its right to host football's Under-20 World Cup after the governor of Bali, where the draw was due to take place, refused to host the Israel team.

0fc2620d3a32,New leadership keeping England refreshed - Capsey,,"All-rounder Alice Capsey says new captain and coach duo Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards have given England a freshness as they look to stretch their unbeaten run in the World Cup against Pakistan. Sciver-Brunt's side have beaten South Africa, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka so far, and will be favourites against a winless Pakistan in Colombo on Wednesday. Capsey, who is batting at seven and providing a fourth spin option, also emphasised the importance of taking winning momentum into crunch games at the end of the group stage against India, Australia and New Zealand. ""The change in leadership with Nat and Lottie coming in has been really refreshing, in the sense that we're talking about the game in a different way,"" Capsey told BBC Sport. ""Lottie is so experienced, and being able to learn from her not only as a coach but from what she achieved as a player, it's amazing. ""It would be greatly appreciated [to face India still unbeaten]. But every team brings a different challenge, and especially in these conditions a team like Pakistan can definitely pose a threat, perhaps a different one to what we are used to. ""I know they haven't won a game so far but they are definitely not a team we are taking lightly."" Capsey made a vital 20 in the tense, low chase against Bangladesh but fell for a duck against Sri Lanka as she was victim to sharp turn from Inoka Ranaweera. The 21-year-old has significant T20 experience in India from playing for Delhi Capitals but is playing in her first 50-over World Cup, and says the spin-friendly conditions are posing a new challenge for her. ""I've never experienced anything like this,"" said Capsey. ""All the pitches during the WPL were quite flat and there wasn't anything like the turn and bounce we've had so far. It's been a real learning curve but an amazing one to learn from. ""I'm expanding my game and developing as a batter as we go, and just watching how Nat and Heather Knight have gone about it has been hugely important for me, being able to pick their brains when I need to.""

a8fe153f8551,NI turn attention to play-off after Germany defeat,,"Manager Michael O'Neill felt had Northern Ireland beaten Germany at Windsor Park in World Cup qualifying on Monday night that they would have been in a ""strong position to achieve something amazing"". It was not to be with Nick Woltemade's somewhat fortuitous goal the difference between the two sides in Belfast. When the dust settles on a window during which his young side also beat Slovakia 2-0 on Friday, O'Neill will surely feel encouraged that such a possibility remains on the table as he seeks to take the side to the game's biggest stage for the first time in four decades. For the second time in five weeks, Northern Ireland's players left the field against the four-time World Cup winners believing they could and perhaps should have taken something from the game. In Cologne last month, it took until after the 70th minute before the visitors tired and quick-fire goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz secured an unconvincing 3-1 win. Back in Belfast on Monday night, it was Northern Ireland who finished the stronger of the sides, but they could not find an equaliser during a final 25 minutes played largely in Germany's third of the pitch. The result ends any realistic chance of O'Neill's side topping Group A, but the performance, allied with wins in their other two matches to date, means they can have real belief that they can both make and then succeed in the play-offs. A draw in next month's seemingly crunch fixture in Slovakia followed by a win over Luxembourg, provided as O'Neill put it ""Germany take care of business at home when they play Slovakia"" in the final matchday, would be enough for second place. Even should that not come to pass, there remains a likely backdoor into the play-offs as an otherwise unqualified group winner from last year's Nations League, although that would potentially mean a considerably stronger opponent in an away semi-final. ""We've gained some momentum and picked up some good results,"" said defender Paddy McNair, one of two players in O'Neill's current squad who played for Northern Ireland in their last major tournament at Euro 2016. ""If I was the opposition, I would not like to face us in the play-offs.

Martin Hibbert and his wife Gabby met Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone Dobbs in the ITV soap, and his on-screen wife Fiz Stape, portrayed by Jennie McAlpine, to share their insights on ""life after injury"" as a married couple. Coronation Street fans recently watched mechanic Tyrone suffer a spinal cord injury in a hit and run, leaving him unable to walk. ""I'm so impressed that Coronation Street has chosen to tell this important story,"" said Spinal Injuries Association vice-president Mr Hibbert. Mr Hibbert was among those standing closest to the suicide bomber when he detonated his homemade device at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds more. He suffered 22 shrapnel wounds and required life-saving surgery at Salford Royal Hospital. His spine was severed by shrapnel, leaving him with a T10 complete spinal cord injury and paralysed from the waist down. Mr Hibbert said: ""Spinal cord injury can happen to anyone, at any time, and having such a big TV programme shine a light on the realities of living with it will make a huge difference. ""By showing that ordinary people can be affected, it helps to raise awareness, break down barriers and start vital conversations about life after injury. ""It was an honour for Gabby and I to share our experience and see first-hand the care and respect the team are putting into getting this right."" PA Media Martin Hibbert is a prominent advocate for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing ITV said the Coronation Street research team worked with the Spinal Injuries Association in developing Tyrone's storyline, and the charity advised writers on scripts. An ITV spokesperson said: ""In the coming months viewers will see Tyrone's struggle to deal with the mental and physical effects of the injury which will put real strain on his and Fiz's marriage."" Halsall and McAlpine thanked Mr Hibbert and his wife for taking the time to meet them and share their experiences. ""We might be telling this story on screen but at the end of the day we go home to our family and friends and leave behind what the characters are going through,"" said Halsall.

d3c3b2d25b9b,"Asylum seeker laughed after killing woman, jury told",,"Asylum seeker laughed after killing woman, jury told James Bovill at Wolverhampton Crown Court and Phil Mackie Midlands Correspondent Family / British Transport Police Rhiannon Whyte's blood was found on Deng Majek's clothes, the court heard An asylum seeker from Sudan danced and laughed after murdering a Walsall hotel worker in a ""vicious and frenzied attack"" on a train station platform, a trial has heard. Prosecutors allege Deng Majek, who claims to be 19, stabbed 27-year-old Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver at Bescot Stadium railway station on 20 October 2024. She died in hospital three days later. Opening the case for the prosecution at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Michelle Heeley KC told the jury that the defendant was ""clearly excited about what he had done"". Mr Majek denies murder. Ms Heeley told the court Ms Wyte's blood was found on the defendant's clothes, while her DNA was discovered under his fingernails. She said Mr Majek was seen on CCTV at the Park Inn Hotel in Walsall, laughing shortly after killing her. The defendant had been living at the hotel, which houses asylum seekers, while Ms Whyte had worked there for about three months. The court heard her job included cleaning and serving food and co-workers could not recall any issue which might have led to the attack. ""There had been an issue about some broken biscuits with some of the residents but nothing serious,"" Ms Heeley said. In a statement released following her death, Rhiannon Whyte's family described her as ""selfless... brave, quirky, funny"" and always there for other people. The prosecution said CCTV showed the defendant staring at Ms Whyte, before he followed her from the hotel to the railway station when she finished her shift at 23:00 BST. ""He had been hanging around waiting for her to leave and waited until she was on her own before he followed her,"" Ms Heeley said. The court was told Ms Whyte called a friend at 23:04 and he was seen on CCTV cameras closing the gap on her as she approached the deserted platform. Ms Heeley said: ""It was then that the prosecution say that this defendant attacked her."" Her friend heard a scream and then another scream, before the phone went dead at 23:19. The prosecution said Mr Majek could then be seen running back up the stairs with an object in his hand, which they said was Ms Whyte's mobile phone. Ms Heeley said he then went to a local shop to buy himself a drink before returning to the hotel. Slumped on platform She added: ""In between the station and the hotel he had thrown Rhiannon's phone into a river. ""Once at the hotel he was seen dancing and laughing, clearly excited about what he had done."" The train she had been due to catch pulled in at 23:24 and the driver saw a figure slumped on the platform, the court was told. Ms Heeley said the guard tried to help her, along with another employee from the hotel, but nothing could be done to save her and she died on 23 October, having never regained consciousness. The court was told 11 of the 23 stab wounds penetrated her skull, one of which damaged the brain stem, causing her death. She also had injuries to her chest and arm, indicating she had tried to defend herself, the court heard. The puncture wounds had the appearance of a cross-headed screwdriver, which has never been found. Ms Heeley said: ""He left her bleeding to death and then casually went back to his hotel. We say you can be sure he is guilty of murder."" The trial is expected to last about three weeks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy902djzv2o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/88b8/live/a00ccce0-a8f6-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-14T13:40:33.287000+00:00,6dee0bac99254c523a35af131b08c1c6fc4c2d76
f32c9d710110,"Recognising Palestinian state helped get ceasefire, PM says",,"Recognising Palestinian state helped get ceasefire, PM says Brian Wheeler Political reporter House of Commons The UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood helped to bring about the ceasefire deal in Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs. Speaking after a summit in Egypt, the PM stressed that the agreement signed there belonged to US President Donald Trump, telling MPs: ""This is his deal."" But he said the UK had been in a position to work ""behind the scenes"" for a ceasefire ""precisely because of the approach this government takes,"" including its recognition of a Palestinian state. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said recognising Palestine without setting a condition for the release of hostages was ""rewarding terrorism"" and accused the PM of ""diminishing"" UK influence in the Middle East. Sir Keir told MPs that Monday's deal provided ""a moment of profound relief"" as he paid tribute to both the hostages and the civilians killed in Gaza. But he also stressed that ""making that peace last will be no less difficult a task"" and that implementing the peace plan ""is no small challenge"". Negotiations will now follow on phase two of the deal, which involves Hamas laying down its weapons - a possibility the group is reported to have dismissed - and the rebuilding of Gaza under a ""peace board"" chaired by Trump and potentially including former prime minister Sir Tony Blair. Sir Keir said the UK stood ready to deploy its diplomacy and expertise to support the reconstruction of Gaza - the devastation of which he says ""defies description"". The UK will provide an additional £20m in humanitarian aid to provide ""water, sanitation and hygiene products"" to people in the territory, he added. There are no plans to send British troops to be part of the multinational force that will monitor the truce, but the prime minister said the UK would help with the ceasefire monitoring process. And he said the UK could draw on its experience in Northern Ireland to ""play a full role"" in the decommissioning of Hamas's weapons and capability. The prime minster told MPs the deal represented the ""first real chance we've had"" of a two-state solution since the 1993 Oslo Accords , which were meant to provide interim self-government for Palestine as a stepping stone to an independent state. ""So we are fully committed to this [deal] because a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state, is the only way to secure lasting peace for the Middle East,"" he told MPs. The PM also claimed that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had aided the cause of peace. He told MPs: ""This move, taken alongside our allies France, Canada, Australia and others, helped lead to the historic New York declaration, where for the first time the entire Arab League condemned the atrocities of October 7, urged Hamas to disarm and, crucially, demanded that they end their rule in Gaza."" Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of ""taking the wrong decisions time and time again, diminishing our influence in"" the Middle East. ""It's quite clear that UK relations with Israel have been strained by the actions of this government,"" she told MPs, to cries of ""shame"" from the Labour benches. The Conservative leader added: ""In a move praised by Hamas, Labour decided to recognise a state of Palestine with no condition to release the hostages still held in the tunnels of Gaza, rewarding terrorism."" At the time, the US voiced strong opposition to the UK and other countries recognising Palestinian statehood, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Hamas would ""feel more emboldened"" by the move. Under Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan , Gaza would initially be governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a ""Board of Peace"". Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms. According to the plan, Hamas - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly. The ceasefire deal says Hamas should release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza after two years of war. All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex18xx9xeo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a419/live/650a2030-a922-11f0-a87a-599d240e4891.jpg,2025-10-14T15:07:41.027000+00:00,08150b385efd44969480d5769c0e69c6c5aba2b5
988f35a012f9,European rights body urges UK ministers to review protest laws,,"Europe's human rights watchdog has raised concerns about the policing of protests in the UK following arrests over the ban on Palestine Action, and called for broader protest laws to be reviewed. In a letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O'Flaherty said law changes had allowed authorities to ""impose excessive limits on freedom of assembly"". Responding in a statement, Mahmood said the right to protest was ""a fundamental freedom"" but had to be balanced with the right of people to live ""without fear"". O'Flaherty also wrote to two chairs of parliamentary committees expressing ""concern about the current climate for trans people in the UK"". As commissioner, Mr O'Flaherty is tasked with identifying potential shortcomings in human rights law in countries that are signed up to the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, including the UK. The Conservative Party recently announced it would leave the convention if it wins the next general election, while the Labour government has said it is reviewing how it is applied in UK law in relation to asylum cases. It is understood the home secretary plans to respond to Mr O'Flaherty's letter, which was sent last month and published by the commissioner on Tuesday . A government source said Mahmood took a ""dim view of the arguments"" and ""fundamentally disagrees with the assessment"". ""It doesn't help sustain public confidence in the European Convention when the council is seen to intervene in domestic politics and national security in this way."" Allies of Mahmood also said that she considers the Supreme Court's judgement on the issue of trans rights to be ""beyond reproach"". In his letter to Mahmood, sent following a five-day visit to the UK over the summer,  O'Flaherty said two laws passed under the previous government - the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 - raised questions under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Public Order Act was in part passed to counter environmental groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which deployed tactics aimed at causing disruption such as gluing themselves to roads. Mr O'Flaherty said the laws ""allow authorities to impose excessive limits on freedom of assembly and expression, and risk over-policing"". He recommended that ""a comprehensive review of the compliance of the current legislation on the policing of protests with the United Kingdom's human rights obligations be undertaken"". He also expressed concern about measures in Labour's Crime and Policing Bill - which is currently being debated in Parliament - that would ban protesters from wearing face coverings in particular locations. He said such a ban should not be enforced unless there was ""evidence of imminent violence"". The bill would also put restrictions on gatherings ""in the vicinity of a place of worship"" - a move the government has said is in response to a series of ""intimidating protests"" near synagogues and mosques. O'Flaherty argued that the term ""vicinity"" was ""undefined"" and could make it ""impossible in practice to organise protests in large cities or towns"" and urged ministers to reconsider the measure. The government has recently announced other changes including allowing police officers to instruct protest organisers to hold events in a different place, if a site has been the location of repeated demonstrations. It has also said it could consider further restrictions , including targeting some chants used at pro-Palestinian protests. Defend Our Juries, a group campaigning against the government's decision to ban Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation, has accused ministers of pursuing an ""anti-democratic agenda"". Hundreds of people have been arrested at protests against the ban, where some people have held up placards reading: ""I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action."" Noting the large number of arrests, O'Flaherty said domestic laws ""designed to counter 'terrorism' or 'violent extremism' must not impose any limitations on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, that are not strictly necessary for the protection of national security and the rights and freedoms of others"". In a statement, Mahmood defended the government's approach saying: ""Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes. ""This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community, which has been expressed to me on many occasions in these recent difficult days."" Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""This is the latest example of foreign bureaucrats lecturing Britain on how to police its own streets... this is precisely why the Conservative Party have committed to leaving the ECHR."" Separately, O'Flaherty has written to the Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee Sarah Owen and Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights Lord Alton to warn against creating legal uncertainty for transgender people as the UK government implements a Supreme Court judgement made earlier this year. In April, the court unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Following the judgement, Britain's equalities watchdog issued new guidance which says that in places such as hospitals, shops and restaurants ""trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities"". The guidance has been submitted to Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson and is awaiting UK government approval. O'Flaherty said the European Convention of Human Rights ""guarantees the right of trans people to personal development and to physical and moral security"". He argued that in the process of implementing new guidance, the government should ""avoid a situation where a person's legal gender recognition is voided of practical meaning, to the extent that it leaves trans people in an unacceptable 'intermediate zone'"". He said the new guidance should be clear on ""how inclusion of trans people can be achieved across all areas, and how exclusion can be minimised to situations in which this would be strictly necessary and proportionate"". Asked about the letter, Downing Street said: ""We are clear that there are laws in place to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment, and we proudly uphold a robust legislative framework. ""But we have never supported self-ID and we have a process in place when it comes to someone changing their legal sex.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pl4pzg87o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/88d3/live/7c2f1e10-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg,2025-10-14T17:31:34.828000+00:00,f881ce8b560f36ced26e1ed54d16117dfa6441e9
aa2f6e811702,Peer faces Lords ban for raising speeding fines with police chief,,"Former House of Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza faces an eight-week suspension after complaining to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner about ""unfair"" speeding fines. A Lords inquiry found the 81-year-old peer broke rules on ""personal honour"" by writing to Sir Mark Rowley on Lords headed notepaper to query multiple breaches of the 20mph limit adding up to £400 in fines. Baroness D'Souza said she only wanted to ""open a conversation"" on London speed limits, but later called the letter to Sir Mark ""unwise"" and said she regretted sending it. The Lords Standards Commissioner ruled the letter was ""an attempt to influence"" the police investigation. In his report , Commissioner for Standards Martin Jelley said Baroness D'Souza's actions ""may harm the House by eroding public trust in parliamentarians and in institutions which exist to serve the public interest"". In the letter, Baroness D'Souza complained the offences would result in 12 points on her driving licence, which meant she would lose it and might have to ""give up attending Parliament"". ""I live deep in the countryside with no local bus services and unsuitable train schedules,"" she added. The peer had asked Sir Mark if losing her licence was ""a fair response for exceeding the speed limit while we are all still learning what a 20-mile speed actually feels like?"" ""Who can say if my speedometer or your radar is entirely accurate in recording 21 miles instead of 20,"" she added in her letter, which was sent on House of Lords headed paper. Baroness D'Souza,  a crossbench peer who does not belong to a party, was eventually disqualified from driving temporarily on 16 July. She has only spoken in the House of Lords once since then and, voted twice. In the letter, she acknowledged that Sir Mark, the UK's most senior police officer who also leads on Britain's counter-terrorism efforts, had ""much other business to deal with"". ""I apologise for bothering your office with such a trivial matter,"" she added. The Met Police passed the letter to the House of Lords' commissioner for standards who recommended an eight-week suspension, citing the aggravating factor that the intervention was for personal benefit. Baroness D'Souza,  who was the Lords' speaker between 2011 and 2016, denied she had been attempting to influence the police investigation, but instead find ""any mitigating factors"" that might keep any driving ban to a minimum. She told investigators she used Lords stationery because she had previously met Sir Mark ""in the context"" of her parliamentary role. Baroness D'Souza accepted that her letter to the Met Police chief was ""inappropriate"" and said she ""deeply regretted"" the decision to send it. She appealed against the proposed eight-week Lords ban, claiming it was ""unduly severe"" compared with shorter suspensions for bullying or misuse of facilities. Her appeal was rejected by the committee. The report will now go before the House for approval. If agreed, the suspension will take effect immediately. Baroness D'Souza was previously criticised for billing taxpayers thousands of pounds in expenses for chauffeur-driven cars. This includes a keeping chauffeur-driven Mercedes waiting outside the Royal Opera House - just a mile from parliament - for four hours, before returning to the Lords at a cost of £230.40. She also used a Mercedes to get from Westminster to Canterbury for the enthronement of Archbishop Justin Welby in March 2013 cost £627, freedom of information results found.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4558r5gko,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fe10/live/beb55400-a914-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg,2025-10-14T16:20:31.632000+00:00,c6f743436f736c6290ef14f4926c78bb77258448
e028c69e8cbb,Miliband defends clean power goal after energy bills rise,,"Miliband defends clean power goal after energy bills rise Joshua Nevett Political reporter PA Media Ed Miliband has said the government's drive to deliver clean power is ""the best way"" to bring down energy costs, amid calls from opposition parties to scrap green levies. The energy secretary told an industry conference the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles' heel"" and argued clean power was the only way to reduce bills. The UK government is aiming for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030, and Miliband has pledged to lower average bills by £300 by that date. But bills went up by 2% for millions of people in England, Wales and Scotland under energy regulator Ofgem's latest price cap this month. The cost of household energy bills has become a prominent political battleground, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming net-zero policies for higher prices. The UK government is under a legal obligation to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, after a law change passed in 2019 with cross-party support. However, political consensus on the goal has since broken down, with the Conservatives announcing last week they would axe the legally binding target, end subsidies for renewables and ditch taxes on carbon emissions. Reform UK, which gained its first MPs at last year's general election, has pledged to scrap net zero and ""wage war"" on renewables developers if it wins power. There was a rapid spike in energy prices in 2021, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and although costs have gone down, they have remained high by historical standards. Energy experts say higher costs have primarily been driven by the UK's reliance on gas and its exposure to its volatile prices on international markets. But there are costs to renewables too, including green levies to fund the rollout of renewables and upgrades to the electricity grid. Ofgem said higher bills this winter were the result of extra funding for means-tested discounts off energy bills, and system costs, including switching generators such as windfarms on and off. The Conservatives and Reform UK have honed in on the cost of energy in the UK as their main justification for scrapping net zero, and argue Miliband's pledge of lowering bills by £300 won't be realised. But in his speech to a conference organised by Energy UK, an industry group, Miliband insisted renewable power was cheaper than gas. ""Dependency on global fossil fuel markets is this country's energy Achilles heel,"" Miliband told delegates. ""Some people want to double down on this weakness - this government disagrees. ""We believe that the sprint for clean power is the best way to reliably bring down bills for good and give us energy abundance."" On Monday, the UK government announced the approval of a large solar farm in Lincolnshire and said it had approved enough clean energy projects to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes. Heated debate But at the Energy UK conference, industry bosses urged the UK government to take urgent action to reduce the costs of electricity for households and businesses. Dhara Vyas, Energy UK's CEO, said electricity costs had been high for too long and ""customers cannot be expected to shrug off persistently high bills because of benefits some years away"". ""The widespread concern about bills is of course closely linked with public perception and the discussion about how we fairly pay for the cost of the transition,"" Ms Vyvas said. She said taking action to reduce energy bills should be top of the government's to-do list ahead of the upcoming autumn Budget. Ministers are considering removing policy costs from energy bills to make electricity cheaper. Policy costs are effectively government taxes used to fund environmental and social schemes, such as subsidies for renewables. These costs made up about 16% of an electricity bill and 6% of a gas bill last year, according to research by the charity Nesta. The Climate Change Committee has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition. One option - backed by Energy UK - is shifting policy costs from electricity bills to gas. 'Take on myths' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Conservative shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho also gave speeches at the Energy UK conference in London. The Liberal Democrats have set out a plan to increase investment in clean energy and change how new renewable projects are paid for. They say their plan could halve energy bills by 2035. In his speech, Sir Ed contrasted his party's proposals with those of Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, claiming he was inspired by US President Donald Trump and would ""put up bills, destroy jobs and hurt the economy, while climate change rages on"". ""So now the cross-party consensus on investing in renewables has been shattered,"" Sir Ed said. ""And it would be incredibly complacent and dangerous to assume it will just put itself back together on its own."" Sir Ed said supporters of renewable energy ""either take on the myths or we fail families for at least a decade"". In her speech, Coutinho said the UK had among the highest electricity costs in the world. She said given carbon emissions were still rising globally, ""many would agree our approach to climate change isn't working in the way it's supposed to"". Coutinho, a former energy secretary, said the UK government needed to be more ""clear-eyed and honest with the public"" about the cost of renewables, once subsidies, grid investments and other factors had been taken into account. ""So if the argument is renewables are cheap, let's look at the full costs and examine that and present those facts to the public,"" Coutinho said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzn1vx701o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/280a/live/19851000-a91a-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg,2025-10-14T16:47:50.963000+00:00,a4d26952fd91dae52fe0eafeff2407b9198eca62
ae74e0f53a3f,"UK will be second-fastest-growing G7 economy, IMF predicts",,"UK will be second-fastest-growing G7 economy, IMF predicts Faisal Islam BBC Economics Editor and Lucy Hooker Business reporter Getty Images Chancellor Rachel Reeves said, despite the IMF's upgrade to UK economic growth, ""for too many people, our economy feels stuck"" The UK is set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year, according to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills. The forecasts are part of the Fund's twice-a-year outlook for the global economy. It said so far there had been a ""muted response"" to the wave of tariffs imposed on imports to the US this year, but that they were having an impact on global growth. The IMF, whose purpose is to bring its 190 members together, to work on maintaining global economic stability, is a respected forecaster. However, uncertainties, ranging from geopolitics to the weather, often derail expectations. According to the Fund's latest predictions, unveiled as government officials gather in Washington DC, the UK appears to be weathering the storm better than others. The IMF predicts that in 2025 the UK economy will outperform other G7 economies, apart from the US, in what has been a torrid year for trade and geopolitical tensions. The G7 are a grouping of the world's richer countries, including the US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Japan, but not fast-growing economies such as India and China. Despite edging ahead of most rivals, UK economic growth rates are expected to remain modest at 1.3% for this year and next. Moreover, on a per head basis economic output is only set to grow 0.4% this year and 0.5% in 2026, putting the UK at the bottom of the G7 league table. The chancellor Rachel Reeves who arrived in Washington on Tuesday, said people sensed the economy was ""stuck"". ""Working people feel it every day, experts talk about it, and I am going to deal with it,"" she said. The chancellor will use the IMF gathering to try to provide reassurance over the UK's financial stability and tout the country as an attractive place for investment. Price pressures However the IMF warned the UK still faces stronger inflation than in other similar countries, with prices forecast to rise by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026. The IMF said higher inflation was likely to be temporary, and should fall to 2% by the end of next year. Speaking at a separate event in Washington, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he also believed inflationary pressures were easing, after unemployment data in the UK on Tuesday showed unemployment rising and wage growth slowing. Highlighting the inflation forecasts, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the IMF assessment made for ""grim reading"". He said UK households were ""being squeezed from all sides"", adding: ""Since taking office, Labour have allowed the cost of living to rise, debt to balloon and business confidence to collapse to record lows."" Trump tariffs loom large The IMF's global outlook was dominated by the reaction to US tariffs, a weakened dollar, questions about the independence of the US Federal Reserve and sky-high valuations of US tech companies, the Fund said. The IMF said resilience was ""giving way to warning signs"" and that US tariffs costs, were starting to feed through to higher prices for American shoppers. However, in an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the worst consequences of a global trade war had been tempered. ""The effect of the tariff shock is there. It is negative for global outlook. It is weighing down on investment and consumption decisions, there is trade policy uncertainty… but it's not as bad as expected because the shock itself has been scaled down and there are these offsets,"" he said. The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment and he said the Bank of England should be ""very cautious"" about cutting interest rates as expectations around future inflation remained high. The IMF's forecast noted that Canada's economy, hit hard by the trade-war with the US will be pushed into second place in the growth league table this year. However, Canada is expected to retake second place next year when its economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%. Germany, France and Italy are all forecast to grow far more slowly at rates of between 0.2 and 0.9% in 2025 and 2026. Economist tells the BBC's Michelle Fleury he sees ""lower growth"" and ""higher inflation"" for US AI warning The IMF also pointed to ""excessively optimistic"" expectations around AI, which could trigger a market correction. In its separate Global Financial Stability Report the IMF concluded that markets appeared ""complacent"". Mr Gourinchas said the IMF was not asserting that there would be an imminent bursting of a bubble, but that this was ""one of the risks"" it was looking at. The concentration of the overvaluation of tech stocks on a small number of companies was now ""substantially higher"" than at the dotcom bubble in 2020, the IMF said. However, Mr Gourinchas said the ""AI investment boom"" was also helping sustain US economic growth.

The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses. The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: ""If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part."" ""This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,"" Mahmood said. ""But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life."" Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process. Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE. To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the ""going rate"" for their type of work, whichever is highest. The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years. According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can ""understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics."" They can express themselves ""fluently and spontaneously"" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce ""clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint"". Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday. The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system ""controlled, selective and fair"". Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year. Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a ""trade-off"" between ""ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits."" Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said. The new language requirements will have ""more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency"". Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was ""unfair"" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English ""because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level"". ""This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,"" she said. ""The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably."" Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027. Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months. The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations. This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively. As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8679q0pe57o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0fde/live/5730d520-a919-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T18:10:29.122000+00:00,32e21e2a00d223961a4f69522b2b61be0c85a47c

Hundreds took part in the 5 km (3.1 mile) race in Victoria Park on Sunday, according to East London Mosque (ELM), which organised the event. It was advertised as ""inclusive"", but it was only open to men, boys, and girls under 12. MP Steve Reed said blocking women was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) would investigate. The ELM has not directly addressed the criticism but said it had a ""long-standing commitment to supporting women and girls"" and encourages women to take part in various sporting activities. The annual event is described on the mosque's website as having become a ""highlight in the East London Muslim calendar"", raising thousands of pounds for causes across the UK and abroad, including local youth projects, food banks and refugee support. When asked about women being barred from the race on LBC Radio, Reed said: ""I saw these reports... and I was as horrified as anybody else. ""It's absolutely unacceptable that women should be blocked from going on a fun run in a public space when the men are allowed to go out there and do that. 'We cannot tolerate that' He said he was sure the equalities watchdog would be aware of the case and appropriate sanctions would follow. He added: ""Speaking for myself, I was appalled. ""We do not want a situation in this country where men are allowed to do things that women are then barred from. We cannot tolerate that."" The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, is quoted on the website congratulating all those who took part , ""especially to the youngsters and the elders and the community at large for participating today"". The council said it had contacted the mosque to ""seek urgent clarification"" after reports about age and gender restrictions. Reuters Steve Reed said it was ""absolutely unacceptable"" for women to be barred from the event An EHRC spokesperson said each complaint was considered carefully and that there are certain exceptions under equality law that can apply to charities and belief organisations, including potentially restricting events to one sex only. A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: ""This was an independent event held in Victoria Park, not organised by the council. ""Like many local charitable events, it made use of the park space. We are firmly committed to ensuring leisure and sporting activities in Tower Hamlets are inclusive and accessible."" Last weekend's event was the mosque's 12th annual charity run. A spokesperson for the mosque said: ""ELM encourages women to take part in sporting activities. There are many Muslim women from our community who have taken part in sporting events including boat races, cycling, hiking and marathons as well as various sporting challenges to raise funds for charity.

ce52c3819bdf,"Boris Johnson 'chose NHS over children', ex-minister tells Covid inquiry",,"Boris Johnson 'chose NHS over children', ex-minister tells Covid inquiry Vanessa Clarke Education reporter Getty Images Gavin Williamson's evidence to the Covid inquiry highlighted a number of disagreements with then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson accused ministers of ""not putting children first"" when making the ""unnecessary"" decision to close schools in January 2021, the Covid inquiry has heard. He said one argument made in favour of closing schools at the time was that it was ""like smashing a Ming vase on the floor to get people's attention"", which he said pointed to a ""lack of seriousness"" in government. He said then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""chose the NHS over children"" at the time, adding that he believed ""the consequences for children weren't properly taken into account"". This part of the inquiry is looking at how the pandemic impacted children and young people. Williamson told the inquiry on Tuesday he had thought he had ""won the argument"" around children going back to school in January 2021, ""but events overtook"". The inquiry was shown an expletive-laden text Williamson sent to the then-prime minister that February, in which he said he had taken ""abuse"" for the government's decision to shut schools one day after they reopened. It was one of several disagreements with the prime minister which were highlighted in Tuesday's evidence. He also accused Johnson of giving parents ""a false sense of hope"" when he announced a phased return to school in May 2020. He said this promise was ""destined to fail"" because of social distancing rules at the time. ""There was no physical way we could do it [reopen schools] without asking every school to basically break the law,"" Williamson said. Getty Images Schools were closed on 5 January 2021, one day after they reopened Elsewhere, the former education secretary said he regretted the lack of planning that went into school closures at the start of the pandemic. ""I readily accept that there were many mistakes that were made,"" he said. He apologised to the inquiry for failing to pay more attention to scientific evidence published in February, which suggested school closures could delay or reduce the peak of the pandemic. The government should have ""bitten the bullet"" and made a plan for school closures, he said, adding that he had made an error by ""sticking with the plan"" to keep schools open, as that was the focus of the government in March 2020. It was only overnight on 17 March 2020 that a plan was put together to close schools, before an announcement was made the next day. ""I regret that and wish we had very much done it differently,"" Williamson told the inquiry. ""But we were at the time acting in what we believed was the best interest and under the best guidance."" He also said it probably would not have been ""allowed"" to start preparing for the closure of schools without approval from Downing Street. ""Something like Covid is being directed from the centre, in terms of different departments' responses,"" he said. ""You don't have quite the freedom just to go and start going out and consulting with lots of people."" Over the last two weeks, the inquiry has heard from various head teachers who said they started making their own plans for school closures weeks before any announcement was made. Lyndon Lewis, a head teacher in Wales, said he and three of his staff met an IT expert at a service station on the M4 to find out how to use Google Classrooms. Sir Jon Coles, from United Learning, who has previously worked at the Department for Education, told the inquiry he started planning for school closures a week before the announcement for the more than 50,000 children in his trust. He said he ""fell off his chair"" when he heard Williamson's submitted written evidence which said the government had no plan in place. On Tuesday, Williamson rejected Sir Jon's accusation that the lack of planning represented a ""dereliction of duty"", but conceded that ""the depth of the challenge we were facing hadn't been properly grasped"". ""I readily accept I am secretary of state and it was my responsibility,"" Williamson said on Tuesday. Getty Images Gavin Williamson was the education secretary in 2020 and 2021 when exams were cancelled due to the pandemic Tuesday's evidence also touched on the exams debacle of August 2020, in which the government had to U-turn on its model for awarding grades after exams were cancelled earlier that summer. Williamson admitted he knew ahead of time that ""there were some students who wouldn't get the grades they would deserve"". That was ""not the right approach"", Williamson told the inquiry. Students were ultimately awarded teacher-assessed grades, which led to a boom in top marks. But Williamson said Ofqual, the exams regulator, was responsible for some of the fiasco, saying that if he had pushed them to use teacher-assessed grades in the first place, they would have ""resigned"". Representatives for Ofqual have not yet appeared at the inquiry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30v3938qz7o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f4eb/live/3b9e1bb0-a90a-11f0-99b2-a3801a157d90.jpg,2025-10-14T16:04:29.313000+00:00,e41c1629569ef9036f81e1a517ad2498b8e8b0b1
a78b4a879511,"Bowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peace",,"Bowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peace Jeremy Bowen International editor EPA/Shutterstock Speaking to the Israeli parliament, Trump declared ""the historic dawn of a new Middle East"" Donald Trump's quick trip to Israel and Egypt was the victory lap he wanted. Anyone watching the speeches he made in Jerusalem and Sharm el-Sheikh, could see a man luxuriating in his power - enjoying the applause in Israel's parliament, and in Egypt, basking in the fact that so many heads of state and government had flown in. One veteran diplomat in the room said it looked as if Trump saw the role of the world leaders there as extras on his film set. Trump's message at Sharm was, in effect, that he had created a historical turning point. ""All I've done all my life is deals. The greatest deals just sort of happen… That's what happened right here. And maybe this is going to be the greatest deal of them all,"" he said. Observers might also have had the impression from the speeches that the job is done. It is not. Without question, Trump can claim credit for the ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. Qatar, Turkey and Egypt used their leverage with Hamas to force it to accept. That made it a joint effort, but Trump's role was decisive. Without his push to demand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's agreement to terms that he had previously rejected, the deal would not have been signed. It helps to recognise what the deal is – and what it isn't. The agreement was for a ceasefire and an exchange of hostages for prisoners. It is not a peace agreement, or even the start of a peace process. The next phase of the Trump 20-point plan requires an agreement filling in the gaps of the framework which declares that the Gaza Strip will be demilitarised, secured and governed by a committee including Palestinians. It will report to a Board of Peace chaired by President Trump. Significant work needs to be done on the detail needed to make that happen. The Gaza agreement is not a route map to peace in the Middle East, the ultimate and so far, unreachable destination. Reuters Netanyahu called Trump the ""greatest friend"" Israel had ever had in the White House Just as seriously, there is no evidence of the political will necessary to make a real peace deal. Most wars end with exhausted belligerents making some kind of agreement. The war in Gaza has become one of those, if as Trump has declared, it really is over. The other way to end a war is with a total victory that lets the winners dictate the way ahead. The best example is the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945. Before 9 September, when Netanyahu ordered a missile strike on Qatar he seemed to still be intent on crushing Israel's enemy so comprehensively, that Israel would be able to dictate the future of Gaza. The strike infuriated Trump. Qatar is one of America's key allies in the region, and the site of the biggest US military base in the Middle East. It is also a place where his sons have been doing lucrative business. Trump dismissed Netanyahu's justification that the target, which was missed, was the Hamas leadership, not Qatar. For Trump, America's interests come before Israel's. He is not like Joe Biden, who was prepared to accept harm to America's position in the region as the necessary price for supporting Israel. CCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Doha Trump is back in Washington DC. Diplomats say the Americans realise that getting the detail sorted out is vital and will not happen quickly. The problem is that they might not have enough time. Ceasefires always get violated in their early stages. The ones that survive tend to be based on a tight agreements, made by warring parties who have decided that their best option is to make them work. The danger is that the Gaza ceasefire lacks those underpinnings. Only 24 hours after Israelis and Palestinians, for very different reasons, shared joy and relief that hostages, prisoners and detainees were home, cracks are appearing in the ceasefire. Hamas has, so far, returned only four of the bodies of the 28 hostages who were killed during their incarceration. Its explanation is that it is very hard to find their graves in the sea of rubble that Israel has created in Gaza. Israel's patience is thin. The fate of the bodies of the hostages will become a bigger and bigger issue in Israel if their remains are not repatriated. As a first response, Israel has said that until Hamas fulfils its obligations it will cut the flow of aid into Gaza in half, and will not reopen Gaza's border crossing with Egypt - the Rafah crossing. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's extremist ultranationalist finance minister who opposes the Gaza deal, posted on social media that ""only military pressure brings back hostages"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) still occupies 55% of the Gaza Strip. This morning its soldiers killed Palestinians who they said were approaching their forces. Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza told the BBC that seven people were killed in two incidents. It could be that the IDF is still observing the rules of engagement that it was using before the ceasefire. They order troops to watch two imaginary lines around their positions. If one is crossed, they fire warning shots. If Palestinians continue to approach their positions and cross a second imaginary line, IDF troops can shoot to kill. A big problem with the system is that Palestinians do not know where the lines are. It is crowd control with live fire. As for Hamas, it is reasserting its power. Its men, armed and masked are back on the streets. It has attacked rival armed clans, some of which have been protected by the IDF. Videos have circulated of Hamas killing blindfolded and kneeling men who they have accused of collaborating with the Israelis. The grisly videos of extra-judicial executions in the street send a message to any Palestinians who want to defy them that they should not dare - and to the outside world that Hamas has survived Israel's onslaught. Reuters Gaza City has been reduced to grey rubble Point 15 of the Trump plan for Gaza says the US ""will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza"". Raising and deploying that force will be impossible if the ceasefire is not solid. Potential contributors will not send in their troops to use force to disarm Hamas. Hamas has hinted it might give up some heavy weapons but will not be disarmed. It has an ideology of Islamic resistance to Israel, and knows that without weapons its Palestinian enemies will come for revenge. Netanyahu has threatened that if no-one else will do it, Israel will finish the job. Hamas's weapons have to go, he has said, the ""easy way or the hard way"". Trump has proclaimed that his Gaza deal, as it stands, will end generations of conflict between Arabs and Jews over the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He insists too that it will lead to a broader peace across the Middle East. If he really believes that the job of making peace is done, then he is deluding himself. Just trying needs sustained focus, hard diplomatic work and a decision by the two sides in the fight that the time has come to make painful sacrifices and compromises. To make peace, other dreams have to be jettisoned. Past American presidents have also believed that they can make peace in the Middle East. Trump will discover that peace is not made just because a president, however powerful, decides that it is going to happen.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86118q6ego,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e2de/live/f8ca8c40-a910-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T17:31:59.188000+00:00,c6a526015882f4b71744a6d3766e35defa8a8711

""I may not have survived if both grenades had exploded. Bipin showed courage and threw the grenade out,"" Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary told BBC Nepali. He was speaking after the Israeli military identified his friend's body as being among four dead hostages returned by Hamas under the Gaza ceasefire accord. Bipin was 23 and working on a kibbutz when he was taken by Hamas into captivity along with 250 others on 7 October 2023. It's unclear how or when he died. His family and friends hoped right up to the release deadline that he might be among living hostages returned on 13 October, but he wasn't, and a day later their worst fears were confirmed. Bipin, Dhan Bahadur and 15 other Nepalese agriculture students had been in Israel for just over three weeks when Kibbutz Alumim was attacked. ""We knew that there may be a war in Israel. But we had no idea that there may be any ground attack of that magnitude,"" Dhan Bahadur said. ""We thought that there could be missile attacks and we would be safe if we stay underground, in the bunkers."" For the students who'd been invited under the Israeli government's ""Earn and Learn Programme"" it was a great opportunity to make better lives for themselves and their families in Nepal. Dhan Bahadur credits his survival to Bipin's courage. ""At the time of attack, two grenades were thrown near the bunkers. He [Bipin] picked up one and threw it outside; one exploded inside. Due to that explosion, I and four others were injured,"" he says. ""He was unharmed at that point. If both grenades had exploded, I would not have been speaking with you like this."" Ten of the Nepalese students were killed in the attack. Bipin was the only one captured. ""We met for the last time when he and others were being shifted to another bunker,"" Dhan Bahadur says. ""Because, after the injury, I could not move and I stayed in the first bunker. I later came to know that there were two attacks in the bunker where he took shelter and he was held captive from there."" Courtesy Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary Many of the students can be seen in this selfie inside the bunker 30 minutes before the attack, taken by one of those killed The 27-year-old says he feels deeply saddened after hearing about his colleague's death. He and Bipin studied together in Far Western University School of Agriculture in Tikapur, Nepal. ""We made all possible efforts from our sides to secure his release. We did everything. But yesterday, we had to face such shocking news. All of Nepal is in grief. I do not know what to say. I have no words to explain my sorrow."" Dhan Bahadur says Bipin and other colleagues had the same goal of making little savings and starting their own enterprise after returning from the exchange programme in Israel. ""He loved playing football and basketball. We would chat for hours about our goals and dreams. He wanted to get his body in good shape and to buy a new mobile phone. We even recorded a song about friendship with my phone. He also talked about showcasing himself in a music video."" Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary Bipin and Dhan Bahadur with Israeli friends, in a final selfie at the Kibbutz Alumim basketball court On 14 October, the Israeli military said it believed Bipin Joshi was ""murdered in captivity during the first months of the war"". There's no way of independently confirming that. But if it's the case, Dhan Bahadur said, the international community should ask Hamas about why it happened. He said he had not received any support from Nepal's government following his injury but hoped the Israeli government would help Bipin's family. Bipin's immediate family members have not released any statement so far. Footage from 7 October showed him walking inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. His family received no signs of life for a year, until the Israeli military shared a video of him in captivity around November 2023. Relatives described the footage as ""proof of life"" just hours before the ceasefire deal was agreed, and were hoping for a miracle. Now in his hometown of Bhimdutta municipality Bipin's family are grieving after hearing news of his death. Hostages and Missing Families Forum The bodies of Bipin Joshi and fellow hostage Guy Illouz were handed over by Hamas in Gaza on Monday His mother and sister had gone to the United States to lobby for the release of hostages, Bipin's cousin Kishore Joshi told BBC Nepali. He says the family has no words to describe the grief. ""His mother and sister are returning from US on Thursday. The father is not in the condition to express the pain in words."" Meanwhile it's unclear when Bipin's body will be returned to his family. Israel is making all necessary arrangements to repatriate his remains to Nepal, as it did for the other students who died, Nepal's ministry of foreign affairs said. ""We are all shocked by the news of Bipin Joshi's death. In this time of sorrow [we] extend our deep sympathy to the grieving family,"" it said in a statement of condolence. ""Even after Bipin Joshi's body is brought back to Nepal, we will continue appropriate efforts in co-ordination and co-operation with the concerned government authorities and stakeholders - to uncover the truth about the actual cause and circumstances of his death."" Dhan Bahadur says he and other colleagues who returned safely from Israel plan to visit Bipin's family in Kanchanpur district. ""We will keep his memories alive. We will provide our care, support and consolation to his family."" He still feels numb. ""I returned to Nepal and I am studying at the moment.

99231713c8cd,Military says it has seized power in Madagascar after president moves to 'safe place',,"Military says it has seized power in Madagascar after president moves to 'safe place' Sammy Awami BBC Africa, Antananarivo and Danai Nesta Kupemba 'We have seized power,' says head of military unit An elite military unit says it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests in the Indian Ocean island. Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years. He also suspended key democratic institutions, like the electoral commission. Gen Z protestors will be part of the changes because ""the movement was created in the streets so we have to respect their demands"" he added. Troops and protesters have been celebrating the apparent ousting of President Rajoelina, with thousands waving flags in the capital, Antananarivo. CAPSAT stands for Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, and is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar. The unit supported Rajoelina when he came into power in 2009,  but joined the protesters on Saturday. Madagascar's constitutional court has named Col Randrianirina as the country's new leader, even though a statement from the president's office said he was still in charge and denounced what it described as an ""attempted coup d'etat"". Rajoelina's whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a ""safe place"" following an alleged attempt on his life by ""military personnel and politicians"".  CAPSAT has denied any involvement in any such move. There have been unconfirmed reports that the president was flown out of the country on a French military aircraft. Also on Tuesday the US state spartment urged all sides ""to pursue a peaceful solution in line with the constitutional order"". Col Randrianirina told the BBC that Madagascar was ""a country where chaos reigns right now"". ""Chaos because there's no president - he's gone abroad."" The unrest began just over two weeks ago, after a youth-led movement began protesting against chronic water and power cuts across the country. AFP via Getty Images Youth-led protests began over electricity cuts and water shortages The demonstrations soon escalated, to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, rampant corruption and the cost-of-living crisis. Protestors clashed with security forces resulting in the death of at least 22 people and more than 100 others injured, according to the UN, although the Malagasy government has dismissed those figures and described them as based on ""rumours and misinformation"". President Rajoelina, an entrepreneur and former DJ, was once seen as a fresh start for Madagascar. The baby-faced leader became president when he was just 34, earning the title of Africa's youngest leader, and going on to govern for four years, before returning to power after the 2018 election. AFP via Getty Images President Andry Rajoelina gave a speech on Monday via his Facebook page But he fell out of favour following allegations of cronyism and corruption, which he denied. Despite the fact that power appears to have shifted away from him, he has continued to try to influence events. Rajoelina attempted to dissolve the national assembly before the opposition could vote to strip him of his presidency for abandonment of post, but that did not work. Lawmakers voted to impeach Rajoelina by 130 votes to one blank ballot on Tuesday. Even members of his party, Irmar, voted overwhelmingly to impeach him. Rajoelina rejected the vote, calling it ""null and void"". The African Union (AU) has warned against soldiers ""meddling"" in Madagascar's political affairs and rejected ""any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government"". French President Emmanuel Macron called the situation ""greatly worrying"". The island has gone through a series of political upheavals in recent years. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of its 30 million people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.

b4339a11a2b1,"US strikes another vessel off Venezuela coast, killing six",,"US strikes another vessel off Venezuela coast, killing six Ione Wells South America Correspondent and Nadine Yousif BBC The US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to ""narcoterrorists"" and that it was ""trafficking narcotics."" This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them. Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes. In his Truth Social post, Trump said ""intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known"" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes. Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence, despite many lawyers questioning their legality.

ec06a66d3b1b,"D’Angelo, R&B Grammy-award winning singer, dies aged 51",,"Award-winning R&B singer Michael Eugene Archer, known to fans as D’Angelo, has died aged 51 after a cancer diagnosis, his family has said. In a statement, they said the star was leaving behind a ""legacy of extraordinarily moving music"" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”. The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won him four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked. ""The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,"" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US news partner. D’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the No. 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music scene. The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano at the age of three. Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.). When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI. He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo. However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died behind the wheel in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner. It went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016. Among those paying tribute were hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie. ""Such a sad loss,"" he wrote on social media. ""We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING."" 2020's Voodoo album topped the US charts and in their most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album. He had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq. Tributes have started to come in with hip hop star Tyler the Creator posting a black and white photo and Flavor Flav from Public Enemy calling him an icon.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynv40ly4vo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b2a8/live/16b62d00-a924-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T18:26:57.336000+00:00,085c9cc7e3fa3bb3995eb137e77a7e1778550506
5cad14cc82dc,French pair sentenced in Iran on spying charges,,"Two French nationals have been handed lengthy prison sentences by a court in Iran after being convicted of espionage, Iranian state media reports. The reports do not name the defendants but they are believed to be Cecile Kohler, 40, and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, the only French nationals being held in Iran. They were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip. The pair have been found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, the reports say. The announcement comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete. Iran has previously said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement. Another French tourist, Olivier Grondeau, 34, was released by Iran earlier this year after being handed a five-year prison sentence for ""conspiracy against the Islamic republic"". Iran's judicial news agency Mizan said one of the defendants was sentenced to six years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiracy against national security and 20 years in exile for ""intelligence co-operation"" with Israel. The other was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiring against national security and 20 years in exile for being complicit in intelligence co-operation with Israel. Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently. It is unclear what ""exile"" entails, though in other instances convicts have been sent to remote areas. Mizan reports that their pre-trial detention would be deducted from their sentences and that the verdict could be contested within 20 days. France has accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily and keeping them in conditions akin to torture. Iran denies the claims. Human rights groups say tourists and dual nationals are often held for leverage in diplomatic negotiations, released only when Iran gets something in return. The release of British-Iranian nationals Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in 2022 , after years in detention, came after months of negotiation that saw the UK settle a debt of nearly £400m dating from the 1970s. Kohler and Paris were touted as exchangeable for Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media. Iran has repeatedly called her detention arbitrary. Iran is thought to currently hold around 20 Europeans in detention, according to news agency AFP. These include British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were detained in January while travelling through Iran on a motorcycling world tour and later charged with espionage. Their family maintains they are innocent and are being held in ""horrific conditions"" . Last week, 18-year-old French-German cyclist Lennart Monterlos was released after an Iranian court acquitted him of espionage charges.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyplx3xz47o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7a4c/live/b4067340-a91e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-14T18:30:18.550000+00:00,39ed5ccc77d742fd9ce7a9a62f499a4b2854403d
e1941c429bed,US Supreme Court rejects Alex Jones appeal in Sandy Hook shooting case,,"The US Supreme Court has rejected a request from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to overturn the nearly $1.5bn (£1.1bn) defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to make the payout in 2022 for claiming the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School - which killed 20 schoolchildren and six educators - was a hoax. In order to make that payout, Jones was being forced to sell his Infowars media company to the satirical news site The Onion. He told the highest US court the sale would cause irreparable harm to him and his audience of 30 million. Jones has not yet paid any of the damages he owes Sandy Hook families. The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to deny his request. Jones’s lawyers had made a free speech argument - that he should have the same protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution that journalists have. And Jones argued the financial consequences were too steep. ""The result is a financial death penalty by fiat imposed on a media defendant whose broadcasts reach millions,"" he told the Supreme Court in the appeal. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement provided to BBC that the court “properly rejected Jones's latest desperate attempt to avoid accountability for the harm he has caused. We look forward to enforcing the jury's historic verdict and making Jones and Infowars pay for what they have done."" While The Onion's attempt to buy Infowars was rejected by a bankruptcy judge last year, Infowars could soon be up for sale again, giving The Onion another chance. Legal pressure against Jones has been mounting since he was found liable by two juries for defamation and emotional distress over his lies about the Sandy Hook school shooting. After the first verdict in Connecticut, Jones filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas, and Infowars was put up for auction to pay the Sandy Hook families, who had sued to collect on the judgment . It was during Texas court proceedings that Jones acknowledged the attack was ""100% real"". He had previously claimed the massacre was ""staged"" as part of a government plot to take guns from Americans and that ""no-one died"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypjjxd40qo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8cc8/live/55a70830-a916-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg,2025-10-14T17:12:21.475000+00:00,7b9be93d9e0a3fe948cc38e074625de0be43bda3
2827619680d1,Man who set fire to Pennsylvania governor’s mansion sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison,,"Man who set fire to Pennsylvania governor’s mansion sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison Getty Images An arsonist set fire to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence The man accused of setting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence on fire in April was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in state prison as part of a plea deal. Cody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other offenses at a court hearing on Tuesday. While the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged during the fire, people home at the time - including Shapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members - were able to escape unscathed. Shapiro said his family was supportive of the plea agreement announced by prosecutors. The attack against the governor and his family is part of a wave of political violence in the US, including attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the killings of two Minnesota state officials and the killing of commentator Charlie Kirk. At a press conference on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania governor - standing alongside his wife - said his family has had to lean on their faith as they navigated a difficult recovery since the attack. “We will forever be changed by this, we know that time will heal, but the scars will remain,” Shapiro said. Balmer was accused of breaking into the govenor's residence and setting it on fire on the second day of Passover. The governor, who is Jewish, had hosted a Passover celebration the night before. Getty Images An arsonist set fire to the Pennsylvania govenor's mansion Balmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said. He turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harboring hatred toward Governor Shapiro,” officials said. Balmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro. He told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer, according to an affidavit. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general. The Democrat was among the top picks to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 presidential election but was ultimately passed over. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdegnne8r3go,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/91bc/live/77adfe90-a91e-11f0-a87a-599d240e4891.jpg,2025-10-14T16:58:35.608000+00:00,5ad120ffdfd79f6766bd1dc53248222c6612fc8f
35391e93d534,Trump administration looks for ways to pay federal officers during shutdown,,"The Trump administration is looking for alternative ways to ensure federal law enforcement officers are paid as the government shutdown enters its third week. With Democrats and Republicans locked in a stalemate over the shutdown, officials in government are exploring alternative ways of paying for some key programmes, including a food programme for women and children. Members of the US military, meanwhile, will be paid using funds previously allocated to the Pentagon following an order from President Donald Trump. Thousands of federal workers have already been laid off, with Vice-President JD Vance warning of ""painful"" additional cuts should the shutdown continue. It is unclear how much money would be necessary to ensure that all federal law enforcement officers are paid. In response to a query from the BBC, a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget - or OMB - confirmed that it is examining alternative ways to ensure those payments continue. Like military personnel, federal law enforcement officers are considered ""essential"" and are still expected to report for duty, even without pay. They include officers from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), US Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Separately, on Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to use ""all available funds"" to get members of the military paid on 15 October, when they would have their pay withheld. While Trump provided no further details on where that money would be drawn from, an OMB spokesperson told the BBC that the funds would come from an amount previously allocated for defence research and development that is available for two years. Approximately 750,000 federal employees - about 40% of the total workforce - have so far been furloughed or sent home without pay. The administration has begun layoffs at least seven agencies, totalling about 4,000 workers so far. With both US political parties continuing to blame each other for the shutdown, the Trump administration has said it is seeking new ways to ensure that some essential services continue. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her department had found an ""innovative"" way to ensure members of the Coast Guard continue to be paid, although she provided no further details. Administration officials have also said tariff revenue would be used to fund the Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. More than 6.5m people across the country benefit from the programme, which provides food to women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum, as well as infants and children up to five years of age. The National WIC Association, however, said in a statement that the measure ""is not a permanent solution"" and that a prolonged shutdown could put millions of recipients at risk. Congressional Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce a bill that would ensure the programme remains fully funded, with Virginia Democrat Robert Scott telling the Guardian that it should be ""immune to the vagaries of the annual budget process"". The Senate plans to vote for an eighth time to fund the government on Tuesday afternoon, although it is unlikely to pass.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp55kkk2wo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/763d/live/2bb25ba0-a912-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg,2025-10-14T16:32:44.491000+00:00,018c14e73e93c3306943cc59e562f93b0bfab184
5a07bd6e7c64,24 hours with Trump on diplomatic tornado through Middle East,,"24 hours with Trump on diplomatic tornado through Middle East Tom Bateman State department correspondent travelling on Air Force One Watch: ""I'm talking about rebuilding Gaza"", Trump tells the BBC's Tom Bateman US President Donald Trump's day-long trip to the Middle East came as the Gaza deal was clinched: an agreement coming into force amounting to one of the most critical moments yet after two years of catastrophic war. Painting as he does in primary colours, Trump's portrayal was vivid - of the biggest turning point in three millennia. On the return flight in the early hours of Tuesday, he reflected that it had been a ""historic day, to put it mildly"". He had earlier suggested ""everlasting peace"" had been grasped under his tutelage, in a region long convulsed by violence. As part of the White House press corps, we were travelling on Air Force One – which is how I found myself at the centre of this US diplomatic tornado. As we headed for Tel Aviv, the presidential plane took a turn to do a fly-by of the beach. It dipped a wing so we could get a view of a giant sign atop the sand that said ""thank you"" to Trump, and featured the Israeli flag as well as an outline of the US president's head in profile. Reuters The manoeuvre set the mood for a trip that was a victory lap, rather than an exercise in setting out the punishing detail for starting ""phase two"" of the negotiations and securing a longer-term future for Gaza. The agreement made in Doha last week was under intensive pressure on the sides from Trump. It marked one of the most profound moments for millions of people in the last two years: major combat operations in Gaza ceased, the remaining living hostages held by Hamas released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and Palestinians in Gaza returning to the ruins of their homes in the north amid a partial withdrawal by Israeli troops. But I found Trump's journey was in fact to a waypoint, not a destination - a fragile truce in a century-old conflict which shows no real signs of being solved. The most immediate question hanging over the trip was whether Trump's deal could hold - and whether more intensive, arguably harder, negotiations could now build on it. During the flight, Trump came back to speak to us. Standing in the doorway as we crowded around, he clearly wanted to build up the sense of achievement, frequently referring to his own role in negotiating the deal. ""Every country is dancing in the streets,"" he said repeatedly. I pressed him on whether the ceasefire would stay intact. He was confident it would, saying there were ""a lot of reasons why it's going to hold"". But he glossed over the really big questions about what comes next, particularly how to secure and govern Gaza. I asked him about the proposed multinational force, or International Stabilization Force (ISF), outlined in his 20-point plan but whose existence has yet to be agreed by the sides. ""It's going to be a big, strong force,"" said Trump, adding that it would ""barely"" have to be used because ""people are going to behave, everybody knows their place"". On the tarmac in Tel Aviv, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted Trump with a red carpet and a military band. We then zoomed off in the motorcade towards Jerusalem, along the Route 1 motorway which had been completely cleared for the presidential convoy. The same day, thousands watched a giant screen in a public plaza in Tel Aviv that has become known as Hostages Square. They shed tears of joy and relief as the hostages were released by Hamas in Gaza. Trump's arrival was the other half of this split-screen moment – pictures were beamed out of the US president setting foot on Israeli territory. Getty Images Crowds in Tel Aviv watched side-by-side footage of the hostages' release and Trump's visit to Israel In the chamber of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the mood was altogether more raucous than that in the streets. Emblazoned on the red baseball caps handed out by staff, and worn by some of the audience, were the words: ""The president of peace"". Spectators shouted from the gallery behind me: ""Thank you Trump."" Lawmakers hammered their desks. Trump hailed a ""historic dawn of a new Middle East"". He also wanted to leave little doubt that the war was over, and it seemed he expected it to stay that way: Israel, he said, with America's help, had won all that it could ""by force of arms"". His speech meandered into extensive attacks on his political opponents in the US. He praised a major donor to his election campaign seated in the gallery. And he even appealed to Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, sitting next to him, to pardon Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption – charges that the Israeli PM denies. ""Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?"" Trump exclaimed, referencing the allegation that Netanyahu accepted pricy gifts. Watch: Emotional reunions as freed hostages return to Israel The White House press officers who chaperone the press pool - the ""wranglers"" - took us back into the media vans and the motorcade made its way back to Ben Gurion airport after fewer than seven hours in Israel. We took the short flight to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt; location of the mediated talks between Israel and Hamas that led to last week's breakthrough. On our descent, Egyptian F16s escorted us - the ultimate show for the president who loves displays of military might. Trump had wanted to celebrate every minute of the day. But the dangers in this region are many, and the risk seemed clear that he was declaring the ultimate deal before really landing it. That was reflected in the giant sign, written in capital letters, above the presidential podium in Sharm el-Sheikh: ""PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST"". There, I watched the extraordinary sight of world leaders filing into a room to stand behind Trump as he made his speech hailing peace. They lined up in front of their national flags and listened as he listed their countries one by one. Trump had been introduced to the stage by the host, Egyptian president Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, who said that the goal remained a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump has changed his position markedly since the start of this year. He became increasingly irritated by the Israeli leadership and was drawn closer to his friends in the Gulf. That came amid a diplomatic move by the Europeans to isolate Israel over its escalating campaign in Gaza and to get the Saudi leadership onboard with their vision. Trump then shifted, drawn by his Gulf allies – whose wealth and ""power"" he frequently referred to during the trip. Trump presided over the signing ceremony in Sharm saying it had taken ""3,000 years"" to get here. But there are still many more years to go - and it will take more than one man to get there.

Rotem Cooper, whose father Amiram is among 24 hostages whose bodies were not returned to Israel on Monday, said the families were trying ""to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight"". He called on US President Donald Trump, Qatar, Egypt and other countries involved in peace deal negotiations ""to show Hamas that this is not acceptable"". A ceasefire and hostage release agreement signed by Israel and Hamas stated that the remaining hostages in Gaza would be returned by noon on Monday, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel released in exchange. While the 20 hostages still alive were released, a copy of the agreement published by Israeli media appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of the bodies of the deceased hostages by the deadline. Their families had pinned their hopes on their loved one returning on Monday, after two years in captivity. ""We hoped and expected that maybe 15 to 20 out of the 28 deceased hostages would be released, but that didn't happen. Only four were announced,"" Mr Cooper said. Family handout Amiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023 He described the news as a ""very big disappointment"" for the families. ""It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and [that] they're playing games."" Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were ""under examination"". Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike. AFP via Getty Images Dozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on Monday The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for ""a very serious response"" from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's ""violation of the agreement"". It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned. Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages. In recorded voice messages sent throughout the day, he described feeling ""tremendous anticipation"" and a ""big relief"" as he saw them return. But he added that the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was ""heartbreaking"". Family handout Ruby Chen (R) with his son Itay (L), whose body still remains in Gaza Speaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a ""big rollercoaster"". Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have ""some closure"" and to ""sleep better at night"". ""Everything has been on hold,"" he said. Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions. ""We were overjoyed [on Monday] to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out,"" he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. ""We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere [to] and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity,"" Mr Chen added. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied.

On Tuesday morning, the Israeli military named two of the hostages as Guy Illouz, a 26-year-old Israeli, and Bipin Joshi, a Nepalese citizen who was 23. Later, the two other hostages were named by their families as Yossi Sharabi, a 53-year-old Israeli, and Daniel Peretz, 22, Israeli-South African dual national. Meanwhile, Israeli officials said the government would restrict the entry of aid into Gaza and delay the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt over Hamas's failure to hand over the bodies of the 24 other dead hostages on Monday. Israel's defence minister has said that ""any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly"". Hamas has said it could take time because not all the hostages' burial sites are known. The 20 remaining living hostages were released by the Palestinian armed group on Monday in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday morning that, following forensic testing, representatives had informed the families of Guy Illouz, Bipin Joshi and two other hostages that they had been brought back to Israel for burial. The IDF said Illouz, a sound technician in the Israeli music industry from the central town of Ra'anana, was ""injured and abducted alive"" by Hamas gunmen after he escaped the attack on the Nova musical festival on 7 October 2023. ""Guy died from his wounds after not receiving proper medical treatment while held captive by Hamas,"" it added. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel cited released hostage Maya Regev as saying that Illouz was ""kidnapped unconscious and lay alone for a whole week, tied to his bed."" ""A day and a half before his death, she was brought into his room at the hospital, where he told her that his mother was the strongest woman in the world, and that the moment he returned home he would hug her and never let go."" Bipin Joshi was an agriculture student who had only been in Israel for a few weeks when Kibbutz Alumim was attacked by Hamas gunmen two years ago. According to the Hostages Families Forum, he ""fled to a shelter in the kibbutz with other foreign students, deflected a live grenade with his bare hands , and through his bravery saved many lives"". The IDF said it had assessed that Joshi was ""murdered in captivity during the first months of the war"". Hostages and Missing Families Forum The bodies of Bipin Joshi and Guy Illouz were handed over by Hamas in Gaza on Monday On Tuesday evening, the Hostages Families Forum said in a statement that it embraced the families of Daniel Peretz and Yossi Sharabi following their ""return... to Israel yesterday for a proper burial"". Yossi Sharabi was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October along with his brother, Eli, whose British-Israeli wife and two daughters were killed. Last year, the IDF said an investigation had found that Yossi was likely to have been killed when a building collapsed following an Israeli strike on another building nearby. Eli was released by Hamas in February 2025 during the last ceasefire deal. Daniel Peretz, who emigrated from South Africa to Israel when he was 13 and lived in the central town of Yad Binyamin, was a captain in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade. He was killed in an attack on his tank near Nahal Oz on 7 October and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage, the IDF said last year. Final conclusions about the deaths of the men would be determined after forensic examinations had been competed, the Israeli military said. The Hostages Families Forum said the return of their bodies ""brings some measure of comfort to families who have lived with agonising uncertainty and doubt for over two years"". ""We will not rest until all 24 hostages are brought home,"" it added. The IDF expressed condolences to their families and pledged to continue to make every effort to return the remains of the hostages in line with the ceasefire agreement. ""Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to proper burial,"" it warned. Later, Israeli officials told Reuters news agency that Israeli authorities had decided to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed and to reduce deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory until all the bodies were returned. The UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, told the BBC that Hamas had to ""get the bodies home, as they promised"", but also that Israel had to keep crossings into Gaza open in order for ""desperately needed"" aid to be delivered. Hostages and Missing Families Forum Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz's remains were also returned to Israel on Monday Hamas has not yet issued a statement explaining the delay, but a senior Palestinian source told the BBC on Tuesday that the group's negotiators were meeting mediators in Egypt to try to resolve the issue. According to Hamas officials, some of the hostages' bodies remain trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israeli bombardment and demolitions, and the group has requested the entry of heavy machinery to help with the recovery efforts. A copy of the ceasefire agreement published by Israeli media last week appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian groups might not be able to locate all the bodies before the deadline of 12:00 local time (09:00) on Monday. It established a mechanism between the two sides through the mediators and the Red Cross, which would allow them to exchange information and intelligence on the locations of the remains of any deceased hostages not retrieved before the deadline. The Red Cross warned on Tuesday that the search could take days or weeks. ""The search for human remains is obviously an even bigger challenge than having the people alive being released,"" spokesman Christian Cardon told journalists in Geneva. ""I think there is clearly a risk that that will take much more time. What we are telling the parties is that that should be their top priority,"" he added. Separately, Nasser hospital in southern Gaza said it had received the remains of 45 dead Palestinians held by Israel on Tuesday. There was no announcement from Israeli authorities, but the ceasefire deal said they would exchange the bodies of 15 Palestinians for every dead Israeli hostage. Fears are growing among Palestinians that the delay over the return of hostages' bodies could derail the ceasefire. Tayseer Abed, a well-known writer who has chronicled the war from his tent in the southern city of Khan Younis, described it as ""a dangerous test"". If the delay continued and Israel refused to move to the next phase of Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan, ""the corpses issue could become the fuse that ignites a new round of conflict"", he warned. Palestinians also expressed concern about the continued deadly violence in Gaza. On Tuesday, medics and first responders said Israeli drone fire killed five Palestinians as they went to check houses in the eastern Gaza City neighbourhood of Shejaiya. Another person was killed in an Israeli strike east of Khan Younis, they said. The IDF said it fired on suspects who were ""identified crossing the yellow line"" - the withdrawal line inside Gaza that was agreed in the ceasefire agreement - and approached its troops in a manner that constituted a threat. A Hamas spokesman accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 67,913 people have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27ye11ey2o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8bcd/live/c3bc7820-a928-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-14T19:08:39.735000+00:00,55ae4f47ba29ef6761e8a380ec5b24ff459cfedd
291d7dd8017e,Prostate cancer symptoms and treatment: What to check for,,"Prostate cancer symptoms and treatment: What to check for Michelle Roberts Digital health editor Getty Images Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has told the BBC that a targeted prostate cancer screening programme is needed urgently, and would ""save countless lives"". Sunak is an ambassador for the Prostate Cancer Research charity, and made his comments as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its 2020 decision not to recommend routine screening. Not everyone thinks extending screening a good idea though. Prostate cancers can behave very differently, and while some can spread quickly, others are very slow growing and may need minimal or even no treatment. What is prostate cancer? The prostate is a gland that is about the size of a walnut which sits just below the bladder within the pelvis. It surrounds the urethra - the tube that takes urine out of the body through the penis. Prostate cancer - abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth - often develops slowly. There may be no signs or symptoms for years and some people never develop any problems from it. But in others, the cancer can be aggressive and deadly. Prostate cancer that's detected early has the best chance for successful treatment. Getty Images How common is prostate cancer? Prostate Cancer UK says one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. Around 52,300 men are diagnosed each year in the UK, and there are around 12,200 prostate cancer deaths every year, according to Cancer Research UK. It is most common in older age - among men over 75. Cases in the under-50s are rare. Your risk of prostate cancer is higher if you have a close relative - a father, brother, grandfather or uncle - who has had prostate cancer. It is also more common in black men. Getty Images Former track cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has advanced, incurable prostate cancer What symptoms should people check for? The common ones are: needing to urinate more frequently - particularly at night difficulty starting to urinate, weak flow and it taking a long time blood in urine or semen These symptoms can be caused by other conditions too - but it is important to have any changes checked by a doctor. We explain what warning signs to look out for Is there a test for prostate cancer? There is no single, diagnostic test. Doctors make a diagnosis based on various measures. This can include a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and a scan, as well as a biopsy, which involves taking a small tissue sample to examine in the laboratory. PSA tests are not routinely used to screen healthy men for prostate cancer because the results can be unreliable. A high PSA does not always mean cancer. It can go up if there is an infection, for example. Some men with a raised PSA may have a prostate cancer that would not have caused problems or needed treatment, causing unnecessary worry and further investigations. Men over 50 can usually ask their GP for a PSA blood test if they want to. Your GP will explain the potential benefits and risks of having a PSA test. If you decide you want a PSA test, you should refrain from sexual activity and vigorous exercise, such as cycling, in the two days beforehand as this can affect the results. Doctors are also considering whether adding MRI scans to PSA tests might improve the situation. Would a prostate screening programme help? Researchers have repeatedly looked at whether it would be beneficial to introduce the screening. Those studies, overall, show that offering all men of a certain age a PSA test would only lead to a small reduction in the number of men dying from prostate cancer. In 2020, the UK National Screening Committee said it did not recommend screening for the condition. However, the latest report from Prostate Cancer Research calls for a screening programme targeted at men aged 45–69 with a family history of prostate cancer and black men. This group includes around 1.3 million men in the UK. The charity estimates the programme would cost £25 million a year - or about £18 per patient - similar to bowel and breast cancer screening. It says the benefits of introducing targeted screening for those at the highest risk would outweigh the financial and logistical costs. But others have argued that it would take scanning capacity away from patients being treated for other conditions. Some medical experts are sceptical about the value of screening. They argue there is still a risk that patients will be treated for the cancer when it is not strictly necessary and will then have to live with side effects such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. How is prostate cancer treated? Different options are available and your doctor will be able to advise which might be most suitable. If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms or growing quickly, it might be possible to keep it under observation or ""watch and wait"". Some prostate cancers can be cured with treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy. Hormone therapy may also slow cancer growth. It may also be possible to destroy the cancer cells using extreme cold (cryotherapy) or high-intensity focused ultrasound.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2plvp341jo,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2357/live/e7e95930-a8d7-11f0-a522-95977dce8b09.jpg,2025-10-14T08:42:25.281000+00:00,11c0a912c752b924342982ea02940cfc9f422e80

ba29de9cfb86,Muscat leads race to become new Rangers head coach,,"During a 19-year playing career that yielded 123 bookings and 12 red cards, Muscat was once branded the ""most hated man in football"". Post-retirement, he revealed , external former Rangers manager Alex McLeish did not trust him to play in an Old Firm derby during his brief spell at Ibrox. It is to the Australian's credit that he has since gone on to somewhat shake off his hot-head image in an impressive 13 years in management. His glowing CV attracted Rangers two years ago, but he reportedly missed out on the job when the club opted for Philippe Clement instead. At that time, former Rangers team-mate Neil McCann told BBC Scotland that the Ibrox side would be getting someone with ""presence"" who ""understands the league, the intensity, the rivalry and how to get the job done"". Muscat was then first-team boss at Yokohama F Marinos, where he won 2022 J-League after taking over from Ange Postecoglou following his exit for Celtic. He also succeeded Postecoglou at Melbourne Victory after a period working under the current Nottingham Forest head coach. It was in Melbourne where Muscat's managerial career began, winning the A-League Championship twice in five-and-a-half years before his move to Japan. Runners-up spots in the J-League in 2021 and 2023 bookended his 2022 triumph in Yokohama. Muscat became a title winner in a third different country last year in China, and he is on the verge of another with just four games remaining as his side sit top with a two-point lead. Across his managerial tenures in Australia, Japan and China, his win rate stands at 54%, with his teams scoring an average of 1.9 goals per game while conceding 1.2. His Shanghai Port side scored 96 times in a 30-game league-winning campaign last year. Those numbers suggest this is a coach who can win while implementing a front-foot approach.

f59fd6346a24,Key questions as Farrell set to name Ireland squad,,"With Keenan out, Jamie Osborne is in a strong position to be the starting 15 next month. Osborne, of course, can be used at centre, and if Farrell wishes to test the 23-year-old there, he has other options at full-back. Jimmy O'Brien started at 15 against Georgia and Portugal, while Mack Hansen has played there on several occasions for Connacht. Moving Hansen to full-back would also pave the way for Tommy O'Brien to be given another chance on the right wing. The 27-year-old scored four tries while wearing 14 on the summer tour. Ciaran Frawley and Jacob Stockdale - who started at 15 in Ulster's win over the Bulls last weekend - are other potential Keenan deputies. Farrell may also look to shake things up in midfield. Bundee Aki, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw and Stuart McCloskey are all in their 30s, so Farrell may include 21-year-old Connacht centre Hugh Gavin with long-term planning in mind. In terms of his pack, Farrell may want a closer look at 6ft 9ins lock Thomas Ahern. The Munster man can play in the second or back rows and featured for interim boss Paul O'Connell in the summer.

7368537a0410,The Wales bolters on Tandy's radar for autumn squad,,"Bowen is one of URC's hottest finishers and Cardiff team-mate Callum Sheedy is racking up the assists with five so far. The fly-half, 29, put his teenage wing over with a peach of a pass with his hands at Munster, but has also laid on three tries with his right boot. The 16-times capped playmaker is staking a claim, but his goalkicking success of 55% is not good enough, while it could be argued that Ospreys' Dan Edwards deserves to be properly backed this November. Cardiff's Jacob Beetham is another who could be in the mix after slotting in at full-back, centre and wing so far this season. He was capped against South Africa in 2024 and the 24-year-old, who is 6ft 1ins, will be keen to push to the next level as an international under his former club boss Matt Sherratt, the new Wales attack coach. Keiran Williams ' only cap came when given a cameo against England in a World Cup warm-up at Twickenham in 2023, but he continues to impress for Ospreys. Relatively small but tough to put down, the centre has made 48 carries so far this season, beaten 11 defenders, made 113 metres to score two tries and provided an assist. Is he another who will just be a top-end club player? Williams' hopes are probably harmed by the presence of Ben Thomas and Johnny Williams. Nick Tompkins has made an impressive start to the season with Saracens, scoring three tries from three appearances at outside centre. The 30-year-old's last start at international level was Gatland's final game and he did not tour Japan after Thomas, Johnny Williams, Joe Roberts and Macs Page were selected. However, the 41-times capped back's experience and defensive solidity could be useful for a new regime. If Tandy wants to create a tough team then three-times capped Dragons back row Shane Lewis-Hughes is worthy of consideration. The no-nonsense 28-year-old, who had the ring finger on his right hand amputated last season because a previous injury had led to frequent pain, might not rack up eye-catching statistics, but provides honest graft and has profited from working closely with Wales legend and Dragons coach Dan Lydiate.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cn7el78l18xo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/1a11/live/926d7fc0-a8fc-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png,2025-10-14T16:39:33.288000+00:00,5813d23c854fc9cc0d02ef2622d1417be2483c5b

""Certainly the World Cup will be on a lot of the players' minds. That's the next big one, isn't it? The Euros is fantastic, a great occasion, but the World Cup is that little bit more special. ""For the majority of them, to experience the Euros and the World Cup would be enough ignition for the fire."" Some of Wales' leading players are nearing the end of their careers, with record cap holder and goalscorer Jess Fishlock now 38 years old and former captain Sophie Ingle recently turning 34. Striker Kayleigh Barton has already announced her retirement, and Wilkinson suggested last month that other senior figures could follow suit. ""Age doesn't escape any of us, so I think there'll be some members of the squad who maybe think they've got one more campaign and then potentially there will be one or two who do call it a day now,"" said Ward. ""But I think the majority of that squad that was in the Euros will want to push on and get themselves to that World Cup. ""It's another carrot, another target, another central moment of history. I don't think there'll be too many [retirements], I hope there's not too many, and I think we'll be ready to go when qualifying starts again.

aa692214114f,"Tommy Robinson police stop unlawful, court hears",,"Far-right activist Tommy Robinson was unlawfully stopped driving a Bentley at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, and counter-terrorism officers made a disproportionate use of their powers, his lawyer has told a court. The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is standing trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court for refusing to give the Pin for his mobile phone to officers during the stop. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Jo Morris said that while the stop may not have been ""perfect"", that does not mean it was unlawful. Judgement in the trial has been delayed until 4 November following closing arguments. If found guilty, Mr Lennon could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine. He was stopped by police on 28 July, 2024, using their counter-terrorism powers as he prepared to enter the Channel Tunnel while driving a silver Bentley Bentayga. Officers from Kent Police said they did so partly because he was driving someone else's car and had not pre-booked his ticket. They said they became more suspicious when Mr Lennon would not make eye contact with them and said he was driving all the way to Benidorm. When asked for the Pin to his phone he refused. A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices. In his closing submissions to the judge on Tuesday, Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, said: ""The question for you. Is this a lawful stop? If it is not, you cannot convict Mr Lennon."" Mr Williamson described the power that police officers have at ports and airport as ""extraordinary"" and said there needed to be ""assiduous oversight"" of this power, which he described as the only one there was to ""compel people under pain of criminal penalty to answer questions"". He described Mr Lennon as a ""public figure"" whose views are ""well known"" and asked what the justification was for the police's use of ""coercive powers"". ""What were they going to find out that wasn't in the public domain?"" Mr Williamson asked. He pointed out that the officers did not ask any further questions about the Bentley after Mr Lennon told them it belonged to ""a mate"" and said his client travelled to Benidorm regularly. In her closing speech, prosecutor Jo Morris said ""we accept that the stop may not have been a perfect one but that does not make it unlawful"". She said ""there was no real dispute over the facts"" and that Mr Lennon had been warned of the consequences and was offered legal advice but still refused to give officers his Pin. Before the hearing began on Monday, Mr Lennon - the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) - said on X that the social media platform's billionaire owner, Elon Musk - who has previously championed him - had ""picked up the legal bill"" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as ""state persecution"".

Julia Wandelt and Karen Spragg are on trial at Leicester Crown Court charged with stalking Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann. On Tuesday, jurors heard DNA was taken from Ms Wandelt on her arrest in February 2025, and the result given to her in Peterborough Prison in April, which she disputed when told. Ms Wandelt, 24, of Jana Kochanowskiego in Lubin, Poland, and Mrs Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road, Cardiff, deny the charges. PA Media Madeleine McCann's disappearance has never been solved Madeleine's disappearance at the age of three in Portugal in 2007 is one of the most widely reported missing child cases and remains unsolved. Ms Wandelt, who the court has heard since 2022 has claimed to be Madeleine, and her co-defendant Mrs Spragg deny stalking the McCanns, causing serious alarm and distress. In December 2024, Det Ch Insp Mark Cramwell decided Operation Grange - the name of the force's investigation into Madeleine's disappearance - should attempt to get Ms Wandelt's DNA tested ""in the hope she may stop her behaviour towards the McCann family"". He said: ""It weighed heavy on my mind. The threshold remained the same, but it was outside the framework."" DNA samples were then taken on arrest, the court heard, and Det Ch Insp Cramwell said: ""It conclusively proved that Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann."" Ms Wandelt being Madeleine had been ruled out of the Operation Grange investigation after Ms Wandelt contacted them and Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, where Mr McCann works, in June 2022. But after press coverage of Ms Wandelt's claim ""gained traction"" later that year, a photo of her was sent to the McCanns, with their family liaison officer Det Sgt Roger Bearn saying via statement they both replied they ""were confident"" it was not their daughter. Details of the Met Police's discussions about Ms Wandelt were detailed to the court, from initial contact to the press coverage, to Mrs McCann being ""bombarded"" with calls and texts. PA Media The Met Police has run the Operation Grange investigation into the Madeleine McCann case for about a decade and a half In September 2024, Det Sgt Bearn asked the McCanns if they wanted to pursue ""some sort of action"" but said ""words of advice"" would not be advisable, as Ms Wandelt had previously recorded a call with an Operation Grange officer and played it on a true crime podcast on YouTube. No formal action was asked for at that time. Ms Wandelt claimed to be Madeleine and pursued the McCann family with messages, calls, and visits, including turning up at their home and demanding a DNA test, the court has heard. In October, Det Sgt Bearn's statement said that messages from Ms Wandelt had continued as well as two from a ""Welsh-sounding woman"". Prosecutor Michael Duck KC said Mrs Spragg struck up a relationship with Ms Wandelt and supported her claims and conspiracy theories, and alongside the Polish national confronted the McCanns directly in December 2024. Mrs Spragg recorded a message she left on Mrs McCann's phone in late 2024 - prior to their visit to the McCanns' home in Leicestershire - which was played at the trial on Tuesday. She said that people believed there was a ""cover-up"" and that the McCanns' names had been ""blackened"" and urged the couple to do a DNA test with Ms Wandelt. In the recording Mrs Spragg can be heard saying: ""I really, really want you to take her seriously if you really want to find your daughter. ""This could be a cover-up. Maybe Orange Grange [sic] is in on it."" A crime report was created by the Met Police after Ms Wandelt and an ""older woman"" turned up at the McCanns' home in December 2024.

023e474cb4b2,GPs question SNP plans for new drop-in services,,"GPs question SNP plans for new drop-in services Mary McCool and Aimee Stanton BBC Scotland Getty Images John Swinney has promised to open 15 new walk-in services across Scotland Leading doctors have questioned how the Scottish government plans to staff 15 new drop-in services run by GPs and nurses. First Minister John Swinney announced plans to roll out the first site ""within the year"" during his keynote speech at the SNP conference in Aberdeen. But the vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in Scotland told the BBC he was ""not immediately clear"" on where the workforce would come from, particularly as Scotland's GP workforce is smaller than it was a decade ago. Dr Chris Williams also said that Swinney's promise to provide one million more appointments in a year was ""not that large"" compared to the current level of general practice activity. Meanwhile the chair of the RCGP in Scotland, Dr Chris Provan, also told the BBC that the body had not been consulted on the plans. What do we know about GP walk-in services? John Swinney says the SNP government will open a nationwide network of walk-in GP services Swinney's announcement on Monday was light on detail, but he was clear that the plan was designed to tackle the ""8am rush"" for appointments. The SNP leader said the services would be staffed by GPs and nurses. They would also operate from noon until 20:00 seven days a week, with no appointment required. This means, Swinney said, more people could go after work ""when it fits with their lives"". Initially there will be 15 of these walk-in centres launched across Scotland, with the first minister promising to expand the number. The locations, however, have not yet been confirmed. Swinney said they would be based in communities, ""on your local high street, near your child's school, or close to your workplace"". He also said the first site would be up and running within the year. How many GPs does Scotland have? The number of GPs by headcount in Scotland has actually increased in the last 10 years - from 4,393 in 2015 to 4,582 in 2025 - but this does not take into account whether they work full-time or part-time. Another way to measure the workforce is by looking at whole time equivalents (WTEs) - a unit that measures the number of full-time positions. Scotland's WTE figure has decreased between 2015 and 2025, from 3,675.1 to 3,591.5. The number of GP practices in Scotland has also fallen by 10% over the past decade, from 987 in July 2015 to 885 in July 2025. Dr Williams said the Scottish government's plan to introduce drop-in services may be ""central belt based"" and designed to ""take advantage of a perceived workforce that is under-employed"". At the moment, a range of healthcare professionals - GPs, nurses and more - provide 720,000 appointments a week in Scotland. A key part of Swinney's pledge was that the new walk-in services would offer one million more appointments per year. But Dr Williams said this was not a large number. He added: ""Without knowing the specifics it's difficult to know how this [plan] could reach anything like the current activity that we have in general practice."" Asked who was going to staff the walk-in services, Scotland's health secretary Neil Gray said that there were a ""record"" 1,200 GPs currently in training. He said: ""I've been told by general practitioners that we have GPs that are looking for employment. ""We believe that this is something that we can work with the profession on ensuring we can staff both with GPs and on advanced nurse practitioners and practice nurses, and ensuring we've got a model that suits the needs of the people that are coming to see them."" Gray was also asked whether it was a mistake that the Scottish government did not consult the RCGP. He said: ""We are looking to make sure that we're able to work with them ahead of this being piloted and ensure that we're providing a system that is workable."" Though Dr Williams said he was keen to understand how the walk-in service plans would work, he said the best way to give patients timely access to quality care was by giving more funding and resources to general practice. He said drop-ins would suit ""a small number of people with some specific medical issues"". But he added that the ""vast majority"" of people would get the best experience from their GP if they were able to book an appointment with someone who knows them. Are drop-ins available elsewhere in the UK? Walk-in services were first introduced by the Labour government in 2008. They have been more widely available in England for around 15 years, though many closed after the Conservatives came into power in 2010. They are currently commissioned on a local level, run by individual boards and their opening hours vary. In 2007, a paper in the British Medical Journal , based on a study by the University of Bristol, claimed walk-in services did not have a ""meaningful impact on the demand for general practice"". It warned the services may lead to extra consultations and said they may not necessarily lead to changes in waiting times. The article also said the overall effect on the NHS would be ""negligible"" because of the volume of people attending the services. Dr Williams said that drop in clinics in England ""weren't greatly efficient"" and did not provide the impact that had been hoped for. Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives' health spokesperson Dr Sandesh Gulhane described Swinney's plan as a ""back-of-a-fag-packet"" policy that he will be unable to deliver. He said: ""The SNP are completely detached from the reality facing staff and patients across Scotland's NHS and have no real vision to fix the permanent crisis within the health service."" Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie also criticised the walk-in appointments pledge and said it was as though the first minister had ""only just discovered"" the NHS crisis. She added: ""After 18 years in power, if John Swinney and the SNP had the ideas to fix Scotland's NHS, they would have done it by now.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d5e950ego,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9a75/live/67336fb0-2416-11f0-9f6a-cdae3e54785e.jpg,2025-10-14T17:16:54.415000+00:00,9d50d265af8df641d6427cb5b7e634c0f0445cab
c2e4c6e15951,Boy who died in hotel pool 'had no sense of danger',,"Boy who died in hotel pool 'had no sense of danger' David Grundy BBC Wales, Pontypridd Coroner's Court Family photo Theo Treharne-Jones was on holiday with his parents, siblings and extended family A five-year-old boy who drowned during a family holiday in Greece was an ""excitable, happy, loving little child"" with ""no sense of danger"", an inquest has heard. Theo Treharne-Jones, from Merthyr Tydfil, was found unconscious in a swimming pool at Atlantica Holiday Village in Kos on 15 June 2019. His mother, Nina Treharne, told Pontypridd Coroner's Court her son had been diagnosed with Smith-Magenis syndrome and had displayed ""autistic behaviours"" which may have made him less naturally cautious. The inquest will look at how Theo was able to leave the hotel room unaccompanied, after his mother revealed there was no door chain, and whether there should have been more security at the pool. The family had stayed at the same hotel nine months earlier but Ms Treharne told assistant coroner Gavin Knox the rooms were different to the ones they had stayed in previously. ""The door had no chain lock in this room,"" said Ms Treharne, relating how she had placed her two sons' buggy and a suitcase against the door ""as a precaution"". She recounted how the family had gone to bed after dinner the night before Theo was found in the water and were woken up by shouting in the morning. ""There was banging and someone was shouting: 'There's a child in the pool, there's a child in the pool.' It was like waking up to a nightmare."" Guests carried out CPR Theo's father, Richard Jones, said when the alarm was raised, he ran down to the pool area ""expecting to find Theo sitting at the side of the pool"" and was ""shocked"" to see someone doing CPR on his son on a nearby sunlounger. Theo was subsequently moved to the floor, where resuscitation efforts continued before the ambulance arrived. In a statement, Stuart Zammitto-Nicholl, who found Theo face down in the water, said he was doing CPR for five minutes but ""it felt like forever"". Search for defibrillator The inquest heard that fellow hotel guest Tracey Wheedon also carried out CPR on Theo while others searched for a defibrillator. She said the ambulance crew arrived without a stretcher and that his father had to carry him to the vehicle. Adam Holmes, who owns a first aid training business and was staying at the hotel, said he gave advice on carrying out CPR. He said he carried out chest compressions but there were ""no signs of any breathing"" and was concerned at how long it was taking for the defibrillator to arrive. Mr Holmes asked reception about the defibrillator before it emerged. It was at a nearby doctor's surgery and he ran to collect it, the hearing was told. Mr Knox asked Mr Holmes if anyone else would have gone to get the machine if he had not done so, to which he responded ""it wouldn't seem so, no"". He said the defibrillator went through three cycles and each time no shock was administered. Mr Holmes also accompanied Theo and his father in the ambulance to hospital and continued carrying out chest compressions while Mr Jones used a bag valve and mask to push oxygen into Theo's lungs. Mr Knox said he wanted to investigate the suitability of the door-locking mechanism on the hotel bedrooms, and what information was available about how any mechanism worked. While giving evidence, Dr Patrick Morgan, a consultant in anaesthetic and pre-hospital care, said witness accounts suggested the five-year-old got into difficulty in the swimming pool at around 08:41. He said that due to the lack of oxygen and the time he had been in the water, it would have ""made no difference to the outcome whether the defibrillator was there or not"". He said Theo was last seen at 08:40 and the emergency services were called at 08:51. He said it was likely that Theo had been in the water for ""two to five minutes"" before resuscitation started and that it was likely the initial submersion in the water was ""enough to prove fatal"". When asked if the outcome would be different if the ambulance arrived sooner, he said he would have arrived at the hospital earlier but the responder's training and equipment ""was not sufficient"". He added had a two-person ambulance crew being at the scene as soon as Theo was rescued from the water, where ""at least one [crew member] had a high level of training, with the right equipment and the right interventions"" he might have survived. The inquest heard the pools at the hotel were open and staffed by lifeguards between 10:00 and 18:00 daily. Libby Jones, General Manager for Overseas Health and Safety at TUI, explained the company audits the compliance of hotels against safety standards in what's known as the ""blue book"". She explained that the ""blue book"" is the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) Tourism Accommodation Health & Safety Technical Guide, which provides comprehensive guidance on safety and risk management for the tourism industry. An audit was carried out the day before Theo's death where two issues where highlighted: one around the lack of clear markings on the steps down to the pool and another with a ladder. She told the inquest that neither of those issues was deemed to be ""critical"" meaning there was not a risk to life or potential for major injury. On security and safety guidance, she said there was a note in the guidance that a security chain or latch ""could be provided"". Ms Jones said TUI had considered whether it was possible, practical or safe to install chains on all its hotels' doors but ""it was deemed too great of a fire risk"". The inquest will resume on Wednesday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5q4x7lw45o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c2b8/live/58379bc0-a8e2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-14T15:52:41.392000+00:00,8b4bbca2418854d922486058fee5775c5699d687
bd9849de93a8,The players with points to prove as England reach World Cup,,"It is inconceivable that Jude Bellingham will not be part of England's squad at the World Cup but does the Real Madrid star, who is arguably the biggest global name available to Thomas Tuchel, still have something to prove to the head coach? The recent evidence on and off the pitch suggests he does. It all stems from Bellingham being left out of England's latest squad despite telling Tuchel he wanted to be included, to the constant narrative of team spirit and the excellence of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the number 10 role. England's next squad for what are effectively dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania will now have one main point of interest, namely whether Bellingham is included. If he is, Bellingham will return to duty having been made acutely aware by Tuchel that there is no star system, no special cases, no automatic route back into England's team. And it will also come after it has been made crystal clear that Tuchel's England world does not revolved around Bellingham and how best to utilise his undoubted talent. Bellingham is not exactly starting again with England - the odds will still be on him being in the line-up their first game in next summer's World Cup - but he has to prove to Tuchel that he can be part of the team spirit the German cherishes, and that he deserves his place back in the side.

That's nine in a row now. 6.5 Djed Spence â Has taken to international football like a duck to water. Sterner tests lie ahead, of course, but a good start to his England career. 7 John Stones â Two games in five days will do the Manchester City defender a world of good. Still one of the first names on the team-sheet, fitness permitting. 7 Ezri Konza â Selected ahead of Marc Guehi and didn't put a foot wrong. Made an excellent last-ditch recovery tackle in the second half to boot. 7 Myles Lewis-Skelly â Looked a little ring rusty at times, understandable given his lack of action at Arsenal. An interesting few months ahead. 6 Elliott Anderson â Looks undroppable in this England team at the moment. Looks made for this level and has struck up an excellent partnership with Rice. 7 Declan Rice â Enjoying his nuumber eight role. The mainstay of England's midfield is showing his attacking abilities now. Emerging us a genuine all-round midfielder. 7 Morgan Rogers â Not as impactful as he has been in England's victories over Serbia and Wales. We should find out next month who is the true owner of the number 10 shirt. 6 Bukayo Saka â Added an assist to his excellent goal against Wales last Thursday. Will be crucial to England's chances next summer. 7.5 Harry Kane â In the form of his life. Took his tally for the season to 20 goals. Has hit the back of the net 76 times for his country.

b02e7a64f16c,All you need to know about 2026 World Cup,,"The first batch of tickets went on sale at the start of October, with more than 4.5m fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them. Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues. General admission tickets are being split into four categories, with those for the first match in the USA costing between $560 (Â£417) and $2,235 (Â£1,662). The cheapest ticket for the 2026 final costs $2,030 (Â£1,510), and the most expensive is $6,000 (Â£4,462). Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher. Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (Â£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats. The second phase of ticketing will begin on Monday, 27 October, with the Early Ticket Draw that will run until 31 October. This will involve an application process followed by a randomised selection. A random selection draw will take place shortly after the groups are drawn on 5 December, during which fans can apply for specific matches. A last-minute sales phase will take place closer to the tournament, during which fans will be able to purchase any remaining inventory on a first come, first served basis. Fifa is adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods.

An undercover policing inquiry heard the Metropolitan force put the family under surveillance ""almost immediately"" after the 18-year-old was killed in a racist attack in 1993. Barrister Ifeanyi Odogwu, on behalf of Neville Lawrence, that while the family ""sought justice, state power turned on the family"". The inquiry into undercover policing is looking at the activities of the Met's Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) between 1993 and 2007. Officers gathered information about the Lawrence family, including that their  marriage had broken down during the public inquiry into their son's death, and details about the couple's civil claim against the Met. Mr Odogwu told the hearing that from the days after Stephen's murder in April 1993, SDS officers began ""collecting and circulating intimate information about the Lawrences and those assisting them"". He said the activity continued for years and reached into the Macpherson Inquiry - a 1999 inquiry into Stephen's murder and the subsequent police investigation - and it was ""truly abhorrent and shocking"" that personal information about the couple was passed to officers. Neville Lawrence described the surveillance on his family as ""perverse as it is offensive"" The inquiry heard that none of the information gathered about the family would have helped prevent public disorder - which was the supposed aim of the SDS. ""The undercover policing of the Lawrences occurred at times of the utmost sensitivity, while resources should have been focused on finding Stephen's killers, and during Macpherson,"" Mr Odogwu said. ""An intrusion in such highly sensitive periods requires a compelling case, and there is none."" Mr Lawrence said in a statement to the inquiry: ""The implication, that we were somehow the ones to watch, was as perverse as it was offensive. ""It was as though our grief was treated as a threat, and our home as a site of suspicion, something I will never accept or forgive.""

The travelling England supporters targeted Tuchel with numerous songs throughout the game after the German manager criticised fans after last week's win over Wales. The England boss had said he felt underwhelmed by the home support at Wembley during Thursday's 3-0 friendly win, comments that prompted a vocal response from England fans who made the trip to Riga. And speaking after the 5-0 win in the Latvian capital that booked England's place at the World Cup next summer, Tuchel said: ""I got a bit of stick today in the first half, so fair enough. I take it in good humour, with a good sense of humour. I accept it. ""They had a reason today from my last comments and I guess that's fair enough. ""I got a bit of stick and I found it quite creative. It made me smile and this is how it has to be. It's British humour and I surely can take it. No harm done."" On the impact of England's fans between now and the World Cup, the England boss added: ""It's so important. They are here and I said the support in Serbia was brilliant. The support today was brilliant and we are very sure the support in America will be absolutely brilliant. We need it. ""It makes such a difference if you go out as a player or as a coach and you see the fans behind the team and singing. This is also part of what we do.

As he stood at the headstone in St Kentigern's cemetery, where his father, mother and three other siblings already lay, he took a moment to remember Anne. Her final weeks had been ""haunted"" by an unexplained mix-up with the ashes of their mother, Patricia, who died in April 2023. Several months after Patricia's death, at the age of 100, it emerged the family had been given the wrong urn by funeral directors who are now the focus of a major police investigation. Five members of Brian's family lie in a plot at St Kentigern's cemetery in Glasgow Brian and Anne discovered the error just days before they planned to return to Scotland to scatter their mother's ashes. ""We had them for five months, then I found out it wasn't my mum, it was a total stranger,"" said Brian. ""I'd been kissing this total stranger goodnight every night and obviously it's affected my mental health."" The siblings were informed of the error when they contacted Clydebank Crematorium after questioning the lack of paperwork they had received with the urn from the former A Milne Funeral Directors. Brian said: ""Anne called Clydebank Crematorium and we were told [my mum's] ashes were never collected and were still being held there almost a year after her death."" During this time, the family also learned that the bill for Patricia's cremation was still outstanding, despite the pensioner having purchased a funeral plan at the firm's Dumbarton office. Anne had also taken out a funeral plan with the same company and found hers to be invalid too, prompting her to contact Police Scotland. Allison family Patricia Allison, who died aged 100 in 2023, and her daughter Anne, who died this year aged 67 In May 2024, one of the largest ongoing financial police investigations was launched into the practices of the former A Milne Independent Funeral Directors. Operation Koine is currently looking into more than 70 reports regarding practices at the firm. Last summer two women, aged 37 and 55, and a 56-year-old man were arrested in connection with the investigation and released pending further inquiries. Brian said the need for answers ""haunted"" his sister after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer last December. ""It affected Anne's health with the cancer because she was worried,"" he said. Brian added that the knowledge he would be the one left to pay for her funeral, despite having a plan, weighed on her. ""Even on her deathbed in the hospital, she said to me, 'I'm sorry you've been left with this'."" PA Media The A Milne Funeral Directors office in Springburn has been closed down Last month, police issued an appeal for anyone with concerns regarding the handling of cremated remains or pre-paid funeral plans with the former funeral directors - which also ran a premises in Springburn - to contact them. Det Supt Robert Bowie told BBC Scotland News officers were working through ""hundreds of lines of inquiry."" Since that appeal, police confirmed they had ""received more reports which are currently being assessed"". PA Media Det Supt Robert Bowie revealed police have received hundreds of inquiries from people who dealt with the funeral directors Brian Allison paid thousands of pounds of his own money for Anne's cremation after she died in August. Her final request was to be brought back to Scotland, but Brian also has a memorial for both his mother and sister at his home in Manchester. Brian said: ""I keep a little shelf in the living room with candles and everything around the both of them. ""So [some of] the ashes I didn't put down today, they'll come back to Manchester and they'll be kept there in the house so that I know I can speak to the two of them."" He added: ""I know it sounds strange when you're talking to a dead person but I talk to them every night. ""I say goodnight, I talk to them if I've had a bad day, tell them I love them."" Brian's sister Anne died in August, after he promised to continue their fight for answers Anne, who was 67 when she died, had moved from Dumbarton to live with Brian following the death of their mother. He said they had always been close growing up. Losing both his mother and sister in the last two years has put a strain on the 62-year-old's mental health. ""When I'm at work I leave the mental health side of me at home, but when I'm not working I don't leave the house now."" Brian's final promise to Anne was to continue to fight for answers on what went wrong with the plans she and her mother purchased. He said: ""I'll carry this on until my dying day if I have to, because I think it's all wrong. ""It's not just my mum and my sister. It's all these other innocent people. ""You can't just let it go.

70a6414f21f4,"I felt trapped, says victim of train sexual offence as reports rise",,"I felt trapped, says victim of train sexual offence as reports rise BBC Rhiannon was on the train on her way home from a day out with friends earlier this summer when she was sexually harassed by a group of men Reports of sexual assaults and harassment on trains have risen by more than a third over the past 10 years, according to data requested by a BBC investigation. There were 2,661 incidents reported across England, Scotland and Wales last year, where one in 10 were children - with some younger than 13. Rhiannon Williams said she was sexually harassed on a train earlier this year and recalled: ""You can't go anywhere, you can't escape. I had to sit there and put up with it."" British Transport Police has said the rise is a ""concern"" and will take every allegation ""seriously"" while the group that represents train companies added operators have a ""zero tolerance to sexual harassment"". Data gathered by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to the British Transport Police found a 37% increase in reports of sexual offences across England, Scotland and Wales since 2015. Warning: This story contains details some may find distressing. Rhiannon said she was sexually harassed on a train this summer by a group of drunken men while going home in west Wales after a day out with friends at the seaside resort of Tenby in Pembrokeshire. ""It was uncomfortable and scary,"" the 18-year-old told the BBC. Rhiannon's train ordeal was reported to police officers by a fellow passenger and officers are still investigating the incident from earlier this year ""It's a situation of feeling quite cornered. You're on a train, you can't go anywhere, you can't escape. It definitely made me feel trapped."" A witness reported the harassment to the British Transport Police and officers are still investigating the incident, which happened in August. ""It's due to the normalisation of these situations, the attitude that boys will be boys and it's something women should put up with,"" added Rhiannon, who is from Llanelli. ""It shouldn't be like that, these situations make women feel extremely intimidated and uncomfortable."" Sexual offences can include rape, sexual assault or sexual harassment. Police say harassment is anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or is inappropriate, such as staring, constant questioning or catcalling. British Transport Police say plain clothes officers patrol stations looking for people ""trying to position themselves closer to lone females"" Despite the rise, officers fear sexual assault and sexual harassment on trains and in stations is still underreported - and worry some do not report it to police at all. Like Maddie Waktare, who said she was sexually assaulted by a man sitting next to her while travelling on a train from London Waterloo. ""It was a busy train, but he was taking up more space than he needed to,"" said the 30-year-old. ""His body was encroaching onto me which made me feel uncomfortable. It was summer and I was wearing a dress and he ran his hand up the side of my thigh."" Maddie said she froze. ""He kept doing it,"" she added. Maddie Waktare Maddie Waktare was on a train from London going to visit family when she said she was sexually assaulted by a male passenger ""I stood up forcefully and glared at him. I was in shock and disbelief. I couldn't believe this had happened to me."" Now Maddie is angry for not reacting. ""I never thought I would be someone who would freeze,"" she said. ""It made me realise how normalised it is in society. The problem is you don't know what these people are capable of, it starts with something like this and then their crimes can get worse. I should have reported it."" Of those 22,100 reports of sexual offences on trains in the past 10 years, detectives could not identify a suspect in half of the cases. The UK government has said they have pledged £17m to improve British Transport Police's access to station CCTV to help ""ensure offenders are identified and brought to justice more quickly"". Footage of a train conductor being arrested on a station platform after sexually assaulting an 18-year-old female passenger has been released by the British Transport Police as part of the BBC investigation. Bodycam footage from police shows an officer arresting conductor Nicholas McMurray from a mainline train from London after he sexually assaulted an 18-year-old passenger Nicholas McMurray was jailed for seven years after being convicted for sexually assaulting a woman who cannot be named for legal reasons, on a mainline train between London Paddington and Swansea. She had been talking on her phone on a journey from Cardiff when Great Western Railway (GWR) train manager McMurray asked to check her train ticket, before adjusting her dress, and sexually assaulting her. The passenger reported the incident to British Transport Police when she arrived at Swansea Station and McMurray was arrested on the platform. Officers placed clear bags over his hands to preserve evidence before he was taken to the police station. The 38-year-old from Swansea was found guilty of sexual assault and assault by penetration at Swansea Crown Court earlier this year and put on the sex offenders register for life. British Transport Police CCTV footage from the GWR service between London and south Wales of train manager Nicholas McMurray before he was arrested GWR said McMurray was immediately removed from duty. ""He resigned with immediate effect during the disciplinary process, where the likely outcome was immediate dismissal,"" a spokesperson said. British Transport Police said McMurray had ""completely abused his position and took advantage of this young woman"". Sexual offences involving children under 18 have trebled on the trains in the past decade from 146 reports in 2015 to 443 in 2025. In total more than 2,900 reports were made over the past 10 years involving children. ""While any rise in crime figures is a concern, it's important to contextualise that this is down in part to an increase in intelligence-led operations involving plain clothes officers who are specially trained to identify offenders,"" said Det Ch Insp Nia Mellor of British Transport Police. Those undercover officers patrol stations looking for ""people hanging about not catching trains"". ""It's people moving up and down platforms trying to position themselves closer to lone females, or females that may be a bit more vulnerable because of intoxication,"" said Sgt Morgan Andrews. Officers also feel men should be more aware of how women may feel about being approached. It happened to Julia who was on a train with a friend from Bedford to London when she received unwanted attention from a group of men. ""They kept staring and speaking in a different language and it felt like they were planning something,"" said the 22-year old actress, originally from Switzerland but now living in London. Julia says unwanted attention from a group of men made her anxious She said at the end of the train journey the men started to follow them. ""We ran so they couldn't follow us to the tube or follow us home, you don't know what their intentions are,"" she said. ""I was really anxious. I was scared, I was scared for my friend Anyone that experiences or witnesses sexual assault or harassment on the rail network is advised to text the British Transport Police on 61016 with details of the incident, location and time. ""No woman or girl should be made to feel uncomfortable during their rail journey,"" said Det Ch Insp Mellor. ""Unacceptable behaviour on the network has serious consequences and will not be tolerated. ""We are relentless in our pursuit to hold these offenders to account and ensure the railway network is a safe place to be for everyone."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the UK's train operators, said every allegation will be ""taken seriously"". ""There's zero tolerance in terms of sexual harassment on our network,"" said their chief executive Jacqueline Starr. The UK government has said people should be able to use the rail network ""without fearing for their safety"". ""A rise in reports does not necessarily mean more incidents are occurring,"" added a government spokesperson. ""It may reflect that more victims now feel able to come forward because of increased awareness and messaging across the network.""

2576b03ce2ea,'It gave me my voice back': How group singing is helping new mums with postnatal depression,,"'It gave me my voice back': How group singing is helping new mums with postnatal depression The Melodies for Mums classes in south London started in 2017 and now take on more than 400 women a year Specially designed singing classes are clinically effective at treating mums with postnatal depression, a major three-year study has found. The authors say they could also be cost effective for the NHS at a time when mental health services are under pressure. At a children's centre in a housing estate in south London a group of 12 young mums sit in a circle on the floor as their babies cry, crawl and sleep on mats in front of them. But at this music class there are no bells or tambourines and no Wheels on the Bus or Baby Shark. Instead, the group work through a mix of lullabies, folk and gospel, switching from Spanish to Congolese to Swahili in rounds of four-part harmonies. The whole session, from the music selection, to the size of the group, to the set up of the room itself, has been carefully designed to treat the symptoms of postnatal depression. ""I can't stress enough how much this was a game changer for me,"" says Holly, 30, who started the course earlier this year after it was recommended by her care coordinator. She says she started feeling unwell in her pregnancy after ""my hormones, or something, went a bit wrong"". While those symptoms did start to improve after giving birth to her daughter Ettie, she still felt ""vulnerable and very anxious"". ""Being a new mum is one of the loneliest times, because you're sort of in this insular bubble,"" she says. ""And at the very first session here, I walked in and I was like, 'oh, this is my safe place'. Like, I'm safe here."" Holly is one of the 400 young mothers a year now attending specially designed singing classes across five London boroughs Postnatal depression is a common problem, affecting more than one in 10 women within a year of giving birth, according to the NHS . Symptoms are wide-ranging but can include persistent sadness or low mood, problems looking after yourself, insomnia and withdrawing from other people. Melodies for Mums started in 2017 as a free weekly class in Southwark, south London, based on earlier research which suggested group singing could reduce stress and anxiety. It's expanded quickly and now runs face-to-face sessions for 400 women a year in five London boroughs and online classes across the UK. ""We know that women experiencing symptoms of postnatal depression can struggle to connect with their peers,"" says Yvonne Farquharson, the founder of Breathe Arts Health Research, the non-profit organisation behind the idea. ""So through singing, we're getting them to really look at each other and make that kind of bond and social connection."" New mums often join the programme after it's suggested by their midwife, GP or local authority or find it through social media or word-of-mouth. There is a screening process to check they will benefit before starting the 10-week course. A 'long-lasting' impact In 2019 the sessions became part of a study funded by a £2.6m grant from the Wellcome Trust to research how local arts projects might improve physical and mental health at a larger scale. The results, published this week in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at almost 200 mums with postnatal depression over eight months. The women were split into two groups with one group assigned the singing course and the other offered more typical support like community play classes. All the mothers reported a reduction in their symptoms by week 10 but that improvement continued in the singing group for another six months beyond the end of the sessions. ""That's really important because it shows that the singing intervention is not only effective in the immediacy for depression, but it has a long-lasting impact,"" says Dr Rebecca Bind, a research associate at Kings College London and one of the study's lead authors. Women in the singing group also had a much lower dropout rate and were more likely to say they found it a good match for their needs and easy to use. The published paper didn't look specifically at why singing itself seemed to have a beneficial effect. But the researchers have their theories. ""I think part of it was women were in the presence of other mothers who were going through the same kind of experiences, even if they were not necessarily having to talk about it,"" says Dr Bind. ""And on top of that, the act of singing itself can have a very relaxing effect."" A second stage of the analysis has already taken saliva swabs from women to measure levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Early results suggest that mothers in the singing group saw a ""nice steady decline in those levels throughout the intervention period,"" according to Carmine Pariante, professor of biological psychiatry at Kings College London. The music classes also helped mums form a bond with their babies which continued after the end of the course as the songs and music were used at home. Jay, shown with her son Ezra, says a difficult birth had a ""huge impact"" on her mental health At the children's centre Jay, holding her young son Ezra, describes postnatal depression as ""feeling low when I know I should have been at the happiest point of my life"". ""Just being able to be with people who are also struggling, even though that's not the focus of the session [is important],"" she says. ""You're there, you're having a great time and singing, but you know that these people are also experiencing what you're experiencing."" Long NHS waiting lists The organisers stress the singing classes don't have to replace talking therapies or medication. But they could be either complimentary or a quicker, easier-to-access alternative for some women, at a time when there can be long waits for NHS mental health services. Some mothers can wait up to six months for assessment and up to a year for one-to-one treatment, according to a 2024 report by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance. The Kings College London study found the cost of the music course, at between £126 and £539 per mother and baby depending on how it's measured, was comparable to alternatives such as educational programmes and considerably lower than the cost of group therapy or home visits. Yvonne Farquharson at Breathe says the arts organisation has now piloted its first  singing sessions aimed at young dads. And it has also been commissioned by the World Health Organization to train teams to roll out the classes in Denmark, Italy, Romania and other countries. At the children's centre in south London the group talk not only about the friendships they have made, but also about the skills they've picked up over the 10 weeks. ""I have two very small children so things can get very stressful at home,"" says Stella while holding on tight to a wriggling baby Evie. ""I bring the singing back home with me so now I start humming when things get stressful, and I don't even think about it, it just happens and I can cope.""

35fd833ed068,Armenia captain 'lost his head' - Azaz on red card,,"The nervy win in Dublin moves the Republic of Ireland up to third in Group F, a point behind Hungary, who boosted their chances of securing a play-off place with a dramatic late draw against Portugal. The group is delicately poised with two games remaining. If Hungary beat Armenia in their next game, the Republic of Ireland must earn at least a point to take the battle for second place into their trip to Budapest on 16 November. The Republic of Ireland's chances have twice been hit by late goals during this window, having conceded a 91st-minute Ruben Neves goal in Saturday's 1-0 loss to Portugal in Lisbon. However, Azaz hopes the Irish players can build on that performance and Tuesday's crucial win in their quest to upset Cristiano Ronaldo and co in Dublin on 13 November. ""We know it's going to be tough, but we'll take confidence from last week and this game and we'll be confident we can do something special,"" Azaz added. ""It's going to be a big occasion, we saw the last game we can compete and they're top players, but we have to be able to compete and no doubt we'll be right up for it.""

The Daily Mail zeros in on official figures which it says show unemployment in the UK is at a four-year high, and wage growth has slowed.

Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, said Brexit paperwork, certificates, staffing, and additional costs from suppliers in Great Britain have led to customers paying more, adding he ""doesn't want and doesn't like it"". It comes as the House of Lords' Northern Ireland Scrutiny Committee found the Windsor Framework is ""impossible to navigate"". The government said the framework was ""the only workable solution"" that safeguards Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market and EU single market, and ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland. The Windsor Framework is a Brexit deal for Northern Ireland that was formally adopted by the UK and EU. It is designed to make trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK easier. The report said the UK government must address the difficulties businesses are facing. Mr Lynas told BBC News NI that it was ""still difficult to figure out the whole Brexit Windsor Framework agreement"". ""The reality is we do pay more, there is more paperwork, there are more health certificates, lots of checks, different things. ""Our stock holding is up half a million pounds because of it and I would say that the cost of goods is an extra 1% to 3% versus what you would pay in the mainland."" He said he has been working through the ""different iterations"" of protocols for nearly five years. Mr Lynas said the additional cost that suppliers, particularly in Great Britain, put on businesses had passed through to the customer. He said it had been a tough 12 months, which included the budget in October 2024 and national insurance changes. What did the Windsor Framework report say? Brexit paperwork, certificates, staffing, and additional costs from suppliers in Great Britain have led to the rising costs of goods The Northern Ireland Scrutiny Committee found the arrangements under the Windsor Framework are ""overwhelmingly complex and impossible for stakeholders to navigate"". Chair of the committee, Lord Carlile, told BBC News NI the Trader Support Service (TSS) must be redesigned. The TSS was set up in 2020 to help businesses deal with new customs processes. Lord Carlile said it should be ""simplified"" and supervised by the Cabinet Office. ""It should ensure that there is a one-stop shop to which businesses and social enterprises in Northern Ireland can go, and indeed social enterprises and businesses elsewhere trading with Northern Ireland, so that they can obtain speedy answers to avoid the complexities,"" he added. Lord Carlile said the committee was keen to see the introduction of a hotline relating to EU laws applying in Northern Ireland, so people can access information easily. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) has been approached for a response. Mr Lynas said it had been a tough 12 months following the budget in October 2024 and national insurance changes Mr Lynas said if you are an all-island business, the system of red lanes - set up for goods at Northern Ireland ports as a result of the Windsor Framework - does not work. ""The green lanes work brilliantly if you're a retail business in Northern Ireland - if you're bringing goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland it's been a big improvement,"" he said. ""But the reality is if you're an all-Ireland business in any shape or form [and have to use the red lanes] then it doesn't work."" Talks between the UK and EU are resuming this autumn. Mr Lynas said: ""I think we need to have ambition in these next sets of talks to say, how can we eradicate that? How do we use technology? How do we use AI? ""How do we build on the trust that is there and say, let's actually make this work for the long term? And so we have an agreement for the next five to 10 years."" A government spokesperson said the Windsor Framework is ""the only workable solution for Northern Ireland, safeguarding Northern Ireland's place in the UK Internal Market and the EU Single Market, and ensuring no hard border on the island of Ireland"". They said the government regularly engages with businesses and people in Northern Ireland ""as we work to deliver greater prosperity and security"". ""We will now consider the committee's findings and respond in due course."" What are the red and green lanes? Red lanes and green lanes were set up as a result of the Windsor Framework to ease trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

7a8eb367bbb3,Government under pressure to release China spy case evidence,,"Government under pressure to release China spy case evidence Iain Watson Political correspondent and Chris Mason Political editor AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for China The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are demanding the Labour government publish the evidence it submitted in the now-collapsed case against two people accused of spying for China. It follows another public intervention from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which has made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put their evidence in the public domain. On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them to do so would be ""inappropriate"". Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Both men deny the allegations. The director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. This row within a row relates to the three witness statements submitted by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins, on whether China had been regarded as a threat at the time of the alleged offences under the previous Conservative government. The CPS has now said: ""The statements were provided to us for the purpose of criminal proceedings which are now over. ""The material contained in them is not ours, and it is a matter for the government, independently of the CPS, to consider whether or not to make that material public."" Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told the BBC: ""The government should now urgently release Matt Collins's witness statements and the correspondence around them in the interests of full transparency. ""Since this evidence would have been cross-examined in court, it cannot be secret. ""Otherwise, there will be legitimate questions about what exactly the government is hiding."" Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Calum Miller also called on Labour to release the full witness statements. ""If ministers have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear,"" Miller said. ""Failure to come clean will just confirm people's suspicions of a cover-up and that ministers are more worried about cosying up to China than protecting our national security."" On Sunday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to the prime minister asking him to address ""unanswered"" questions about the collapsed case. In her letter , Badenoch accused Sir Keir Starmer, or his ministers, of being ""too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security"", claiming the government had sought to ""appease China"". Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this year There is every possibility Sir Keir will for the first time face sustained public scrutiny on the case on Wednesday, when he appears at the first Prime Minister's Question time for several weeks, after the parliamentary recess for party conferences. The Labour leader previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China, in which the country was called an ""epoch-defining challenge"", and his government has maintained it is ""frustrated"" the trial collapsed. The Tories have asked the CPS if it would be able to restart prosecutions against the two men, if new evidence is brought forward by the government declaring China a threat to national security. But there is an exceptionally high bar to prosecuting someone for a second time after an acquittal in court - and it is not possible to do so for people charged under the Official Secrets Act. That protection against what is known as ""double jeopardy"" is a basic legal principle that has existed for 800 years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql9v6x4wpzo,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a266/live/5582c670-a95a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-15T02:00:00.699000+00:00,e3c0606a97d0f53ed36929b4b5a80c4dffdf12c3

The Red Cross retrieved the remains in coffins and handed them over to the Israeli military late on Tuesday night. The transfer came after Israel warned it would restrict aid into Gaza until Hamas returned the bodies of all 28 deceased hostages. The Palestinian armed group handed back 20 living and four deceased hostages on Monday. The remains of 45 deceased Palestinians who had been held in Israel were returned to Gaza on Tuesday, the Red Cross said in a statement. The first four deceased hostages released by Hamas on Monday have been identified by Israel as Daniel Peretz, 22; Yossi Sharabi, 53; Guy Illouz, 26 and Bipin Joshi, 23, a Nepalese national . The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) office said the identification process for the latest four hostages was underway. US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted, envisaged the handover of all 48 hostages would be completed by noon on Monday. While all living hostages were returned, pressure is growing on Hamas and the Israeli government over the remains of 20 hostages which Hamas has not yet repatriated. Palestinians are increasingly worried that a delay in Hamas returning the bodies could bring uncertainty to the future of the ceasefire. Reuters Red Cross vehicles transport the bodies of deceased hostages who had been held in Gaza In a statement on Tuesday, the IDF said: ""Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to proper burial."" Israel's defence minister has warned the Palestinian armed group that ""any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly"". Israeli officials said they had decided to restrict aid and delay plans to open the Rafah border crossing with Egypt because Hamas had violated the ceasefire deal by failing to turn over bodies of hostages. Hamas says it has had difficulty locating the dead hostages' remains. Watch: 'I felt immense happiness and joy', Israelis react to hostage release A copy of the ceasefire agreement, published by Israeli media last week, appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions might not be able to locate all of the bodies within the original timeframe. An Israeli official has suggested that an international task force will start work to locate the remains of anyone who was not returned. ""A big burden has been lifted, but the job is NOT DONE. THE DEAD HAVE NOT BEEN RETURNED, AS PROMISED! Phase two begins right NOW!!!"" Trump said on X. Many Palestinians have told the BBC they are worried the delay in Hamas' return of all bodies of Israeli hostages and the subsequent violence could risk the ceasefire and derail the start of the second phase of negotiations. Tayseer Abed, a well-known Gaza writer who has chronicled the war from his tent in Khan Younis, described the standoff as ""a dangerous test for the ceasefire"", warning that if the delay continued and Israel refused to move to the next phase, ""the corpses issue could become the fuse that ignites a new round of conflict"". Almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released as part of the 20-point peace plan, touted by the US president as the end of the two-year war. The first phase of Trump's plan saw the ceasefire come into effect at 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on 10 October. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he remained hopeful for a peaceful next phase in the talks between Israel and Hamas. But he said Trump's conditions were ""very clear"" that Hamas must demilitarise or ""all hell breaks loose"". ""First, Hamas has to give up its arms,"" Netanyahu said. ""And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza. That's demilitarisation."" Watch: Netanyahu responds to Trump comment that he’s not ""the easiest"" to work with Trump also added pressure on Hamas to give up arms. ""They're going to disarm, because they said they would disarm. And if they don't disarm, we will disarm them,"" the US president said. While the ceasefire has largely held, Palestinian Civil Defence told the BBC that seven people were killed by Israeli forces on Tuesday in two separate incidents - in eastern Gaza and to the east of Khan Younis. An Israeli drone strike in Gaza's eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood killed five people, says Wafa news agency, which quoted a medical source saying ""Israeli drones fired at residents inspecting their homes"". The Israeli military said it fired after people crossed the yellow line, where its troops have withdrawn to under Trump's ceasefire plan. Meanwhile, Hamas fighters demonstrated they were reasserting control in Gaza, with reports of masked gunmen executing eight Palestinians in public triggering fear and outrage among residents. While Hamas maintains that its fighters are working to ""restore security"" and ""eliminate lawlessness,"" many fear the group is using the chaos to settle scores with rivals and silence critics. Reuters Red Cross vehicles escort a truck transporting the bodies of Palestinians who had been held in Israel during the war Trump signed the declaration on Monday , alongside the leaders of Egypt and Qatar - the main mediators - and Turkey, which played a significant role in the latter stages of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were among more than 20 world leaders attending - including many from Muslim and Arab countries. Netanyahu and Hamas did not take part. The plan would see Gaza initially governed by a transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats overseen by the ""Board of Peace"", before power is eventually transferred to the Palestinian Authority once it has undergone reforms. But difficult negotiations will be needed in order to move forward with the latter phases of the plan. Among the points of contention are the extent and timeline of Israeli troop withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas, and the future governance of the Gaza Strip. Hamas has previously said it will not disarm unless a Palestinian state was established - and has rejected the idea of foreign governance in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 67,869 people have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced60125zyqo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/03e4/live/8db4d510-a97d-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,2025-10-15T02:15:38.185000+00:00,0e338f9bcb45c28360260225ed57299f36b35e6a

Sixteen bodies have been recovered but were burned beyond recognition, the fire service said. Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing. The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said. Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years. Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) yesterday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said. Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned. Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died ""instantly"" after inhaling ""highly toxic gas"". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters. An investigation on whether the warehouse was operating legally is also ongoing, he added. Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. ""When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her....I just want my daughter back,"" he told Reuters news agency. Getty Images Grief-stricken relatives hold on to photographs of their loved ones still missing after a fire blazed through a garment factory in Bangladesh In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found. In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo OpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to ""treat adult users like adults"",  says its boss Sam Altman. In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way  - ""but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing"". The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers. It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions. OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment following Mr Altman's post. Changes announced by the company come after it was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life. The lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death. The Californian couple criticised the company's parental controls - which it said were designed to promote healthier use of its chatbot - saying they did not go far enough. The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts. Altman said that OpenAI previously made ChatGPT ""pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues"". ""We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,"" Mr Altman said. He said the company has now been able to mitigate the serious mental health risks and have new tools allowing it to ""safely relax the restrictions in most cases"". ""In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,"" he said. Critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels. ""How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?"" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. ""Open AI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs."" Ms Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users. ""We don't even know if their age gating is going to work,""  she said. In April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica. OpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content. A survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI. On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour. Newsom said it was ""imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems"" in a message that accompanied his veto. At the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children. In the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would classify AI chatbots as products. The law would allow users to file liability claims against chatbot developers. Mr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies. OpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable. Tulane University business professor Rob Lalka, who authored the recent book The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share. ""No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,"" Lalka told the BBC. ""They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd2qv58yl5o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/55e3/live/ab2ee790-a949-11f0-9ed6-59ec7d3b0c12.jpg,2025-10-14T23:19:53.401000+00:00,218e9d2bacfd75fbdedbd36b991c1b727496936a
d8daddb20503,Bitcoin worth $14bn seized in US-UK crackdown on alleged scammers,,"Bitcoin worth $14bn seized in US-UK crackdown on alleged scammers Lauren Turner and Osmond Chia Reuters The US government has seized more than $14bn (£10.5bn) in bitcoin and charged the founder of a Cambodian business empire, Prince Group, with allegedly masterminding a massive cryptocurrency scam. UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi was charged on Tuesday in New York for allegedly engaging in a wire-fraud conspiracy and running a money laundering scheme. Mr Chen's businesses were also sanctioned by the US and the UK as part of a joint operation. The UK government says it has frozen assets owned by his network, including 19 properties in London - one of which is worth nearly £100m ($133m). The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment. US prosecutors say it is one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin, with approximately 127,271 bitcoin being held by US government. Mr Chen, who remains at large, is accused of being the mastermind behind a ""sprawling cyber-fraud empire"" operating under his multi-national company, the Prince Group, said the US Department of Justice (DOJ) . The Cambodia-based group's website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. But the DOJ alleges that it runs one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations. Unwitting victims were contacted online and convinced to transfer cryptocurrency based on false promises that the funds would be invested and generate profits, the DOJ said. Prosecutors alleged that the company, under Mr Chen's direction, built and operated at least ten scam compounds throughout Cambodia, according to court documents seen by the BBC. Mr Chen was accused of managing the compounds that were specially designed to reach as many victims as possible, said prosecutors. His accomplices allegedly procured millions of mobile phone numbers and set up ""phone farms"" to conduct call centre scams, according to the court documents , dated 8 October. Two of these facilities had 1,250 mobile phones that controlled around 76,000 social media accounts for scams, the documents said. Prosecutors said Prince Group documents included tips on building rapport with victims, advising workers not to use profile photos of women who were ""too beautiful"" so that the accounts would look more genuine. US District Court EDNY Court documents contained images of ""phone farms"" allegedly used to conduct  scams Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A Eisenberg described the Prince Group as a ""criminal enterprise built on human suffering"". It also trafficked workers, who were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out scams online, targeting thousands of victims worldwide, he said. Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly used the criminal proceeds for luxury travel and entertainment, said the DOJ. They also made ""extravagant"" purchases like watches, private jets and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting purchases from a New York City auction house, the department said. If convicted, Mr Chen faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in jail. In Britain, Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly incorporated businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in UK property. His network's assets include a £100m office building on central London, a £12m mansion in North London and seventeen flats in the city, said the UK foreign office on Tuesday . Being sanctioned, as part of a joint operation with US authorities, means he is now locked out of the UK's financial system. The Prince Group has also been sanctioned in the US and labelled as a criminal organisation. They were ""ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money"", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. Cooper said: ""Together with our US allies, we are taking decisive action to combat the growing transnational threat posed by this network - upholding human rights, protecting British nationals and keeping dirty money off our streets."" The foreign office said Mr Chen and the Prince Group built casinos and compounds used as scam centres and laundered the proceeds. Four businesses linked to the alleged scams - The Prince Group, Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World and Byex Exchange -  have also been sanctioned, said the foreign office. Two scam centres allegedly run by Jin Bei Group and Golden Fortune Resorts were named earlier this year in an Amnesty International report on the use of forced labour and torture in Cambodian scam centres. People working in scam centres are often foreign nationals lured by the promise of a legitimate job, and then forced to carry out scams under threat of torture, the foreign office said. These scammers operate on an ""industrial scale"", including in the UK, using tricks like fake romantic relationships to lure victims into being scammed, said the foreign office. Fraud Minister Lord Hanson said: ""Fraudsters prey on the most vulnerable by stealing life savings, ruining trust, and devastating lives. We will not tolerate this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jw436n0yo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4f66/live/85395ba0-a972-11f0-81f4-2fecc5290ee1.jpg,2025-10-15T03:51:04.395000+00:00,b6dce77ce710dae360c89edb3ea706f46e95e0b9
c19c2b55a541,Trump says US will not 'waste our time' helping Argentina if Milei loses,,"President Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway legislative elections this month in the South American nation. Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not ""waste our time"" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail. Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to ""prosperity"". Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda. As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud. ""The election is coming up very soon,"" he said. ""It's a very big election."" Trump added: ""Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this. ""And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election."" A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027. But Trump said if ""a socialist wins"" then the US would feel ""a lot differently"" about supporting the South American nation. ""If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,"" Trump said. For his part, Milei blamed Argentina's economic woes on his political adversaries. ""This liquidity problem that Argentina has is a result of the political attacks we have suffered from our opponents,"" he told Trump. Trump's backing for his libertarian ally, who took office in December 2023, is no secret. But his explicit linking of a recently announced $20bn currency swap between the US and Argentina to Milei's electoral prospects is notable for an American president who has previously railed against foreign interference in elections. In recent provincial elections in Buenos Aires, Milei's La Libertad Avanza coalition (Freedom Advances) performed worse than expected, spooking markets as they watch for any sign his economic programme's days might be numbered. His party has recently been rocked by several corruption scandals. If Milei's party loses seats, or fails to gain more, in this month's midterms – that could affect his government's ability to pass further reforms. Several key vetoes he has tried to make have already been overturned by Congress, where he doesn't have a majority. But will US support actually make a difference? Argentine stocks fell after Tuesday's news conference. This intervention, which was supposed to stabilise the economy in Argentina, now seemed to hinge on Milei securing more political support. And it seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances. This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency – the peso, which has been losing value for years. As a means to control inflation, Milei had been stopping the peso from devaluing too drastically by keeping it propped up with the country's reserves. The problem with that is that it drained reserves ahead of $20bn of debt due next year. That led to fears, including among investors, that the country was heading for a financial crisis if it defaulted on its debts again. Some thought that to avert this Milei might have to let the currency devalue drastically – which would lead to a spike in prices as people's money would suddenly be worth less. Many economists told me they thought this would be ""political suicide"". So, perhaps the US intervention helps avoid that political disaster. But is this really going to cut through to ordinary voters? Opinion polls suggest that some Argentines are tiring of Milei's sharp austerity measures. His supporters hail them for bringing down inflation and cutting the deficit. But they've come at a social cost – with large cuts to pensions, education, health, infrastructure, and transport and utilities subsidies among other things.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n82gd7pvo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a3df/live/4a937bf0-a951-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-14T23:17:50.835000+00:00,f422f7dde50076b37ce78b303c855e4c97573c5c
0b9ecf5b31c2,Spain's radically different approach to African migration,,"Spain's radically different approach to African migration Paul Melly West Africa analyst AFP via Getty Images Spain is kicking against the prevailing political mood among Western nations when it comes to migration and policies regarding the African continent. At a time when the US, the UK, France and Germany are all cutting back their development aid budgets, Madrid remains committed to continued expansion, albeit from a lower starting point. This week, the Spanish capital has been hosting an African Union-backed ""world conference on people of African descent"". AfroMadrid2025 will discuss restorative justice and the creation of a new development fund. It is just the latest sign of how Spain's socialist-led government is seeking to deepen and diversify its engagement with the continent and near neighbour that lies just a few kilometres to the south, across the Straits of Gibraltar. In July Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares launched a new advisory council of prominent intellectual, diplomatic and cultural figures, more than half of them African, to monitor the delivery of the detailed Spain-Africa strategy that his government published at the end of last year. New embassies south of the Sahara, and partnerships in business and education are planned. The contrast between Spain's approach and that of others in the West is not just in spending but in tone and mindset – and nowhere more so than in dealing with migration. Similar to elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is looking for ways to contain the influx of irregular arrivals. Like other centre-left and centre-right leaders, he finds himself facing an electoral challenge from the radical right, largely driven by some voters' concern over migration, with the hardline Vox party well established in parliament and routinely ranking third in opinion polls. In July, extra security forces had to be deployed against racist thugs roaming the streets of Torre Pacheco, in Murcia region – where many Africans work in the booming horticultural sector – after three Moroccans were accused of beating a pensioner. While the opposition conservative People's Party remains favourable to some immigration, but for cultural reasons wants to prioritise Latin Americans rather than Africans, Vox has been more radical. Responding to the Murcia incident Vox called for a crackdown on immigrants taking up less skilled jobs. The message largely targeted Africans working in fruit and vegetable production, now so crucial to the southern Spanish economy. But for the government the migration presents challenges that are as much practical as political. AFP via Getty Images Thousands try to make the crossing to the Canary Islands on packed wooden boats More than 45,000 people made the perilous sea crossing from Africa's west coast to the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands last year. Estimates of those who died while making the attempt range between 1,400 and a staggering 10,460. Others make the shorter journey across the Gibraltar Straits or the Mediterranean to land on Andalusian beaches or try to scramble over the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclave towns on the North African coast. The Spanish administration has to accommodate new arrivals, process their claims and manage their absorption into wider society, whether temporary or more long-lasting. However, in language markedly different from the hostile messaging that emanates from many European capitals, the Sanchez government openly acknowledges the hard economic realities on the ground in West Africa that push people to risk their lives in the effort to reach Europe. And it is trying to move beyond simply saying ""no"" to new arrivals. Instead, it is developing creative alternatives, with a promise to foster movements of people that are safe, orderly and regular and ""mutually beneficial"". On his trip to Mauritania last year, Sanchez stressed the contribution that migrants make to the Spanish economy. ""For us, the migratory phenomenon is not only a question of moral principles, solidarity and dignity, but also one of rationality,"" the prime minister said. The Spanish government funds training schemes for unemployed youth in countries such as Senegal, especially for irregular migrants who have been sent back, to help them develop viable new livelihoods back home. And it has expanded a ""circular migration"" programme that gives West Africans short-term visas to come to Spain for limited periods of seasonal work, mainly in agriculture, and then return. These issues were at the heart of the agenda when Sanchez visited Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania in August last year. A circular migration agreement with the former had been in place since 2021, but similar accords with the Mauritanian and Gambian governments have since followed. The underlying case for this singular approach was set out in detail in the foreign ministry's Spain-Africa strategy. This argued that Europe and Africa ""form part of the same geopolitical space"". But the management of migration is only one motive for the Spanish decision to place emphasis on building relations with Africa – and indeed support a much broader related social-cultural agenda. AFP via Getty Images Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) met Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (L) in Madrid last year The fundamental premise underlying Madrid's outreach is that Spain, as the European country closest to the continent, has an essential self interest in Africa's progress towards inclusive and sustainable development, and peace and security. That basic rationale might seem obvious. Yet of course history had taken Spain down a quite different path. Other than a few Maghreb footholds and a small tropical outpost – today's independent Equatorial Guinea – its colonial expansion in the 16th and 17th Centuries had mainly been directed across the Atlantic. And over recent decades, European affairs and the Middle East had tended to dominate Madrid's foreign policy priorities, while the main beneficiaries of its development support were the countries of its vast former empire in Central and South America. However, the past few years have seen the Sanchez government preside over a fundamental broadening of outlook. Barely had Albares been installed as foreign minister in July 2021 than he launched a restructuring of his department, in part to strengthen its engagement not only with Latin America but also with the Sahel and North Africa. Confirmation of the wider geographical emphasis came with a development co-operation plan for 2024-27, which for the first time, designated West Africa, including the Sahel, as one of three regions prioritised for assistance, alongside Central and South America. Spain's Africa strategy lays heavy emphasis not just on economic sectors such as infrastructure, digitalisation and energy transition but also particularly on education and youth employment. The cultural dimension includes not only promotion of the Spanish language, with an expanded presence of the Cervantes Institute, but also programmes to help the mobility of academic teachers and researchers. Security co-operation, action on climate change, women's empowerment and an expanded diplomatic presence are unsurprising components in today's environment. However, the strategy also lays very public stress it places on supporting democratic ideas, the African Union and, in particular, the West African regional organisation Ecowas. This will be welcome public encouragement for the latter, which is currently under severe pressure after seeing its 50th anniversary year marred by the walk-out of the Sahelian states – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – whose ruling military juntas have refused to comply with its protocol on democracy and good governance. Meanwhile, in a message targeted as much at Madrid's domestic audience as its sub-Saharan partners, the foreign ministry said ""supporting the African diaspora and the fight against racism and xenophobia are also key priorities"". Fine words of course are only a first step. But in today's sour international climate such language really does stand out.

4261a4ddb4a3,The Indian woman who stood up to moral policing - and won a pageant,,"The Indian woman who stood up to moral policing - and won a pageant Geeta Pandey BBC News, Delhi Muskan Sharma Muskan Sharma has dedicated her crown to her mother Muskan Sharma stood up to men who tried to bully her over her clothes - and went on to win hearts and a beauty pageant. The 23-year-old, who was crowned Miss Rishikesh 2025 last week in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the BBC that even though it was a small local pageant, ""it made me feel like Miss Universe"". Sharma's win has made headlines in India as it came after a viral video that showed her spiritedly arguing with a man who barged into their rehearsals just a day before the 4 October contest. Sharma, who ""wanted to be a model and participate in a pageant since I was in school"", said the intruders came in just as they broke for lunch. ""We were sitting around, chilling, having a laugh when they walked in,"" she said. The footage showed Raghavendra Bhatnagar, district head of a Hindu group called Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Sangathan, objecting to skirts and western dresses Sharma and other contestants were wearing. ""Modelling is over, go back home,"" Bhatnagar is heard telling them. ""This is against Uttarakhand's culture."" Sharma refuses to back down. ""Why don't you shut the shops which sell them [Western clothes]?"" She then tells him that he should expend his energies on things that are worse than women's clothing - social evils such as drinking and smoking. ""There's a shop right outside that sells cigarettes and alcohol. Why don't you shut that down? First stop those things and I will stop wearing these clothes,"" she says. The man snaps at her saying ""don't tell me what to do"". Likewise, she retorts. ""If you have the right to choose, then so do we. Our opinion matters as much as yours,"" she says. As the argument continues, Sharma is joined by some of the other contestants and organisers and Bhatnagar and his group, who threatened to stop the show, are finally escorted out by the hotel manager. Muskan Sharma The Miss Rishikesh contestants were heckled by men for their clothes during rehearsals Sharma says her reaction to Bhatnagar was ""spontaneous"". ""I could see my dreams shattering in front of me. The only question in my mind at the time was will the pageant go on? Will I be able to walk the ramp? Or will all my hard work go waste?"" she says. The next day, the event went on as planned and Sharma won the crown. ""For three seconds after I heard my name announced, I was shocked,"" she said. ""But then I was happy that I stood up for myself and that I won. It felt like a double victory. It was a small pageant in a small place but it made me feel like Miss Universe,"" she said. Sharma says heckling of women for their clothing is unheard of in Rishikesh, a city in the Himalayan foothills on the banks of Ganges river. It's known for its ashrams and meditation and yoga retreats and is considered a holy Hindu site that draws in large numbers of tourists and pilgrims. The city is also sought out by fans of Beatles because the Fab Four had spent weeks at an ashram there in 1968. ""You see tourists dressed in western clothing here all the time and no-one bats an eyelid,"" she adds. Globally, beauty pageants have been criticised for objectifying women and reinforcing gender stereotypes. But these contests have been hugely popular in India since 1994 - the year when Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown and Aishwarya Rai brought home the Miss World trophy. Both went on to become top Bollywood actresses and have inspired generations of young women since then to follow in their path. Similar successes in later years of Priyanka Chopra, Diana Hayden and Lara Dutta have only reinforced the belief that beauty pageants can be a ticket to success, especially for young women in small-town India. Sharma says her parents have always been very supportive of her decision to participate in the pageant. In the viral video, she's even heard asking Bhatnagar: ""Who are you to comment on my clothing if my parents allow me to to wear them?"" Muskan Sharma The pageant took place as planned But the backlash to Western clothing in India is not new where what women wear routinely becomes a subject of debates. In a deeply patriarchal society, many link western clothing, especially jeans, to the "" moral degradation "" of young people. Schools and colleges set dress codes for female students and sometimes village elders bar an entire community of girls from wearing jeans. The BBC has reported a number of cases where girls and women have been singled out and humiliated for their clothes. A few years ago, we wrote about a 19-year-old student in Assam who turned up in shorts to take an exam and was forced to wrap a curtain around her legs after the teacher objected. In one extreme case , a teenager was allegedly murdered by her relatives for wearing jeans. Namita Bhandare in her column in The Hindustan Times newspaper points out that there is no objection to the Mr Rishikesh contest where participants are barely dressed. The objection to Sharma and other contestants' clothing, she writes, is ""barely a fig-leaf"". ""The issue is not clothes. The issue is freedom and aspiration. How dare these young women be on a stage that could springboard them to a larger global platform? How dare they cross lines of honour and shame that a patriarchal society has imposed on them?"" Bhandare writes that in India where there are not enough women MPs or judges, the pushback by young women from a small town is remarkable. Sharma says it's her mother who taught her to stand up for what's right. ""The crown is as much my mother's as it's mine. Without her I wouldn't be the person I am today."" Her story, she believes, will now encourage other women to stand up for themselves, for what is right. ""I'm saying that in the moment, I was scared and nervous too. But I also want to say that if you believe that you're right, then you can also fight."" ""For me,"" she says, ""the crown was always secondary. The more important thing was to encourage women to stand up against injustice, to speak up for what's right,"" I ask her what's the next step for her. ""I will go for Miss Uttarakhand next year and then Miss India. After that, I'll see where life takes me.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlzqzlnvvpo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/101e/live/3d6de010-a590-11f0-bbf9-f1d34ef91255.jpg,2025-10-14T23:10:21.097000+00:00,21ec540e09bd6e6fc635c2ba305b110543ca7519

A group of seven men are on trial at Newport Crown Court charged with rioting on 22 May 2023 following the deaths of Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, in an e-bike crash in Ely, after rumours spread that they were being followed by the police. Character references from Kyrees' mother, Belinda Sullivan, and Harvey's mother, Nadine Evans, were read to the jury in relation to Jaydan Baston. Ms Sullivan described the 21-year-old as ""polite"" and ""hard-working"" and a ""good friend for a long time"" to her son. The court has already heard how Mr Baston was a member of a football team called H&K Forever Young, set up in memory of the two teens, and Ms Sullivan said in her reference that Mr Baston played ""his heart out week in week out, showing dedication and commitment"". Ms Evans also described Mr Baston as ""well-mannered, polite and respectful"". On Tuesday, the jurors were told they would not need to give a verdict in the case of 37-year-old Michaela Gonzales, who has been absent repeatedly from court due to illness.

0f37c4f8f4f6,Red Tractor ad banned for misleading environmental claims,,"Red Tractor ad banned for misleading environmental claims Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Red Tractor The Red Tractor advert was last shown in 2023 but will now be banned for future use unless it is updated A TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided ""insufficient evidence"" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad. Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was ""greenwashing"" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards. In 2021, Red Tractor aired an advert in which it said: ""From field to store all our standards are met. When the Red Tractor's there, your food's farmed with care."" You can watch it below. Watch: the ad banned by the Advertising Standards Authority The environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will ""ensure a high degree of environmental protection"". The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020 , which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were ""not currently an indicator of good environmental performance"". After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint. It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad. It also ruled that as a result the advert was ""misleading"" and ""exaggerated"" the benefits of the scheme. River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act. ""What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,"" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. ""So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves."" She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution. In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff. BBC News/Tony Jolliffe Amy Fairman represents environmental charity River Action which campaigns for clean and healthy rivers But Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA ""fundamentally flawed"". Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made."" He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues. ""Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,"" said Mr Moseley. When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: ""Correct"". But many supermarkets do refer to the environmental benefits of Red Tractor farms. Natalie Smith, Tesco's head of agriculture said last month, on the 25-year anniversary of Red Tractor: ""Certification schemes play a key role in providing reassurance for customers, and over the past 25 years, Red Tractor has established itself as a mark of quality, standing for… environmental protection."" On Morrisons' website it states: ""100% of the fresh pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk and cheddar cheese we sell in our stores comes from farms certified by Red Tractor, or an approved equivalent scheme, giving customers assurance… environmental protection."" Both supermarkets were asked if they stood by the Red Tractor logo. Morrisons did not respond to comment and Tesco referred the BBC to their industry body the British Retail Consortium. The consortium said that ""retailers remain committed to working with Red Tractor"", but that the organisation themselves are owners of the scheme.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lmnvj3n5o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ad99/live/38b93b50-a8f6-11f0-a33c-d7bc21b91844.jpg,2025-10-15T02:40:44.248000+00:00,5e9696c7192481b6c90eddafd4276f94e67c167b

Colin Flatt, whose clubs included Leyton Orient and Cambridge United, was shuffled between 12 different settings in the final few months before he died after a fall at Basildon Hospital in September 2021. An investigation, commissioned by the NHS, found he was given unsafe medication, was injured while being restrained, placed in inappropriate environments and his human rights were breached. The NHS organisations concerned apologised or said they were working to improve standards of care. Mr Flatt died, aged 81, following a fall at Basildon Hospital in Essex. The independent report described how he had become agitated following a family visit and had stabbed himself in his abdomen with a pair of scissors. He ran from the ward and fell over the railings of a first-floor landing on to a glass table. He did not recover from his injuries. Getty Colin Flatt (middle of the seated row) in Leyton Orient's squad when they were in the old Second Division in 1965 Mr Flatt, who also played for Southend United, Romford, Barnet, and Wisbech Town, had been suffering from memory loss and was admitted to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford in May 2021 with a low heart rate. He was subsequently assessed by the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) mental health team and diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The report described how ""following several incidents of violence and aggression"" he was transferred to Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London, on 9 June and detained under the Mental Health Act. A Mental Health Tribunal determined that he could be discharged but he was unable to settle at home and he was accepted as a respite placement by a care home with support from a team from EPUT. He was then transferred to another care home because his needs could not be met, this time with support from the North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT). Mr Flatt absconded from the home and was returned by the police but it was then decided to send him to Basildon Hospital because of his heart problems, where he he then had the fall. The investigation, commissioned by NHS England, found a series of failings in relation to Mr Flatt's treatment and care: He was held within hospitals and care home settings without a legal framework ""in breach of his human rights"" A high-risk anti-psychotic drug was prescribed at Basildon Hospital despite his heart problems and the doses ""exceeded limits of various trust policies"" Inappropriate use of chemical and physical restraints by Broomfield and Basildon hospital staff, which also injured him His partner's views were not always taken into account despite her having legal power of attorney Mr Flatt was placed in unsuitable rooms at Broomfield including one where there was ""continuous hammering and drilling"" Early morning transfers at 01:00 and 02:00 ""which should have been avoided"" An initial review into his fall was ""significantly delayed and incomplete with an absence of analysis"" The report made 17 recommendations with the bulk focused on the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MSEFT), which runs Broomfield and Basildon hospitals. PA Colin Flatt's partner, Melanie Leahy said ""to see him deteriorate so rapidly under supposed professional care is something I will never recover from"" Mr Flatt's partner Melanie Leahy said he had been ""stripped of his dignity"". ""I watched a strong, capable man walk into hospital seeking help and, within just 19 weeks, he was gone,"" she said. ""The lack of proper care, the poor communication, the absence of oversight, and the dangerous overuse of medication"" had ""stripped Colin of his health, dignity, and life. ""He was a professional footballer, a sailor, and a businessman — proud, independent, and full of humour and kindness. ""To see him deteriorate so rapidly under supposed professional care is something I will never recover from."" An inquest into Mr Flatt's death is due to take place in August 2026. His case has already been heard by the Lampard Inquiry, which was set up to investigate historical failings within Essex's mental health services. Ms Leahy's 20-year-old son Matthew also died in 2012 while he was under the care of the same services. 'Learning and improvements' Christine Blanshard, chief medical officer for MSEFT, said: ""We offer our sincere condolences to Colin's family and want to reassure them that learning and improvements have been put in place since his death in 2021. ""We have already submitted a robust action plan which responds to the points made."" Paul Scott, chief executive EPUT, said: ""My thoughts are with Colin's family and friends and I am deeply sorry for failings in his care."" A spokesman for NELFT said: ""We extend our deepest condolences to Mr Flatt's family and loved ones. We hope that the investigation has helped answer important questions about the circumstances surrounding his death.""

d609e1c3d14a,Clarity needed on border poll process - Long,,"Clarity needed on border poll process - Long PA Media Naomi Long said certainty is needed around the border poll process Alliance Party leader Naomi Long has called for the Northern Ireland secretary to set out the criteria for when he would call a border poll. The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) says a referendum must be held if the secretary of state believes it is likely that a majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote for Irish unification. However, how that is measured has never been made clear. Now Long, who is also Stormont's justice minister, has said she believes the British government must give certainty about the process. ""I think it would be helpful for the secretary of state to set out what the conditions for a border poll would be,"" she told the BBC's Borderland podcast . ""What I think is toxic at the moment is by not setting out the conditions every single election becomes a kind of proxy for a border poll."" What does GFA say about a border poll? The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was a political deal designed to bring an end to 30 years of violent conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. It was signed on 10 April 1998 and approved by public votes in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It set up a new government for Northern Ireland, representing both nationalists and unionists. The agreement says that Northern Ireland is part of the UK and this can change only through a referendum. The secretary of state must hold a border poll if it appears likely that a majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote for Irish unification. There is no detail in the agreement on how the secretary of state should judge whether there is majority support - but they can decide to hold a border poll at any time, provided that there has not been another in the last seven years. There is also debate as to what form a border poll should take, for example whether the poll should be held on the general principle of unification or after specific proposals have been set out for how a united Ireland would be governed. The third episode of Borderland – UK or United Ireland? focuses on the political middle ground in Northern Ireland – voters who don't identify as only British or Irish. The Alliance Party's share of the vote has grown substantially over the past 20 years and political analysts believe their support could be crucial if a border poll was ever held. ""I don't think we will see a nationalist or unionist majority any time in the foreseeable future in the Assembly,"" said David McCann of Ulster University. ""My view has always been that this goes through one woman… and that is Naomi Long. ""It is whenever she and her party decide it is time to have this conversation."" Getty Images Referendum assessment Long said that she would prefer if the assessment on whether to hold a referendum was based on polling rather than electoral results. ""People's reasons for voting in different elections in different constituencies are influenced by so many things,"" she said. ""In the interim we do need to test the proposition. ""What it would cost? How it would work? What happens to your pension contributions? ""All those basic things that, to be honest, nobody really focused on when it came to Brexit."" Earlier this year, when she was a junior Northern Ireland minister, Fleur Anderson told the Agenda NI magazine that the decision would be based on opinion polls. However, the Labour MP is no longer a minister and at the time the Northern Ireland Office appeared to distance themselves from her comments insisting that ""the responsibility for a referendum sits solely with the secretary of state"".

Not least because he is now living near the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, where the cycling will be held. But his decision to quit had already been made and retrospective examination of what he said at the time shows a vagueness about his ambitions for that event. As a potential poster boy for the reimagined event - as a kid he sat rapt in the tribunes in 2014 and won medals at the next two Games - was it a wrench to walk away from the chance of a glorious career conclusion? ""It's been the elephant in the room,"" Carlin said of Glasgow 2026. ""People I've told have asked, 'what about Glasgow?' but it's less than a year away and I'd be doing myself and the jersey a disservice if I decided to try and put it round my back again when I'm just not in the shape to do it."" Carlin does not need that elusive gold medal or one more wave of adoration from a home crowd to validate his achievements. They are achievements that place him fourth in the list of all-time Scottish Olympic medal winners, behind only Duncan Scott, Sir Chris Hoy and Katherine Grainger. As he says, plenty of his competitors will leave the sport without ribbons around their neck and precious metal in their hands. Like him, they will have memories, experiences and friendships, and it is those - as much as the medals - that the Scot will cherish when he reflects. ""It's rare that someone steps away when they're still rubbing shoulders at the top,"" he adds. ""But you have to be able to give 100%. ""I can come away from this saying 'I gave everything I could, I gave my whole body to this sport, and I'm satisfied'. I couldn't do anything more. So I can't be upset. ""I started this journey when I was 14 years old and my mum and dad gave up time and money that we didn't have to let me chase that dream.

a2cd45d6754b,Reeves acknowledges she is looking at tax rises ahead of Budget,,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has acknowledged she is ""looking at tax and spending"", ahead of her autumn Budget next month. Reeves said she would ""always make sure the numbers add up"", in an interview with Sky news against a backdrop of slow economic growth and mounting government debt. The chancellor has previously hinted at tax rises, and economists have said they expect taxes to go up in the Budget if the chancellor wants to meet her self-imposed rules on borrowing. With this comment, the chancellor has also signalled that spending cuts could be a consideration. The Budget in November is the moment when the chancellor outlines the UK government's plans for the economy. Reeves has faced repeated questions about the prospect of tax rises in her Budget. Some analysts have estimated that the chancellor will have to increase taxes or cut spending to fill a hole in the public finances, estimated to be £20bn-£30bn. Reeves received the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) assessment of the economy on 3 October. Now the chancellor's brief comments make more explicit what has been assumed across Westminster for many months – that tax rises in the Budget are inevitable. It is likely that in the weeks before the Budget, as Reeves learns more about how much money she needs to raise and makes decisions about how to do it, she and other ministers will become more explicit still about the direction of travel. Speaking to the BBC, Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said he wouldn't speculate on what might be in the Budget. ""The chancellor makes all her decisions on Budget day on 26 November and sets out her package there,"" Murray said. ""Yes, a budget focuses on tax and spend and we'll set out how we're keeping a tight grip on public spending."" The additional suggestion of spending cuts by Reeves is intriguing - many Labour MPs believe that spending cuts in most areas would be politically unviable after the failed attempts at welfare cuts earlier this year, although the government could promise to cut spending in four or five years. Reeves told Sky News the effects of Brexit, austerity policies and former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget had damaged the UK economy. Sky News reported that when asked how she would deal with the country's economic challenges, Reeves said: ""Now, of course, we are undoing some of that damage by the deal that we did with the EU earlier this year on food and farming, goods moving between us and the continent, on energy and electricity trading, on an ambitious youth mobility scheme, but there is no doubting that the impact of Brexit is severe and long-lasting."" In her speech to Labour conference last month, Reeves said the government was facing difficult choices and promised she would not take risks with the public finances . The chancellor pledged to keep ""taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible"". Labour promised in its 2024 manifesto ahead of last year's general election not to increase taxes on ""working people"", saying the party would not ""increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT"". On Monday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year. But the IMF also predicted the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said needed to get a grip on public spending, rather than raise taxes again. He said: ""Be in no doubt, this tax doom loop is down to the Chancellor's economic mismanagement. ""Under Rachel Reeves we have seen inflation double, debt balloon, borrowing costs at a 27-year high, and taxes up - with more pain on the way in the autumn.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drpzxpkp3o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a9de/live/588597d0-a9aa-11f0-97ec-91b89bd10dfa.jpg,2025-10-15T10:26:58.165000+00:00,061e770fab4a741b8eb72cd2b493fceffe591081

Wednesday marks four years to the day since Sir David, the Conservative MP for Southend West, was stabbed to death by an Islamic State fanatic while holding a surgery in Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Sir David's daughter, Katie Amess, who wants a public inquiry into his death, told the BBC: ""We went back to Keir Starmer and he's just ignored us ever since, despite promising us that he would meet with us again if we weren't happy."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We understand that the Amess family are still looking for answers and we take this incredibly seriously."" Getty Images Sir David Amess died on 15 October 2021, after he was stabbed at a constituency surgery more than 20 times Sir David's killer, Ali Harbi Ali, who was 26 at the time, is in prison for life. His trial heard he became radicalised online by the war in Syria and by the group calling itself Islamic State. ""This was a murder that struck at the heart of our democracy,"" Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said. The Anderson Review into the government's de-radicalisation programme, known as Prevent, found this summer that ""in the case of Ali Harbi Ali, there was a string of failures"". Lord Anderson said this was down largely to ""human error"". Harbi Ali had been referred to Prevent by his school — Riddlesdown Collegiate in Croydon, south London — and he was part of the programme between 2014 and 2016. PA Media Katie Amess (centre), who met the prime minister in Downing Street in March, wants to meet with the government again The Amess family lawyers wrote to the home secretary, who was Yvette Cooper but is now Shabana Mahmood, in July outlining specific questions: Were any checks made with Harbi Ali's school in Croydon, south London,  before he was allowed to leave the Prevent programme? What did the security services know in the five years between Prevent and Sir David's murder? What social media checks were carried out? To access documentation and interview the individuals who dealt with Harbi Ali a decade ago To find out why Harbi Ali was assessed to be dropped from Prevent and who made that decision. They are now calling for a full public inquiry. ""There's grief, there's trauma, and there's also anger as to why nobody is helping us get these answers,"" Ms Amess said. ""I don't understand why the government isn't fully behind finding out why this happened. ""My dad was their colleague for nearly 40 years. He was a great friend."" 'Speculative' The Amess family has tried to get the inquest into Sir David's death reopened. The senior Essex coroner, Lincoln Brookes, found ""no evidential basis to consider this attack was possibly preventable so many years and imponderables later"". He added: ""It would be speculative to assume that national security services do, should or could, detect and track every Islamic State sympathiser."" In July 2024, Mr Brookes turned down their request to reopen the hearing. He concluded: ""The fact that the perpetrator's case was not handled as well as it should have been in Prevent does not of itself amount to any evidence that Sir David's death was possibly or probably preventable five years later had his case been handled better. ""One can only speculate."" Aaron Chown/PA People lined the streets of Southend for Sir David Amess's funeral in November 2021 A Home Office spokesperson said: ""While we do not think a public inquiry would unearth any information that has not already been assessed, we have confirmed that we will further scrutinise all the reviews that have taken place over the last few years. ""We very much hope this will help the family to get the answers they deserve."" The government has indicated ""a senior figure"" will be appointed to look at the reviews. The spokesperson added: ""In the years since this cowardly attack, there have been several reviews asking how this could have been avoided, and we have seen significant improvements to the Prevent programme as well as stronger protections for MPs.""

fb2ad7d2db4c,Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga dies in India aged 80,,"Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has died at the age of 80, family sources have told the BBC. Odinga died on Wednesday while receiving medical treatment at a hospital in India. He collapsed during a morning walk and was taken to Devamatha Hospital, which said he had suffered a cardiac arrest. It said he did not respond to resuscitation measures and was ""declared dead at 09:52"" local time (04:22 GMT). In recent weeks, there has been speculation about his health, although family members and political allies had dismissed reports suggesting he was critically ill. President William Ruto paid tribute to Odinga as a ""beacon of courage"" and ""father of our democracy"". He has also declared a seven-day period of mourning, in a live address to the nation. Kenyan politicians and world leaders have been sending their condolences, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described Odinga as a ""towering statesman and a cherished friend of India"". The Kenyan president had earlier visited Odinga's family home in Nairobi and expressed his condolences to his widow Ida Odinga and other family members. His supporters have been pouring onto the streets to mourn, especially in his political strongholds of western Kenya and parts of Nairobi. A political mobiliser and towering figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times. He rejected the results on each occasion, often saying that victory had been stolen from him. He was vindicated by Kenya's highest court after the 2017 elections, when it annulled Uhuru Kenyatta's victory and ordered fresh polls. However, he boycotted the rerun, demanding electoral reforms. Odinga later made up with Kenyatta, stunning the nation when the two shook hands in 2018 – ending months of tension. The disputed election of 2007, in which Odinga claimed he was cheated of victory by Mwai Kibaki, led to the biggest crisis in Kenya's history. Violence erupted around the country, resulting in 1,200 deaths and about 600,000  people were forced to flee their homes. To resolve the crisis, a power-sharing agreement was brokered by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, leading to the formation of a unity government in which Odinga became prime minister. He has often reconciled with the incumbent president after contentious elections. After his most recent defeat in 2022, he later joined President Ruto in a so-called broad-based government, which brought several of his allies into key positions. He defended the move as necessary for national unity, coming in the aftermath of watershed nationwide protests last year that culminated in the storming of parliament . Dozens of protesters were killed in confrontations with security officers. The Ruto administration backed Odinga's bid to become chairperson of the African Union Commission, in elections held earlier this year. Despite strong regional support, he lost to Djibouti's Mahmoud Ali Youssouf. Odinga inspired a passionate and loyal following throughout his political career, especially in western Kenya, where he was born. His supporters called him ""Baba"" (Father), ""Agwambo"" (Act of God), and ""Tinga"" (Tractor) - drawn from his party's symbol during the 1997 elections. He was widely regarded as a master strategist and mass mobiliser, often drawing huge crowds to his political rallies, and he had a deep ability to connect with ordinary people. He will be remembered for his unwavering fight for democratic freedoms and human rights. He was a former political prisoner, and holds the record for being Kenya's longest-serving detainee. His struggle against one-party dictatorship saw him detained twice (from 1982 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991) during the rule of Daniel arap Moi. He was initially imprisoned for trying to stage a coup in 1982, which propelled him on to the national stage. For most of his political life, Odinga has been seen as symbol of resistance and political reform and his death leaves a vacuum about who can fill his shoes and carry on his legacy. He is the son of Jaramogi Odinga, Kenya's first vice-president, who walked out of government after falling out with then-leader Jomo Kenyatta, Uhuru Kenyatta's father.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m39xg4dggo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0a7e/live/f47bf560-a98e-11f0-8cc1-273230b15f0b.jpg,2025-10-15T10:50:39.696000+00:00,798650d36c26662b8e7b620164f2645951932c87
ec23e023dc3c,"China seizes 60,000 maps over 'mislabelled' Taiwan",,"China seizes 60,000 maps over 'mislabelled' Taiwan China Customs Customs officers recently seized a batch of maps bound for export, which they described as ""problematic"" Chinese customs officers in eastern Shandong province have seized 60,000 maps that ""mislabelled"" the self-governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. The maps, authorities said, also ""omitted important islands"" in the South China Sea, where Beijing's claims overlap with those of its neighbours, including the Philippines and Vietnam. The ""problematic"" maps, meant for export, cannot be sold because they ""endanger national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of China, authorities said. Maps are a sensitive topic for China and its rivals for reefs, islands and outcrops in the South China Sea. China Customs said that the maps also did not contain the nine-dash line, which demarcates Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea. The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. The seized maps also did not mark the maritime boundary between China and Japan, authorities said. Authorities said the maps mislabelled ""Taiwan province"", without specifying what exactly the mislabelling was. China sees self-ruled Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Tensions in the South China Sea flare up occassionally - most recently over the weekend, when ships from China and the Philippines figured in another encounter. Manila accused a Chinese ship of deliberately ramming and firing its water cannon at a Philippine government vessel. But Beijing said the incident happened after the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and ""dangerously approached"" the Chinese ship. The Philippines and Vietnam are also particularly sensitive to depictions of the South China Sea in maps. The Barbie movie from 2023 was banned in Vietnam and censored in the Philippines for showing a South China Sea map with the nine dash line. The statement from China Customs did not say where the seized maps were intended to be sold. China supplies much of the world's goods, from Christmas lights to stationery. The confiscation of ""problematic maps"" by Chinese customs officers is not uncommon - though the number of the maps seized in Shandong easily eclipses past seizures. Goods that fail inspection at the customs are destroyed. In March, customs officers at an airport in Qingdao seized a batch of 143 nautical charts that contained ""obvious errors"" in the national borders. In August, customs officers in Hebei province seized two ""problematic maps"" that, among other things, contained a ""misdrawing"" of the Tibetan border.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr1myxe673o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5023/live/c3818e30-a979-11f0-8efc-fbca622d9725.png,2025-10-15T05:51:29.863000+00:00,ad7407010048475fff0f639dfd6ab34ceb1598f1
e7e925d3c241,Government told to prepare for 2C warming by 2050,,"Government told to prepare for 2C warming by 2050 Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor and Tabby Wilson Getty Images The UK should be prepared to cope with weather extremes as a result of at least 2C of global warming by 2050, independent climate advisers have said. The country was ""not yet adapted"" to worsening weather extremes already occurring at current levels of warming, ""let alone"" what was expected to come, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) wrote in a letter addressed to the government. The committee said they would advise that the UK prepare for climate change beyond the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. The CCC said they had been asked to provide advice on a timeframe for setting adaption scenarios, based on ""minimum climate scenarios"". They urged the government to set out a framework of ""clear long-term objectives"" to prevent further temperature rise, with new targets every five years and departments ""clearly accountable"" for delivering those goals. The CCC said they would be able to provide further details on potential ""trade offs"" in May 2026, when they will release a a major report outlining how the UK can adapt to climate change. The committee released their last report in April this year, which said preparations in the UK for rising temperatures were ""either too slow, has stalled, or [are] heading in the wrong direction"". It warned that this lack of progress could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, from hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies. And it said that the impacts of high temperatures were already apparent, for example in schools. The CCC cited preliminary findings from the Department for Education, which reported there were on average 1.7 days of ""extreme overheating"", as well as lost learning time due to heat. Achieving ""net zero"" is the world's key target for fighting climate change, which climate scientists have agreed is already making a serious impact around the globe. The Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 , and saw almost 200 countries pledge to try and prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. As the CCC outlined in their letter, a global warming level of 2C would have significant impact on the UK's weather, with extreme events becoming more frequent and widespread. They said the UK could expect increased heatwaves, drought and flooding, and wildfire season would likely extend into autumn. Baroness Brown, chairwoman of the adaptation committee for the CCC, said: ""People in the UK are already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, and we owe it to them to prepare, and also to help them prepare. ""Adaptation in the UK is not keeping up with the increase in climate risk. The impacts on the UK are getting worse and (the government) needs more ambition,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. The chairwoman also levelled criticism at Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who pledged to scrap the UK's landmark climate change legislation and replace it with a strategy for ""cheap and reliable"" energy. Baroness Brown dubbed the promise ""disappointing"", and said she hoped that the conservative leader would ""reflect on the fact that the act covers both adaption and mitigation"". The UK is already experiencing shifting weather patterns due to climate change, with four official heatwaves confirmed in 2025 across what the Met Office have said was the hottest summer on record. Met Office climate scientists have found that a summer as hot or hotter than 2025 is now 70 times more likely than it would have been in a ""natural"" climate, with no human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24kllyye1o,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/771e/live/645f8050-a97a-11f0-8efc-fbca622d9725.jpg,2025-10-15T06:57:16.535000+00:00,e7589b9a5ee8536bf226a884f04d387321213b51

BBC Sport reported in May that talks were under way about a possible comeback for the 53-year-old. Paratici will hold the position of joint-sporting director with Johan Lange and oversee Spurs' men's football strategy including performance development, scouting and recruitment. He resigned from the role in April 2023 after his appeal against a 30-month Fifa ban for financial irregularities was rejected by Italy's highest sports court. The Italian was banned after Juventus, where he was sporting director and managing director before joining Tottenham in 2021, were found guilty of false accounting and deducted 10 points in Serie A. Last month a judge in Rome accepted a plea bargain request by Paratici and other former Juventus executives, meaning he will not have to serve a 18-month prison sentence. Plea deals in Italy do not involve an admission of guilt or any acceptance of liability. ""I'm delighted to be returning to a club that I love,"" said Paratici. ""I have been working with Johan, Vinai [Venkatesham] and Thomas [Frank] as a consultant for a number of months and I now look forward to returning to London and joining the team full-time. ""I'm convinced that working in partnership with Johan we can build a special future for the club and our supporters.""

71834bf44673,"Football, fashion & the rise of the replica shirt",,"""First and foremost, the easiest way for a kit to become iconic is if the team was successful in it,"" podcast host and football historian Peter Kenny Jones tells BBC Sport. England were famously beaten by West Germany on penalties in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup in Italy but, after decades of underperforming at major tournaments, Bobby Robson's team showcased the skill, determination and strength of character that fans had been calling out for. ""Although England didn't win that tournament, they came home to an open-top bus parade and the whole country gathered around them,"" Jones added. ""Paul Gascoigne become a national hero. Iconic moments like him crying and Gary Lineker asking the bench to have a word."" Not only was there an increase in sales of England shirts during and after Italia '90, the jersey remains a fan favourite to this day. However, it wasn't only the Three Lions jersey from that tournament that caught the imagination. Football fans Doug Bierton and Matthew Dale, who met while studying at university, have turned the sale of retro football shirts into a near-Â£40m business empire. The kit that started it all? The West Germany home shirt worn at that World Cup. ""I think it cost Â£20 in a charity shop in the student area of Manchester. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it,"" Bierton says. Italia '90 was the first major football tournament Bierton watched on TV and it was the initial difficulty in tracking down this specific shirt, worn by the likes of Rudi Voller and Lothar Matthaus, which led him to assume other fans had similar problems when searching for an old jersey. The idea for Classic Football Shirts was born. The company began from a spare bedroom and the first few shirts were bought using Bierton and Dale's student loans. ""My goal was to collect every kit from Italia '90,"" he said. ""But the problem is, they only made half of them that you could buy in the shop. So you've got to dig around, contacting ex-players, going down wormholes to find them. I've ticked off most, but I'm missing four. ""So I need Cameroon 1990 away, United Arab Emirates home, Uruguay home, South Korea home. Then I've got the full set.""

Having resumed on 51-2, they lost first-innings centurion Tony de Zorzi lbw to left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi to the third ball of the day to push the finely-poised chase in Pakistan's favour.

After reaching Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup, Scotland failed to capitalise on that momentum and have missed the last three tournaments. The most recent failure was being absent from this summer's Euros in Switzerland, which was won again by neighbours England. Andreatta is fully aware of what it takes to not only qualify, but to compete, on the world stage. She is convinced Scotland have what is required. ""What I see is the quality players we have, the depth that we're building and looking at to make sure we have a strong 23, because that's what you need,"" she added.

678298dd5e2d,England's Ford signs new three-year deal with Sale,,"England fly-half George Ford has signed a new three-year contract with Prem side Sale Sharks.

Ford, 32, has been with Sale since joining from Leicester Tigers in the summer of 2022, making 44 appearances and racking up 341 points.

In that time, the Sharks have been the only club to finish in the top four in each season although the closest they came to winning the title was losing to Saracens in the final in 2023.

Ford has won 102 caps for England, making his debut in 2014, and was co-captain for the tour of Argentina and the USA in July.

""With the players and the coaches that we have here, I feel like I can still improve and be challenged as a player,"" he said.

""I feel the best place for me to do that is right here.""

Ford has been one of the most consistent players in The Prem since his move to Sale, with the number 10 at the heart of their consistent play and helping them finish second, fourth and third respectively in the regular-season table.

Many observers felt he was unlucky not to be included in the British and Irish Lions squad for the tour of Australia this summer, but missing out enabled him to pick up his 100th England cap in the win over Argentina in La Plata.

He has carried on his good form into the new domestic season, scoring 30 points in Sale's opening three games in The Prem, while he will hope to be part of Steve Borthwick's England squad for next month's four autumn internationals at Allianz Stadium.

""I want to keep playing well for Sale Sharks and I want to keep influencing the team as much as I can,"" said Ford. ""That comes first.

""I love playing for my country but I know that I only get that opportunity if I'm playing consistently well for Sale. So that's my focus.""

For Sale's director of rugby Alex Sanderson, being able to tie down a player of Ford's ability is a huge statement of intent as they try to land a first Prem title since 2006.

""George is in the form of his life and he's a player we've built a team around,"" said Sanderson.

""He's the sort of player who attracts top quality players to want to play for the club because they all want to learn from him.

""George could have his pick of any club in the world and he chooses Sale Sharks and that's big testament to us and what we're building.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cy0yg9ply5wo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/1043/live/b5970aa0-a9a8-11f0-97ec-91b89bd10dfa.jpg,2025-10-15T09:03:56.540000+00:00,5d5ed26f793d29e1e63505b8fe08ee246d964f7a

Rituals and ceremonies are performed before and after each bout, highlighting the traditional nature of the sport. Traditionally before a match, a hole is made in the centre of the dohyo and filled with nuts, squid, seaweed and sake by Shinto priests. The hole is closed, enshrining inside a spirit.

Junior side Benburb FC, who are based in Govan, will embark on a 600-mile round trip to play Wick on 25 October. When former Manchester United manager Sir Alex - who grew up watching Benburb with his father - learned of the club's upcoming journey, he stepped in to pay for overnight accommodation for the team in Caithness. The club's co-manager Gordon Robertson told BBC Scotland the help was ""a wonderful gesture"" from Sir Alex. Sir Alex had visited the club recently, and has often spoken of his fondness for the Govan side, who play in the West of Scotland Football League's first division. Mr Robertson told Good Morning Scotland that Sir Alex was horrified when he learned of the lengthy journey the team faced before playing Wick in the second round of the Scottish Cup. He said: ""It's a six hour trip, and it would have been a big outlay for the club to pay for the players to stay overnight. "" Sir Alex offered to pay for the players and staff to stay overnight before the Wick game. It's a wonderful gesture, and very much appreciated. The players are totally thrilled."" The gesture will let the team rest up the night before, instead of travelling to the Highlands on the day of the game. 'Something special' Benburb upset Cowdenbeath 2-1 in the first round of the competition last month. Victory against Wick would secure a place in the third round draw. Should the Bens progress to the fourth round - when Premiership sides like Celtic, Rangers and Hearts enter the tournament - then they could land a lucrative fixture. Mr Robertson added: ""He was complimentary about the win against Cowdenbeath - they're a couple of tiers above us, so it was a bit of a shock result.  He'd seen the goals and said he hoped he could help us get into the third round. ""We consider him the greatest football manager of all time , so to have him in the corner, with a few kind words from him was good enough - but to help us prepare for the match is something special."" The Benburb co-manager said he believed the Wick game was up for grabs. ""They'll look at us and think it's a winnable game, and we'll look at them and think the same. ""It's a long way to go to, but we're confident - no-one gave us a chance against Cowdenbeath and we went there and beat them on their own patch.

Netflix's hit TV series Adolescence explored toxic masculinity and the impact of mobile phones and social media on teenagers and family life. Graham, whose letter to his own son will be included in the book, told the BBC: ""My hope for this book is that it will be a continuation of the message of Adolescence and a tool for fathers to start more conversations with their sons."" The Bloomsbury book will be made up of a collection of letters from fathers from all walks of life, with submissions open from 15 October until 12 January. In a press statement, Graham added: ""After the huge impact of Adolescence, I realised there was a greater need for communication between fathers and sons. ""There is arguably an even bigger disconnect than ever before, and I would love to help create more opportunity for fathers to reach out to their sons and carry on the conversation. ""We want to hear from men of all ages, first-time fathers, absent fathers, fathers who've been there but never truly been there, fathers who've lost and fathers who just want to find a way to say I love you, to tell their sons what they mean to them and to talk openly about what it means to be a man."" The book will be published in October 2026. Graham is working on the project with psychology lecturer Orly Klein. The pair will make a donation for every letter published to the charity ManUp? and social enterprise Dad La Soul, two organisations that support young men struggling with mental health. Bloomsbury will also make a donation to ManUp?

The UK government supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the ""emerging and growing problem"" the show raised. Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. ""If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood,"" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh . ""It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.""

The 68-year-old was last seen on film in 2017's Phantom Thread, after which his agent released a statement saying he ""will no longer be working as an actor"". But he was tempted back to the screen by the opportunity to work with his son Ronan, who directed and co-wrote his new film Anemone. Asked if he had been swamped with new scripts now that he's returned, Day-Lewis told BBC News: ""No, there's been no inundation. I'm definitely open to the idea of working. ""And just to put the record straight, I never used the word retirement. People have happily used it on my behalf. ""But I felt I needed to work at something else for a while, which I did. I'm glad to be back doing this, and I'm certainly open to doing it again."" Before stepping back from acting in 2017, Day-Lewis was one of cinema's most sought after actors, having won three Oscars and starred in films such as Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. The actor and his son Ronan, 27, co-wrote the script for Anemone, which premiered at the London Film Festival on Tuesday. Universal Pictures Daniel Day-Lewis and director Ronan Day-Lewis discussing a scene Day-Lewis plays Ray, a former soldier living in isolation in the woods, who is sought out by his brother during a family crisis. ""It was just the idea of working with Ronan,"" the actor told BBC News. ""We just thought we'd find a way of doing something together. So it was a very open and unspecific impulse that started it."" Daniel says he and Ronan quickly found that their ideas were well aligned early in the writing process. ""We very soon found our way into some common ground. The idea of a story about brothers, and it went on from there."" 'Brotherly love' The film sees the three-time Oscar winner's character Ray dealing with his difficult past in the military by cutting himself off from society. Years later, his brother finds him, and tries to persuade him to come home to reunite with his ex-wife and son, who is in trouble after assaulting another young man. That kind of fraternal family dynamic was something that Ronan Day-Lewis was keen to explore, when writing the script with his father. ""I have two brothers,"" he explains. ""And for a few years before we had started working together on anything, I'd had the vague idea of wanting to find a way into that, as a kind of archetype in the story. ""Once we both locked into that and realised that we independently had that interest. It was really just a matter of finding these characters and then just following them into the dark."" Universal Pictures Sean Bean and Daniel Day-Lewis in Anemone Ray's brother Jem is played by Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings star Sean Bean. The British actor says it was a pleasure acting opposite someone of the calibre of Day-Lewis's, whom he matches beat for beat in some of the film's most intense scenes. ""Yeah, I was alright,"" laughs Bean. ""He's great to work with. He's very welcoming, he's very generous. ""He's very focused, obviously. We all know his approach to acting, which is admirable. And I just felt very comfortable with that relationship we had together."" 'New themes and emotions' Throughout his career, Day-Lewis has demonstrated his range with a wide variety of roles. Did this one have new themes or emotions that he hadn't tackled before? ""That's a really interesting question,"" he says, pausing to consider it for a few moments. ""I'd say yes, for sure. I think what happened inadvertently was it also became an exploration about the generations of relationships between fathers and sons. ""And that's something, for my own personal reasons, has preoccupied me since childhood. And so I think that certainly became something that was really new and interesting to me.""

a5b80cb9d94f,'The first time sci-fi was presented as serious drama': The forgotten 1960s show that was the original Black Mirror,,"Out of the Unknown was the idea of pioneering producer, Irene Shubik. Initially working as story editor at the now defunct UK broadcaster ABC television on the show Armchair Theatre, her enthusiasm for sci-fi eventually led to the production of 13 episodes of the series Out of This World (1962) for UK broadcaster ITV. Later, Shubik was story editor on the BBC anthology series Story Parade (1964-65) which was a series of standalone adaptations of modern novels, and which tellingly dramatised Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel. The success of both ventures convinced the BBC Head of Drama Sydney Newman, who had worked with Shubik at ABC, that she should devise an anthology show dedicated to intellectual sci-fi. I think that science-fiction is a way of talking about now and the world we live in today, but disguised as something fun… You can bend the rules of your reality into a funhouse mirror version of the issue you're talking about – Charlie Brooker Television historian Jon Dear explains the initial rationale behind the series. ""Out of the Unknown was really the first time that sci-fi was presented as serious and intelligent adult drama,"" he tells the BBC. ""Today, series like Alien: Earth and Andor are unremarkable as being made for adults, and obviously have their origins in cinema, but this series was the first time many people would have watched speculative fiction, having found things like Doctor Who too juvenile."" The series began broadcasting in 1965, with its first story, John Wyndham's No Place Like Earth, going out on 4 October. Shubik produced the first two series, comprised of 26 episodes, before leaving to pursue other work, handing over to producer Alan Bromly, who took over for a further two series that ran from 1969 to 1971. Out of the Unknown boasted a wealth of talent behind and in front of the camera. As well as the great writers whose work was adapted, each episode was populated by the very best of British character actors such as former Doctor Who Patrick Troughton, future leading man David Hemmings and noted faces from British theatre including Yvonne Mitchell, Sylvia Coleridge and Lynn Farleigh, to name but a few.

dbbf66edc92f,"Vets should be made to publish prices, watchdog says",,"Vets should be made to publish prices, watchdog says Michael Sheils McNamee business reporter and Jim Connolly & Abi Smitton BBC News Investigations Getty Images Vets should be forced to publish price lists so pet owners can see costs up front and shop around for the best deal, the competition watchdog has said. Owners are often unaware of prices or not given estimates for treatments that can run into thousands of pounds, its investigation into soaring vet costs found. Vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also found. The CMA's proposals included making vets reveal if they are part of a large group, capping prescription fees and banning bonuses on offering specific treatments. There are no standardised prices for treatments, and the initial CMA investigation found 84% of vet practice websites had no pricing information at all. It comes after a BBC File on Four investigation in April found vet bills had skyrocketed, and heard from whistleblowers inside the industry who blamed higher bills on big companies buying up practices. Hundreds of pet owners contacted Your Voice, Your BBC News , with concerns over vet bills. Vets and animal charities told the BBC in June pet owners are increasingly having their sick animals put down or they are delaying taking them for treatment to avoid spiralling vet bills. '£12,000 in vet bills' Steve Fildes / BBC Nicole put her wedding plans on hold after paying £12,000 for Ernie's vet bills Nicole Hawley, 26, got in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News after receiving an unexpected £12,000 bill to treat her dog Ernie, after he inhaled a grass seed while out on a walk and it became infected. ""We were given two choices by the emergency vet, either put him down or pay an extortionate bill for surgery,"" she told the BBC. Ms Hawley was in the process of finding a different pet insurance provider for Ernie when he fell ill, meaning she didn't have financial support. She and her partner ended up taking out a loan to pay for the procedure, and used money they had been saving for their wedding. ""We didn't have the money. But it took us five minutes to decide that we would find it from somewhere,"" Ms Hawley said. Many vets offer a monthly subscription which covers check-ups, vaccinations and regular flea and worm treatments for dogs and cats but the price and services included vary between practices. Veterinary prices had increased by 63% over a seven year period, which was nearly twice the rate of inflation, the CMA's Martin Coleman, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Many people were paying twice what they needed to for vet medicines,"" he said. ""It's not right to keep pet owners in the dark about key matters that affect them and their pets and their pockets. ""We're often not being told up-front basic information such as who owns the practice, the price of commonly used services, and we're not often given estimates of the likely price of treatment costing hundreds, even thousands of pounds."" The CMA also found practices owned by large vet groups charge 16.6% more on average than independent vets. Mr Coleman said the regulatory system was set up in 1966, ""when the world of veterinary services was very different to the world that we have today."" ""There is regulation of individual vets, but there is no regulation of the businesses that own the majority of the practices in the country,"" Mr Coleman said. The British Veterinary Association welcomed the recommendations for greater transparency and reform of the regulatory system, but president Dr Rob Williams said the association did have some concerns. ""In particular, we need clarity on the proposed introduction of comprehensive price lists, because how vet care is delivered is varied and complex and unless the CMA gets this right, it could end up creating greater confusion for consumers,"" he said. Lee Durant / BBC Francesca Verney says vets struggle to talk about money Francesca Verney, Veterinary Director at independent practice Pet People, contacted the BBC after a previous report on the price of vet bills .

It is the third-largest fine the communications watchdog has ever issued and follows its investigation after Royal Mail missed its targets for both first and second-class post in 2024/25. Ian Strawhorne, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: ""Millions of important letters are arriving late, and people aren't getting what they pay for when they buy a stamp."" Royal Mail said it will ""continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service"". It delivered 77% of First Class mail and 92.5% of Second Class mail on time in the 2024/25 financial year, which was short of its 93% and 98.5% targets. This is the third time it has been fined over delivery delays in recent years, with penalities of £5.6m in November 2023 and £10.5m in December 2024 . Ofcom said the fine would have been £30m, but it had reduced it by 30% to reflect Royal Mail's admission of its failings. The regulator warned fines were ""likely to continue"" unless the company urgently delivers ""a credible improvement plan"". 'Empty promises' Ofcom said Royal Mail published an improvement plan for last year, aimed at delivering 85% of first-class post on time and 97% of second-class post, but ""this has not materialised"". Mr Strawhorne said: ""Royal Mail must rebuild consumers' confidence as a matter of urgency. And that means making actual significant improvements, not more empty promises."" Ofcom's investigation found the company ""breached its obligations by failing to provide an acceptable level of service without justification"". It said the actions taken by Royal Mail to try and reach its targets were ""insufficient and ineffective"". The fine, Ofcom said, reflected the ""harm suffered by customers"" as a result of Royal Mail's poor service. Citizens Advice said the postal service's track record was ""woeful"" but that the fines may not push the company to do better. ""When these failures are just an ordinary part of doing business, Ofcom's fine risks becoming another operating cost, doing little to encourage the company to improve its service,"" Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said. ""Missed post has real life consequences, with people left waiting for urgent medical appointment letters, legal documents and benefit decisions."" Second-class scrapped on Saturdays Under the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. Since July, some areas only receive second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturday , a change proposed by Ofcom earlier this year. Responding to Ofcom, a Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We acknowledge the decision made by Ofcom today and we will continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service."" The spokesperson said that the reduction of second-class deliveries in some areas enabled the company to ""drive a step change in quality of service"". Royal Mail has also made changes in recruitment and training and has provided more support in delivery offices, the spokesperson added. The fine will be paid to the Treasury.

b71541283fa9,Top European clubs discuss using six substitutes,,"Five substitutes were introduced in the Premier League in May 2020 before football resumed during the coronavirus pandemic. The league reverted back to three for the 2020-21 season, before five was voted in permanently from the 2022-23 season. A sixth substitute is allowed to replace a player without a suspected head injury. Three extra squad places are seen as being able to reduce the workload on players after threats of strikes. Last season Tottenham defender Archie Gray was included in 80 matchday squads for club and country, including friendlies, the joint highest in Europe with Real Madrid's 20-year-old midfielder Arda Guler. Gray, 19, made 48 appearances as Spurs won the Europa League and helped England Under-21s win Euro 2025 in the summer. Sources close to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) have doubts if 28-man squads would help players, given it would not stop them from travelling in a matchday squad or ease mental fatigue regardless of whether they play. In June Uefa, the EFC, FifPro Europe and European Leagues launched a study to better assess different types of injuries, performance levels and player welfare. Last month FifPro, the world players' union, released its fifth annual report on the issue, looking at how much players played and travelled in 2024-25. It wrote: ""Even if the player does not end up playing any minutes, they still have to be physically present and fully participate in team preparations, mentally prepare, while often spending time away from home and undertaking international travel. ""As such, these occasions are also part of the player's working time commitments.""

d589ef6fe9ee,Tory leader relives acid attack as he hits out at parole system,,"Tory leader relives acid attack as he hits out at parole system Getty Images Russell Findlay says the parole system needs ""dragging into the 21st Century"" Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay has hit out at Scotland's parole system as the man who attacked him with acid 10 years ago is considered for release. Findlay was working an investigative journalist for the Sun newspaper when William Burns knocked on his door disguised as a postman and threw corrosive liquid at his face. As Burns makes a bid for parole, Findlay criticised the lack of transparency in the system which considers when inmates are freed. He told BBC Scotland News that crime victims across Scotland were being denied ""basic information"" and the process needed to be ""dragged into the 21st Century"". Findlay recalled the incident in December 2015, when he opened the front door of his Glasgow home to Burns two days before Christmas. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""He distracted me by getting me to sign a document. ""As I was looking down, he threw what turned out to be sulphuric acid into my face. ""I was extremely fortunate in that it only caught half my face. ""I was even more fortunate when the police turned up and the knife he was carrying was lying on the threshold."" ""And I was even more fortunate in that my daughter, who was then aged 10, raised the alarm. Findlay was able to quickly wash away the acid with water, meaning he avoided any permanent scarring. He added: ""I was able with a bit of good luck to detain Burns until the police arrived to take him away. ""Every single thing that could have gone right in those moments did."" William Burns was jailed in 2017 for 15 years over the acid attack Findlay, who became an MSP in 2021, often worked on stories about organised crime and ""dangerous individuals"" during his previous 30-year career in journalism. He took precautions such as never allowing his photograph to appear on his stories. He said: ""Organised crime in Scotland is deep-rooted, wealthy and powerful. ""We've seen in the past decade they've gone after prisoners, they've gone after police officers, they've gone after lawyers - they're capable of anything."" The publicity after the acid attack raised his profile but he took the view that if ""keeping your head down"" was unable to keep attackers away from his front door, then maybe it was better to speak out. ""There's no point in hiding away, so perhaps being visible and being outspoken is the best form of defence,"" he said. At his trial Burns said he only intended to ""beat up"" Findlay who he claimed had told him he had a compromising photo showing him with a young blonde woman. The jury rejected his suggestion that Findlay had thrown the acid at himself, and the judge jailed him for 15 years, with a minimum custody term of 10 years. The attack took place months after Burns was freed early from a previous15-year jail term for shooting a woman during a post office robbery. Burns was also accused of involvement in a gangland shooting in Bishopbriggs earlier in 2015, but was later acquitted after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence. Modernisation call Findlay said he accepted Burns would be released from prison at some point but he was annoyed by the lack of transparency around a parole process which he said denied victims ""the most basic information"". ""All I get to know is whether a decision to grant to deny parole is made,"" he said. ""I'm not allowed to know where the hearing takes place, who sits on the board, I'm not allowed to know what evidence is led by him - so therefore cannot challenge it. ""I'm not allowed to know the reasons why a decision is reached and that's not just about me complaining about a lack of transparency. ""That applies to crime victims the length and breadth of Scotland."" Findlay said the early release of prisoners risked undermining public faith around sentencing and he pointed out that in other parts of the UK victims of crime are allowed to attend parole hearings. ""We just need to be dragged into the 21st Century,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The parole system could work better for everyone, which is why we are making changes through the Victims, Witnesses, and Justice Reform Bill, and why we currently have a public consultation on parole reforms that includes key areas of communication and transparency. ""It will be informed by direct engagement with victims and their families as well as other justice partners. ""Hearing about direct experience is essential to developing a more person-centred, trauma-informed system.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2d4dnl1dyo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/caa7/live/9f11c7d0-a9b6-11f0-a923-ff705558ae00.jpg,2025-10-15T11:20:55.612000+00:00,13c13d82022c69b9d48f4684953c03181670fa03

d4b6e2710d52,"'With service, Hojlund is a 25-goal-a-year striker'",,"Scott McTominay showed Manchester United what they had wrongly discarded last season and his new Napoli team-mate Rasmus Hojlund will follow suit this campaign, according to ex-goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. The 22-year-old has scored four goals in six games for the Serie A leaders since his summer loan switch, which includes a clause to make the deal permanent. That tally is the same as the number of Premier League goals he managed for United in the previous campaign. McTominay moved in the same direction 12 months earlier, with his title-winning form in Italy earning the Scotland midfielder Serie A's player of the year award and a Ballon d'Or nomination. Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles at Old Trafford, remains bewildered by the decision to sell McTominay and questions the wisdom of parting with his fellow Dane Hojlund and replacing him with Benjamin Sesko. ""At United you've got a head coach [Ruben Amorim], then you had a director of football [Dan Ashworth], a technical director or whatever Jason Wilcox's title is, and you've got a head of recruitment [Christopher Vivell], who is very powerful,"" he told BBC podcast Sacked in the Morning. ""You've got a lot of people deciding on who is coming in. ""For instance, the signing of Benjamin Sesko was a little bit weird to me because we have Rasmus Hojlund, who has been starved of service for two years. ""You only have to see what he's doing at Napoli with Kevin de Bruyne and Scott McTominay to play with - he's scoring goals. ""I've consistently said this for two-and-a-half years - Rasmus Hojlund will be a 25-goal-a-year striker for Manchester United, but he needs service. ""We let him go on the stats that he scored very little goals last season and bring Sesko in at the time we bring in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo, who would give Hojlund first-class service. ""You spend Â£70m-plus on Sesko, when we don't have the number six we should have, and there's the goalkeeping position as well. ""This season alone we've conceded nine goals from goalkeeping errors. When I played, when Edwin van der Sar played, when David de Gea played, the brief was win 10 points a season, you don't give points away. ""Why did we bring someone in that we didn't need? Because the head of recruitment comes from Leipzig [also Sesko's former club] and he's got to make a mark. ""When I played, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] was in charge.

02f074f2dfdd,D'Angelo: The pioneer who charted a new course for soul music,,"D'Angelo: The pioneer who charted a new course for soul music Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Getty Images There aren't many musicians whose sound is so distinctive and influential that the music industry invents a whole new genre to describe it. But D'Angelo, who has died at the age of 51, was seen as a trailblazer, thanks in large part to his groundbreaking debut album Brown Sugar, released in July 1995. With its slow tempos and smooth vocals, D'Angelo's chilled-out, late-night vibe recalled some of the legends of soul while also sounding entirely new. R&B was already popular at the time - with TLC, Mary J Blige and Janet Jackson among the stars riding high in the charts. But Brown Sugar's more laid-back sound blended rhythm and blues with crisp hip-hop beats, jazz and funk, differentiating it from the more pop-skewing R&B dominating radio at the time. The album's sound was christened ""neo-soul"" - and its influence is still being felt three decades after its release. D'Angelo's music still crops up on streaming service playlists with titles such as ""Relaxed evening vibes"" and ""Chilled soul classics"". It still soundtracks dinner parties and date nights. And D'Angelo is cited as an influence not only by the artists who were his peers at the time, but by newer talents emerging today. ""He was so important, and still is,"" Welsh hip-hop artist Lemfreck, who has been championed by BBC Introducing, told Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""That neo-soul sound from the 90s and noughties is the base layer for every single layer of R&B you hear to this day."" Getty Images A huge number of artists such as Erykah Badu (left) and Jill Scott were part of the neo-soul movement Admittedly, the music industry is used to coming up with buzzy names to make an unfamiliar genre more marketable. Trip-hop was invented to help categorise Portishead and Massive Attack in the mid-90s, while the term Crunk was coined to onomatopaeically reflect the bass-heavy club sounds of Southern hip-hop. Neo-soul was christened by D'Angelo's own manager Kedar Massenburg, a US record producer who would later serve as president of Motown Records. Seeing the market potential, but also just sensing a rapidly growing movement, Massenburg trademarked the term neo-classic soul, telling Billboard in 2002 that there was ""the need to categorise music for consumers so they know what they're getting"". The term caught on, and a huge number of neo-soul artists followed in D'Angelo's footsteps, some of them signed by Massenburg himself. Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was released a year after Brown Sugar, while Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild, India Arie and D'Angelo's former partner Angie Stone would launch albums over the following years, a time seen as neo-soul's golden era. But Brown Sugar had already set the genre's blueprint. Getty Images D'Angelo, pictured in 1996, only released three studio albums in his career The album's sales might have been slow at first, but its breakout hits Lady, Brown Sugar and Cruisin' all made the Billboard R&B chart, and helped the record eventually reach two million in sales. D'Angelo ""emerged as a nostalgic figure in modern soul,"" said Pitchfork's Marcus J Moore. ""His blend of 1970s R&B and hip-hop felt uniquely vintage and modern. He appealed to wide swaths of listeners and helped usher in a new strain of black music."" However, as is often the case with a successful debut album, D'Angelo struggled to follow it up. He toured Brown Sugar for two years but then hit a wall while trying to work on his second record. ""The thing about writer's block is that you want to write so badly, [but] the songs don't come out that way,"" he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008. ""They come from life. So you've got to live to write."" The infrequency with which he released music made D’Angelo’s albums much more of an event when they eventually appeared. Much like Lauryn Hill, with whom he collaborated on Nothing Even Matters for her Miseducation album, D'Angelo's towering influence was even more notable for his comparatively low level of output. Getty Images D'Angelo hosted an anti-gun violence assembly at a school in Los Angeles in 2000 Brown Sugar's follow-up, Voodoo, was eventually released in 2000, and hailed by critics as a triumph. With production from Questlove and J Dilla, its sound leaned slightly more towards hip-hop than his debut, with more pulsing percussion and a collaboration with Method Man and Redman. But it was the seven-minute music video for its third single Untitled (How Does It Feel) that attracted the headlines. Filmed all in one take, the video saw D'Angelo's face filmed close up, before the camera pulling back to reveal him standing completely naked. D'Angelo certainly had the body to pull off the video, which went on to be nominated for three MTV VMAs, including Video of the Year. ""We made this music video for women,"" said its director Paul Hunter. ""The idea was, it would feel like he was one-on-one with whoever the woman was."" The stripped-back appearance reflected the stripped-back sound of the song - the arrangement saw the instruments lower in the mix to give D'Angelo's layered harmonies centre stage. The frenzied reaction to Untitled pushed Voodoo to number one in the US for two weeks, and in 2001 it won the Grammy for best R&B album (the singer won four Grammy Awards from 14 nominations throughout his career). Getty Images Going shirtless brought D'Angelo more fame - but he later became uncomfortable with his status as a sex symbol But D'Angelo, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, was uncomfortable with his new status as a sex symbol. He already had a strained relationship with fame, which led to prolonged periods of time away from the spotlight. The success of Voodoo and his shirtless music video led him to leave showbusiness for what would become a 14-year break before his next album. He struggled with depression and alcohol and drug abuse, entering rehab twice, and nearly died in a 2005 car crash. In the same year, he was given a three-year suspended sentence for cocaine possession. A 2008 article in Spin magazine questioned where D'Angelo had disappeared to, and asked his friends and colleagues if there was any prospect of him returning to music. D'Angelo's former music manager, Dominique Trenier, told the magazine that both he and the singer had been disappointed by the reaction to Untitled's music video, which had come to define D'Angelo's career. ""I feel really guilty, because that was never the intention,"" Trenier said. ""I'm glad to video did what it did, but he and I were both disappointed because, to this day, in the general populace's memory, he's the naked dude."" Getty Images D'Angelo released his third and final album Black Messiah in 2014 But he got back on track, signing a new deal which would ultimately lead to his third and final studio album, 2014's Black Messiah. The vocals were unmistakably D'Angelo, but the album had a somewhat different sound. His electric guitar playing featured much more heavily on the album, giving it a more rocky sound - and earning comparisons to Funkadelic’s influential 1971 album, Maggot Brain. The singer also experimented with psychedelia on an album which was sonically more abstract than his first two, and featured more overtly political lyrics, partly inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement which developed after the police shootings of black men. It was, perhaps, a rejection of the neo-soul label. ""I never claimed I do neo-soul,"" he said in a 2014 interview with Red Bull Music Academy. ""When I first came out, I used to always say: 'I do black music. I make black music.'"" Even Massenburg, who had invented the phrase, acknowledged: ""A lot of people don't like the term because, when you classify music, it becomes a fad, which tends to go away."" Getty Images Lauryn Hill, pictured in 2023, praised D'Angelo for projecting an image of ""strength and sensitivity in black manhood"" D'Angelo may have been uncomfortable with cultural moments most closely associated with him - but he will perhaps be best remembered as an inspiration. Paying tribute to D'Angelo on X on Wednesday, Hill said: ""Thank you for charting the course and for making space during a time when no similar space really existed. ""You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other."" Lemfreck reflects: ""He was probably the first artist I heard where I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, you really can do it your own way. You really can make the thing that is right without having to appeal to the masses and still appeal to the masses’. ""The fact that he created the stuff that he did, and how he did it, is a testament to the fact that artistry always comes first.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e5e3j75vo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/856e/live/651f6030-a9c2-11f0-ab49-412d477b922a.jpg,2025-10-15T12:23:03.598000+00:00,b224d5c7477761b4a9ec8f1d2ec4d4c0664a4f9f

Mayall, who grew up in Droitwich, Worcestershire, became one of the country's most famous performers before he died aged 56 in 2014 . The pair met when they were teenagers at the University of Manchester and went on to work on the BBC comedy The Young Ones, as well as Blackadder and Filthy Rich and Catflap. ""Rik was a dear, dear friend - we had our very first professional associations together, which resulted in a spectacular success with The Young Ones,"" he told BBC Hereford and Worcester. ""I met him when I was 18 at university but he wasn't a perfect person, no-one is."" Elton has just released his autobiography - What have I done? - of which he said Mayall was a large part. Steve Rapport/Getty Images Rik Mayall died in 2014 at the age of 56 ""He's sort of part of the DNA of the book and he's threaded through it a great deal,"" he said. ""My relationship with him was so…I would say passionate, in as much as we had a creative meeting of minds which was explosive, and that of course can lead to frictions and can lead to difficulties."" Elton said it was a ""complicated"" relationship. ""It was a very close friendship and a very fractured working relationship,"" he said. ""As it broke away, there was a lot of pain there as well. ""The book actually opens at his funeral because that was the first really true major tragic loss of my life."" He added that writing it allowed him work through some of his grief over Mayall's death. ""Losing somebody far too young, that is a tragedy and Rik's death, I think, shocked us all so very much and I still think about it all the time,"" he said. A patron of the comedy festival in Mayall's memory , which was held for the first time in May, Elton said if he could be involved with next year's event, he would.

Ian Price, 52, was attacked by two dogs outside a property in Stonnall, Staffordshire on 14 September 2023, and died later in hospital. Just hours later, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the XL bully breed would be banned in England and Wales. At Stafford Crown Court, James Harrison Trimble-Pettitt, 32, admitted two counts of being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and he is due to be sentenced on 5 January. A number of people attempted to help Mr Price during the attack by trying to get the dogs off him, Staffordshire Police said. One of the dogs died during the incident, the force confirmed, while the other was given a lethal injection by a vet inside the owner's flat. Family Ian Price died in hospital after he was attacked by two XL Bullies In a statement following Trimble-Pettitt's guilty plea, Mr Price's family thanked members of the public who tried to help, the emergency services and hospital staff. ""Our family has been overwhelmed by the love and support shown to us since that dreadful day and we thank you all for your kind words and actions,"" they said. ""Ian was full of life and loved by many. Anyone who knew him will remember his enthusiasm and passion for life but, above all, his kind and generous spirit."" Trimble-Pettitt originally pleaded guilty in January but on a basis that the dogs' escape was due to a momentary lapse of concentration, police said. This basis of plea was not accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service and a trial of issue began on Monday. A trial of issue is where the defendant admits an offence on the basis of a different version of facts from that put forward by the prosecution. 'Catastrophic' Thomas Schofield, defending, told the court on Monday the defendant wanted to avoid putting Mr Price's family through a ""stressful"" hearing. Prosecution barrister Peter Grieves-Smith said Trimble-Pettit, who looked sombre in the dock and wore a black suit and tie, had ""arrogantly disregarded his responsibilities"" as a dog owner. He admitted full culpability on Tuesday, during the trial's second day. Det Supt Cheryl Hannan, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""Ian's injuries, caused by the dogs attacking him, were catastrophic and he tragically died a short time later. ""The simple fact is that Trimble-Pettitt didn't secure his dogs properly and Ian's death could have been avoided.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41dqgpk2jo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/23f5/live/9b16d3d0-a9b3-11f0-a923-ff705558ae00.jpg,2025-10-15T12:04:45.921000+00:00,94ee7ba256821c449d9165b3d746cb85101b0357

Epping Forest District Council is seeking to block migrants lodging at The Bell Hotel in Epping, which was the scene of vociferous protests over the summer. Lawyers for the authority accused Somani Hotels of ""sidestepping"" planning laws due to ""the lure of a trove of government-funded profits"". The Home Office, which intervened in the case, argued the closure of asylum hotels must be ""structured"" and gradual. The Conservative-led council wants a permanent injunction, while Somani Hotels and the Home Office have opposed the claim. A judge previously awarded the council a temporary injunction prior to the latest hearing, but this was later overturned . PA Media The Bell Hotel was the focal point of intense protests and counter-protests over the summer, some turning violent Opening the council's case, Philip Coppel KC said the hotel was breaching planning controls in a ""serious, flagrant and continuing"" way. He said the owner had ""flagrantly"" changed its use of the hotel, ""without bothering to apply"" for planning permission. Mr Coppel argued this change was having a ""significant adverse impact"" on people living, working and visiting the town. ""A person wanting to stay in Epping cannot book a room there. A person cannot even visit there,"" he said in written submissions to the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. ""A hotel contributes to the amenity of the vicinity - those living and working there. ""It does not attract weekly protests and draw in unlawful activity."" The Bell Hotel became the focus of several protests and counter-protests in the summer, some of which turned violent, after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with two sexual assaults. Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national who arrived in the UK on a small boat days before the incident, was jailed for a year in September . The hotel has been housing asylum seekers in spells since October 2022. Getty Images Lawyers for Somani Hotels said the venue had been in financial decline ""for many years"" Mr Coppel accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of allowing her judgement to be clouded by the need to house those migrants. But James Strachan KC, for the Home Office, said block booking rooms ""does not change its use as a hotel"". He argued it was not in the public interest to grant an injunction, when considering ""the backdrop of multiple other local authorities seeking similar"" rulings. Representing Somani Hotels, Jenny Wigley KC said the business had been in financial decline ""for many years"". She added there had been no changes to the building's structure and the only external changes were to install security fencing in response to the protests.

Ms Leveque died after being stabbed more than 25 times on her neck and chest. Claire Leveque Aren Pearson said Claire Leveque stabbed herself Pearson admitted stabbing Ms Leveque in a call to a 999 operator and also confessed to police officers at the crime scene. Jurors heard that Pearson's late mother Hazel Pearson, who died in May, had told police that on the evening of the murder her son had walked into the kitchen and returned with a knife. He stabbed himself in the neck and told her that he had hurt his girlfriend. Ms Pearson then found Ms Leveque in the hot tub, which was in a shed at her home.

b87fe90755d4,Boy's hotel pool death was drowning accident,,"Boy's hotel pool death was drowning accident David Grundy BBC Wales, Pontypridd Coroner's Court Family Photo Theo Treharne-Jones was on holiday with his parents, siblings and extended family A five-year-old who died on a family holiday in Greece drowned accidentally, a coroner has concluded. Theo Treharne-Jones, from Merthyr Tydfil, was found unconscious in a swimming pool at Atlantica Holiday Village in Kos, a Greek island, on 15 June 2019. The inquest heard that Theo, who had been diagnosed with Smith-Magenis syndrome, displayed ""autistic behaviours"" which meant he often woke up at night and was less naturally cautious. Theo had been able to leave the hotel room as there was no chain on the door. The assistant coroner issued a prevention of future deaths report and said he would send it to the tour operator and travel agents to protect other vulnerable children or adults. The inquest at Pontypridd coroner's court heard that, despite his family placing obstacles, including two buggies and a suitcase, in front of their hotel room door, Theo managed to escape. Mum Nina Treharne previously recounted how the family had gone to bed, after dinner the night before Theo was found in the water, and were woken up by shouting in the morning. ""There was banging and someone was shouting: 'There's a child in the pool, there's a child in the pool.' It was like waking up to a nightmare."" Despite the efforts of other holidaymakers and hotel staff to resuscitate him, Theo was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Ms Treharne told the inquest their room had a standard hotel door lock. When they had stayed at the hotel previously, in another room, the door did have a door chain. TUI's general manager for overseas health and safety, Libby Jones, said following Theo's death, the tour operator had considered whether it was feasible to install door chains on all hotel rooms. ""It's not meant as a locking mechanism to keep you in the room, it's a security feature to prevent entry,"" she said. Ms Jones said TUI had considered whether it was possible, practical or safe to install chains on the doors at all of its hotels. She said it was deemed too great a fire risk. ""We didn't want people fumbling about in the dark, in possibly a smoke-filled room, trying to undo a lock,"" she said. ""We did consider it, but decided not to go ahead."" 'Hazardous' Assistant Coroner Gavin Knox issued a prevention of future deaths report on Wednesday which he said he would sent to TUI and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) regarding Theo's death. ""I am still concerned that families with vulnerable children or adults are still in the position where somebody may potentially leave their room unsupervised and face a number of scenarios which are hazardous,"" said Mr Knox. He said he had evidence that TUI had already considered fire safety to be a priority and could not make specific recommendations to them. ""I cannot guarantee that any changes will be made,"" said Mr Knox, but said he hoped they will consider looking at the issue of door chains again. He paid tribute to those who helped try to resuscitate Theo and passed on his condolences to the boy's parents.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9p4y4q8q9o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/276e/live/c10a9190-a9b7-11f0-8da2-811fba9518ff.jpg,2025-10-15T12:11:13.055000+00:00,b4884549d35999cc1db40390df8174299c9c8a12

'An amazing experience' Ulster University Dr Sneddon said the game is ""compelling"" Although the history is compelling, Dr Sneddon said that the story had to be turned into a compelling game too. ""You don't want just a slab of history, it has to work as a game,"" he said. ""It's been an amazing experience for an historian just to work with so many talented and creative people. ""And go outside my comfort area and work in film and in animation and all sorts of things I never thought I would do. ""I'm actually in the game as a Scottish preacher so you might hear me!""

Dr McCollum said the game is historically accurate from the architecture of the buildings to the costume to the characters. ""You either believe some of the supernatural happenings that are said to have happened or you don't, and the world kind of changes as you move through the game. She explained that the players choices matter. ""It's called a witch's fate, where you will decide if the witches are innocent or guilty and of course that has consequences,"" she said. Ulster University UU game design lecturers Brian Coyle and Sabrina Minter said making the game was a labour of love The way in which players experience the world of 1711 is varied, including a Virtual Reality (VR) app simulating the experience of being accused of witchcraft, a graphic novel adaptation, sounds and archival documents, as well as the gameplay. For UU game design lecturers Brian Coyle and Sabrina Minter, making the game was a labour of love, but it is not the end of the journey.

6741c2c5ddf7,What more do we know about the collapsed China spy case?,,"What more do we know about the collapsed China spy case? Helen Catt Political correspondent and Chris Mason Political editor Watch: PM says government will publish witness statements in China spy case The row over why the case of two men accused of spying for China collapsed continues to rumble on and on for the government (not least, of course, because the opposition senses it is worth stoking). The government does seem to have painted itself into a corner over the release of witness statements related to the case. Suggesting that the Crown Prosecution Service was stopping their release, only for the CPS to say they weren't, makes it very awkward to do anything other than publish them. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer clarified that the government would do just that . The PM saw those documents for the first time this morning. It was an unusual start to the weekly question session - with the prime minister making that pledge in a statement, rather than in response to questions from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch - something Badenoch was not expecting. There is an additional question, though, over whether the statements will really change anything. Unless they show something radically different to the situation that has so far been discussed, the central allegation here hasn't been that the government toned down evidence, but that it perhaps could have provided more and chose not to. The government maintains that's not the case and the publication of the statements may not shed any more light on that. Of course, these documents could put some more pressure on the CPS, as opposed to politicians. Let's see. Barring any surprises, it is unlikely to draw a line under this story - for the government or for those asking the questions. The Conservatives have been keen to keep up the pressure. There is danger though. The government's response throughout this has been to claim it was the Conservatives' position on China and the state of legislation which they did not change that is to blame. AFP/Getty Images Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for China After PMQs, there are briefings with the prime minister's team and Badenoch's team. This week, they lasted around an hour and 20 minutes. That, for the avoidance of doubt, is a long time by the standards of these things. The documents coming later - and it looks like that will be later today - sound like they'll be quite chunky. What else have we learnt? The final submission of evidence from the government's deputy national security adviser was submitted on 4 August this year. On 1 September, the National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, and the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, Sir Oliver Robbins, held a meeting in which what is described as the ""bilateral handling"" of the then forthcoming court case was discussed. In other words, how to deal with China when a big, high profile court case about alleged spying is under way. The government maintains that this meeting didn't get into the evidence relating to the case. The Conservatives say hang on, No 10 hasn't always been clear about this meeting — and it is a meeting that happened before the case collapsed on 15 September. They are now demanding the minutes of that meeting are published. The prime minister did find out the case was collapsing two days before it did, but those in government won't say how he found out. All of this just reinforces how complicated the detail of this story is and how much longer the questioning of it might go on.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09ezx0qn4o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/45e2/live/aa0dcc70-a9d3-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-15T14:28:57.689000+00:00,3366ed68f24d0c8b58f523368e2e25e20b2fe0eb
f66516561114,Controversial UK oil field publishes full scale of climate impact,,"The UK's largest undeveloped oil field has revealed the full scale of its environmental impact, should it gain approval by the government. Developers of the Rosebank oil field said nearly 250 million tonnes of planet warming gas would be released from using oil products from the field. The amount would vary each year, but by comparison the UK's annual emissions in 2024 were 371 million tonnes. The field's developer said its emissions were ""not significant"" considering the UK's international climate commitments. Rosebank is an oil and gas field which lies about 80 miles north-west of Shetland and is one of the largest undeveloped discoveries of fossil fuels in UK waters. It is said to contain up to 300 million barrels of oil and some gas, and is owned by Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy. The field was originally approved in 2023, but in July a court ruled that a more detailed assessment of the field's environmental impact was required, taking into account the effect on the climate of burning any fossil fuels extracted from it. A public consultation has now been opened, and will run until 20th November 2025. The final decision on whether to approve the field will be made by the Energy Secretary. Until recently such projects were only required to consider the impact on the environment from extracting the fossil fuels. But in June last year the Supreme Court ruled that authorities must take account of the impact from also using the products, after a woman in Surrey challenged the development of her local gas project. This ruling was then used in a further challenge to the Rosebank oil field by environmental campaigners Uplift and Greenpeace - which was subsequently successful in January. Equinor was required to recalculate the ""full impact"" of the field and it now estimates that it will contribute an additional 249 million tonnes of the planet warming gas CO2 over the next 25 years. This is more than 50 times greater than the original figure of 4.5 million tonnes it gave from extracting the oil and gas. The UK has a target to produce no additional emissions by 2050 and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has been vocal about the need to move away from fossil fuels. On Tuesday, he told an industry conference that the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles' heel"" and argued clean power was the only way to reduce bills. The fossil fuels for the Rosebank field are not guaranteed to be used in the UK but would be sold on the international market. As such the project is unlikely to have an impact on lowering gas prices. The UK's independent climate advisors said in 2022 that any more domestic oil and gas extraction would have ""at most, a marginal effect on prices"". But Arne Gurtner, Equinor's senior vice president for the UK, has previously said that: ""If the UK needs Rosebank oil, it will go to the UK through open market mechanisms.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xzgdqw3ro,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ce7/live/c12f9c60-a9d0-11f0-aa31-b1f6905de5c6.jpg,2025-10-15T14:44:09.015000+00:00,6368cb19683dd19bafd8169f0a4a1424d5e9604d

The report detailed how Caicedo travelled almost 25,000km to play four matches in 14 days for club and country in October 2024. It read: ""In 14 days Caicedo played a total of 360 minutes across two continents and three countries, with an average recovery time of 110.8 hours, while flying more than half the length of the equator."" It also said Caicedo ""made 27 trips across borders and was in transit for 175.6 hours"" last season. Chelsea's players had only 20 days off this summer (eight fewer than recommended) and 13 days of pre-season (15 fewer than recommended), because of their Club World Cup-winning campaign, which added seven matches in the US. Asked about Caicedo after the win over Liverpool, assistant manager Willy Caballero said: ""He has played a lot of games with the Club World Cup and with the national team, so we need to manage him sometimes."" Caicedo has since received his first break from international duty since joining Chelsea. Sources close to him described him as ""exhausted"" in recent weeks. Still, Caicedo takes his international commitments seriously, having helped Ecuador finish second in the South American qualifying group, ahead of Brazil, to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Caicedo, the youngest of 10 siblings, grew up in poverty in Ecuador but has lifted himself and his family out of it through football, becoming a footballing icon back home. In a recent interview in Ecuador, one commentator described Caicedo as ""our [Michael] Jordan.""

A Fiba taskforce was set up in August to investigate ""regulatory non-compliance"" within British basketball. In April, the BBF awarded a 15-year licence to run a new professional men's competition - the Great Britain Basketball League - to GBB League Ltd (GBBL). The BBF said GBBL, a consortium led by the American businessman Marshall Glickman, would provide Â£15m funding in the first two years. However, the existing nine Super League Basketball [SLB] clubs claimed the tender process run by the governing body was ""illegal and unjust"" and refused to join the new league. The clubs launched legal action against the BBF in the high court, while UK sports minister Stephanie Peacock reportedly asked the government body responsible for elite funding, UK Sport, to investigate the allegations. In a statement, Fiba said it had completed a ""comprehensive review of the situation, including interviews and meetings with basketball stakeholders"". Under the terms of the suspension, the BBF will not be permitted to licence or recognise national men's competitions, or field a men's national team in Fiba senior competitions. The taskforce will now ""engage directly with basketball stakeholders and the UK government to explore and propose an interim operational framework for the top-tier men's national competitions"". The statement added: ""These measures aim to restore regulatory integrity and promote sustainable governance of men's basketball in Great Britain as soon as possible.""

fa2cfba7853f,Boycott of Israel gymnasts sets 'dangerous precedent',,"Indonesia has cited their longstanding political and diplomatic principles for their decision. ""We are aware of the Israeli Gymnastics Federation's plan to appeal to Cas. We are anticipating the lawsuit and will face it respectfully, following the rules and regulations of Cas and Indonesia,"" said Youth and Sports Minister Erick Thohir. The decision came from the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, who refused to recognise Israel as a country. That stance has shaped Indonesia's diplomatic posture for decades. During the 1962 Asian Games, Indonesia similarly barred Israeli athletes - leading to its exclusion from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by the International Olympic Committee. Although that ruling was overturned, Indonesia boycotted the Games. In March 2023 Indonesia was stripped of its right to host football's Under-20 World Cup after the governor of Bali, where the draw was due to take place, refused to host the Israel team. Six months later, Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage back to Gaza. Since then more than 67,000 people have been killed by Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures are seen as reliable by the United Nations and other international bodies. More than nine in 10 residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN. Last month the UN commission of inquiry formally declared Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - though Israel rejected this. On Monday, 20 living Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian detainees were reunited with their families as part of a ceasefire deal. Shenar said Indonesia's decision to deny visas to Israeli athletes was ""sad timing"" given the events of the previous day. She added that ""sport and politics should never interfere each other"" as she pointed the finger of blame at FIG, given the IGF had raised the issue with them more than a year ago. ""We were hoping for a diplomatic solution, way before a legal one,"" she added. ""They [FIG] sent us a letter telling us everything is taken under control, that the authorities there gave official letter that they will there will be no problem. ""There is no question who's responsible for this mess in our eyes - FIG, a part of the International Olympic Committee. ""They should be obeying all the rules and not ignoring the Olympic Charter."" In September, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for Israel to be excluded from international sports competitions over its actions in Gaza.

After coming through Wales' age-group teams, she made her senior debut against Switzerland in 2006. Games and goals flowed until, in April 2017, Fishlock became the first Wales footballer, male or female, to win 100 caps, the then 30-year-old marking her milestone with a goal in a 3-1 friendly win over Northern Ireland in Ystrad Mynach. In July 2024 she became her country's leading international goalscorer, claiming her 45th - beating Helen Ward's previous mark - as Wales beat Kosovo 2-0 to seal a seeded spot in the European Championship qualifying play-offs. The crowning point of her career came with Wales qualifying for their first appearance at a major women's tournament, as Rhian Wilkinson's side reached the 2025 European Championship. Although Wales would come away from Switzerland without a win from their three group games, fittingly it was Fishlock who scored their first goal - in the game against France - in the process becoming the oldest scorer in women's Euro finals history aged 38 years and 176 days.

She described him as ""sitting relaxed in a high chair with one arm on the table and his foot on a bench... just staring"". She told prosecution KC Michelle Heeley: ""He was staring towards the bar area. I came out of the kitchen and I noticed him straight away. ""He was just staring through us… like eyes wide open and he just couldn't take his eyes off any of us."" She said she turned a chair so her back was towards him and described how the man didn't interact with many people, adding: ""He was like a loner."" Police were at the station following the incident The next day, after she heard Ms Whyte had been killed, Mrs Brittle said she asked to see a picture of the man who had been arrested. She said: ""I was shown the exact image that I still have in my mind. It was of the person sitting opposite the bar area that night, staring at us all."" Under cross-examination from defence barrister Gurdeep Garcha KC, Mrs Brittle said: ""It was like he was planning something, that's the only way I can describe it. It was really scary, it was like he was going to do something that night. That's how scared I felt."" 'Staring spookily' Mrs Taylor-Bevans, another staff member giving evidence on Wednesday, had started working at the hotel about two weeks earlier. She said Mr Majek had been staring at her, Ms Whyte and another worker, Jamie Leigh Bannister. ""He was staring at all three of us behind the bar, spookily,"" she said, ""like through us – as though we weren't there."" She said after they finished serving crisps and biscuits, she went to reception and told security ""we all felt intimidated"". She said all three went outside to vape when he ""brushed past my arm and knocked Rhiannon's arm"" as they returned to the hotel. Mrs Taylor-Bevans said she looked at Ms Whyte, asking what had happened, and she replied: ""He's just knocked me."" Defending, Mr Garcha asked if it could have been accidental. Mrs Taylor-Bevans said: ""He didn't have to go that close to us...he had loads of space, he was too close to us. ""He was walking closer than he needed to be."" Ms Bannister, who had worked at the hotel for about two years, since before it became an asylum hotel, was on late shift with Ms Whyte. She said: ""We realised all night he was staring directly at all three of us."" The court heard her brother picked her up outside and she went straight home after their shift finished at 23:00 BST. She said Ms Whyte was still in the hotel at that point and seemed ""jolly as always"". She later found out on Facebook her colleague had been attacked. Mr Garcha said Ms Whyte never asked for a lift, adding that none of them were so upset they thought they would need to change plans about getting home.

9e73cc722cb0,Outsourcing firm Capita fined £14m after millions had data stolen,,"The UK's data watchdog has fined outsourcing firm Capita £14m after the personal data of 6.6 million people was stolen in a cyber-attack. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said Capita ""failed to ensure the security of processing of personal data which left it at significant risk"". The fine was originally set at £45m but reduced after discussions between Capita and the watchdog. Capita's boss Adolfo Hernandez said the firm was ""pleased to have concluded this matter and reached today's settlement"". He said the company had ""hugely strengthened"" its cyber-security resilience and was vigilant. Capita provides professional and outsourcing services in a number of different fields for the public and private sectors. It made £2.4bn in revenue last year, according to its latest annual report. After the hack in March 2023, it emerged Capita had left a pool of data unsecured online . Information apparently containing Capita data - including home addresses and passport images - began to circulate on the dark web . The ICO said financial data had been stolen, and in some cases details of criminal records had been hacked. Capita also manages administration for more than 600 pension schemes, and 325 of them were affected. ""Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people,"" said Information Commissioner John Edwards. ""The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place."" The proposed £45m fine was taken down to £14m after Capita argued it had made improvements to its cyber-security, offered support for people affected and engaged with other regulators and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). ""Companies being held financially accountable for data protection failings is a good thing,"" said Trevor Dearing from cyber-security company Illumio. ""It sends a message to the market that regulators are serious and tells victims that their stolen data does matter."" Earlier this year, retailer Co-op was hit by a hack where the details of all of its roughly 6.5m customers was stolen . This came among other high-profile cyber-attacks to M&S, Harrods and Jaguar Land Rover. On Tuesday, the NCSC confirmed there had been an increase in nationally significant attacks this year. It came as the government wrote to bosses around the country advising them to have their contingency plans written down on paper, in case they lose access to their computers in a hack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d6yxdq3d2o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ad18/live/1c2450e0-a9a7-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg,2025-10-15T09:55:32.359000+00:00,2c861ca432ab198adfe41122a974f712038bbabc

Julia Wandelt - who Leicester Crown Court has heard believes she is Madeleine - and Karen Spragg are on trial charged with stalking the missing girl's parents Kate and Gerry McCann. On Wednesday the court was told as part of Miss Wandelt's attempts to make contact and press for a DNA test, David and Fiona Payne were both approached in late 2024. Mrs Payne told the jury that Miss Wandelt's contact - including trying to befriend her daughter on social media - left her ""angry"". PA Media Madeleine McCann's disappearance has never been solved Madeleine's disappearance at the age of three in Portugal in 2007 is one of the most widely reported missing child cases and remains unsolved. Giving evidence, Mr Payne told the court he was sent personal photos of his wife and children by Miss Wandelt. He added he was phoned twice, and then received a series of emails which included photos of Miss Wandelt's grandfather alongside a suspect in the disappearance, and private photos of the Payne and McCann families. Miss Wandelt told him they had been sent to her by someone close to the McCanns who believed that she was Madeleine, the court heard. Mrs Payne, who said she was also phoned and messaged by Miss Wandelt, told the court the couple had received ""unsolicited"" contact over the years from ""all sorts of people"" - from reporters to conspiracy theorists - but the ""disturbing"" attempts to contact them, including friend requests towards the couple's daughter, had left her ""angry"". 'Merry Christmas David' Mr Payne told the jury he took two phone calls from Miss Wandelt in October 2024, which the defendant had recorded. These were played to the jury, with Miss Wandelt asking for him to help her contact the McCanns, saying: ""All doors are closed."" Mr Payne told the jury: ""It's in my nature to help people, but I felt there was nothing I could do."" Mrs Payne said she had been ""half expecting"" Miss Wandelt to call her following this, and when she did that same month, her call was ended by Mrs Payne and her number blocked. Contact continued via a series of messages and emails directed at Mr Payne, including asking him about the McCanns' blood types, about Madeleine's pink toy Cuddle Cat, and a message in December which read: ""Merry Christmas David. The truth will come out."" One message, the court heard, said that as ""part of the tapas group"" - a reference to Mr and Mrs Payne being two of seven people who dined with Kate and Gerry McCann on the night of Madeleine's disappearance - Mr Payne could ""clear"" his family's name by helping Miss Wandelt. One message read: ""Are you scared like me?"" Another said: ""If your daughter who was missing and a girl turned up with compelling evidence what would you do? You can imagine my pain."" The Paynes did not respond to any of the messages, the court heard, with Mr Payne forwarding the texts and emails he had received to police. Mrs Payne said following the opening of the stalking trial, she found a series of messages in her spam folder on Facebook Messenger, which were sent by Miss Wandelt. PA Media Kate and Gerry McCann have given evidence to the trial at Leicester Crown Court In other evidence heard on Wednesday, the senior officer in the Met Police's investigation into Madeleine's disappearance told the trial his team made further inquiries into three women who may have been Madeleine. Twelve leads about specific women were sent in to Operation Grange's public email address, Det Ch Insp Mark Cramwell said, including Miss Wandelt, but three other women were progressed to further action. One person was asked to provide photographic evidence, another was spoken to in person, while a third who had provided a DNA sample independently had their sequence compared to Madeleine's.

862149edf9df,Watchdog urges Phillipson to speed up trans guidance,,"Watchdog urges Phillipson to speed up trans guidance Brian Wheeler Political reporter Getty Images Women and Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson has been urged to speed up her approval of new guidance on the use of single-sex spaces by trans people. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says its new code of practice must be brought into force ""as soon as possible"" because some organisations are using old guidance, which is unlawful. The updated code sets out how gyms, clubs and hospitals must judge certain spaces in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling in April. The watchdog shared the guidance with Phillipson six weeks ago, but it has yet to be implemented. The government says it is taking its time to study the 300 page document. EHRC chairwoman Baroness Falkner has written to Phillipson, who is also education secretary, for the approval process to be speeded up to prevent organisations relying on outdated advice. The revised guidance can only gain legal force after it has been signed off by ministers, and laid in Parliament for 40 days. ""We have been told by some organisations that they intend to continue using this now unlawful code until the revised code is published, therefore allowing practices inconsistent with the law to persist,"" Falkner says in her letter. ""Our updated code of practice accurately reflects the law and is informed by the two public consultations we ran to ensure it is as clear as possible."" Baroness Falkner asked that the current code be revoked ""as soon as possible"" now that Parliament has returned from its party conference recess, so ""that courts, tribunals and duty bearers are clear that it is no longer to be relied on"". Approval of an updated code was ""particularly urgent considering the spread of misinformation and misleading information on the law following the Supreme Court judgment which continues to circulate widely,"" she added. Draft guidance According to the draft EHRC code, a birth certificate could be requested by a sports club or hospital if there is ""genuine concern"" about what biological sex a person is. It also said trans people can be excluded from competitive sport ""when necessary for reasons of safety or fair competition"", and gave an example of how some services might be able to adapt to ""offer toilets in individual lockable rooms to be used by both sexes"". The Conservatives have accused Phillipson, who is running to be Labour's deputy leader, of delaying publication of the guidance to avoid losing support during the contest. Shadow women and equalities minister Mims Davies has accused Phillipson of putting ""her own career opportunities ahead of women's rights"". A source close to Phillipson described claims that the timing of publication was politically motivated as ""utter nonsense"". ""Our only consideration is ensuring this guidance protects the dignity and wellbeing of everyone in society,"" the source added. 'Robust conversation' Thirty two Labour MPs have written to the EHRC urging it to reconsider its draft guidance, which they say will ""open the door to discrimination and harassment against trans people"". Lucy Powell, Phillipson's deputy leadership rival, has said she believes the EHRC guidance goes too far - and has called for MPs to be given a vote on it. Speaking at a fringe event Labour's annual conference last month, Powell said: ""I think we have got some of the language not right on this, and particularly around some of the guidance that's coming forward. ""I really strongly feel like we need a robust and transparent parliamentary conversation about that, because when we're looking at applying the law as parliamentarians, we should have a say on that and that's something I'll be pushing for as well."" A government spokesperson said: ""The government is considering the draft updated code and, if the decision is taken to approve it, the minister will lay it before Parliament. ""The proposed code of practice is over 300 pages long, so it is important that the correct process is followed.""

9a828cb320cd,Baroness Mone-linked PPE firm misses deadline to pay £122m,,"A company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone has failed to meet a deadline to repay £122m for breaching a Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) contract. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) won a legal case earlier this month against PPE Medpro , a consortium led by Lady Mone's husband Doug Barrowman, over claims the PPE did not comply with relevant healthcare standards. A High Court judge ruled some of the company's gowns they supplied were not ""sterile"". Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said the government would ""pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back"" after the company failed to pay the damages cost by 16:00 BST on Wednesday. PPE Medpro entered administration on 30 September, the day before the court judgement. Streeting said: ""At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash. ""PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over £145 million, with interest now accruing daily."" The firm was ordered to pay interest of £23.6m, which means the total sum owed is £145.6m. According to the DHSC, this sum will accrue interest at 8% per year from Thursday until it is fully paid. Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators appointed to take control of the business and recover money owed to creditors, declined to comment. The National Crime Agency (NCA) previously said it was investigating the PPE Medpro case. Mr Barrowman's spokesman had said £83m of the government deal was paid to other companies but it is unclear whether they are being looked at by the NCA. PPE Medpro was awarded a government contract in 2020 to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone. However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract. PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile. According to the company's most recent accounts for the period ending 31 July, the business had £666,025 in net assets. The document filed to Companies House also mentioned how the firm had used about £4.2m in reserves to fight the legal dispute. Since the court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage.

ea053b9b0a86,Morse closes case on £9.6m House of Lords door,,"Morse closes case on £9.6m House of Lords door BBC A report into the construction of a new £9.6m entrance to the House of Lords has identified the errors which led to delays and spiralling costs. In his 15-page review, Lord Morse concluded that a decision to limit building work to times when the House of Lords was not sitting was key factor in the delays. He also said the project had been further postponed by the death of Queen Elizabeth and the subsequent coronation of King Charles, during which time work could not be carried out. The process to upgrade the entrance began in 2023 and had been expected to take 39 weeks at a cost of £6.1m. However, it ended up being delayed by 100 weeks and costs rose by more than £3m. In July, following complaints by peers in the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker asked Lord Morse, a former auditor of government projects, to investigate the reasons behind the delay. In his report, Lord Morse said that in February 2022 the cost of the project had been calculated based on the assumption that building work would ""proceed continuously from start to finish"" and that the entrance would be closed for use. However, the costs were pushed up when, in October 2022, a decision was made that the entrance should be kept open ""at all times"" when the House of Lords was sitting. Lord Morse said the original assumption about the entrance ""proved incorrect and materially increased the cost of delivery"". He said additional costs included a redesign, which had to take place when ground surveys revealed ""unknown voids"" beneath the foundations of the entrance. In September 2022 the project was disrupted following the death of Queen Elizabeth and her subsequent lying-in-state, which took place in Westminster Hall on the parliamentary estate. The construction site was dismantled and work was paused for two weeks. Lord Morse said such disruptions ""might reasonably have been anticipated"" but were ""not directly attributable to the way in which the project was managed"". He said the decision to limit major construction to times when Parliament was not sitting had the largest impact on the delays. The entrance was reopened in December 2024, but immediately ran into problems including power supply issues and difficulties for wheelchair users. In June and July, peers raised concerns in Parliament. Lord Forsyth described the project as ""a complete white elephant and a disaster"" and Leader of the House Baroness Smith of Basildon called the situation ""unacceptable"". Former transport secretary Lord Howell warned that the need for staff to manually operate the door meant Parliament was ""haemorrhaging money"". In his conclusion, Lord Morse said that security had been the ""primary driver"" behind the project. He recommended future projects should be governed by a ""clear framework that recognises the interdependence of security, health and safety, access, value for money and reputation"". Lord Morse also said the project lacked an independent figure, who could balance these priorities and make decisions that were ""in the best interests of Parliament as a whole"". He said future projects should have one single, controlling figure to make such judgements. He suggested that if such a role had existed during the project, the contract stating that work could continue while Parliament was sitting might not have been signed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kpd9lx1j0o,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c03f/live/d69551f0-47b8-11f0-96d7-795fe3aefdde.jpg,2025-10-15T16:11:01.297000+00:00,88b27a0c0f48b1e8e524aaa79d9c001d939c8891
bb90ff52dd02,UN humanitarian chief urges Israel to open more crossings into Gaza,,"The UN humanitarian chief has urged Israel to open more crossings into Gaza to allow a surge of aid, after Israel warned it would limit supplies into the territory over delays from Hamas in releasing the bodies of deceased hostages. Tom Fletcher called on both Israel and Hamas to implement the terms of the ceasefire agreement, saying it was ""essential that we do not squander the immense progress made"" through the US-brokered deal. There has been growing anger in Israel over the delayed return of hostages' bodies, and the key Rafah crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza remained closed on Wednesday. In Gaza, people have been stockpiling food as prices surge over fears the ceasefire may not hold. Humanitarian aid has been entering Gaza since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October, but Israel threatened to restrict supplies after Hamas did not return the bodies of all 28 deceased hostages by Monday, as agreed. Hamas says it has had difficulty locating the remains. So far, seven hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel from Gaza. Hamas said it would return two more bodies later on Wednesday. In a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must ""make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages"". He added: ""As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid - thousands of trucks a week - on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted."" He called for ""more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles"" and said ""withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip"". The Rafah crossing has largely remained closed since fighting broke out after the 7 October 2023 attacks. US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan stipulated that opening the crossing would be ""subject to the same mechanism implemented"" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year. Then, it reopened briefly to allow wounded Palestinians to be evacuated for medical treatment. Meanwhile, an official from Cogat, the Israeli military body in charge of aid for Gaza, said on Tuesday: ""Humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. No such agreement has been reached at any stage."" The UN chief also said he was ""gravely concerned by the evidence of violence against civilians in Gaza"". Reports of masked Hamas gunmen executing eight Palestinians in public have triggered fear and outrage among residents of Gaza. Adm Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, called on Hamas to ""suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza"" in a post on X. He urged the group to seize ""an historic opportunity for peace"" by ""fully standing down, strictly adhering to President Trump's 20-point peace plan and disarming without delay"". Hamas has said it is targeting ""criminals and collaborators with Israel"". Food prices have surged in Gaza as Palestinians stockpile food, concerned that the ceasefire deal will not hold. Traders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC. ""Every time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again,"" says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis. ""I lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I don't trust the ceasefire and we're sick of displacement."" She added that a trader in Khan Younis's main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. ""Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they don't trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop,"" Neven says. Father-of-six Khaled Halas, who lives in Deir al-Balah, said there was ""no water, no electricity and no tents"". Halas was displaced from the Shuja'iyya area of Gaza City and has been forced to move many times. ""The Shuja'iyya [area] is completely closed. I went to the vegetable market where gunfire broke out, we have no protection,"" he said. ""There is constant shooting in our area, and life there is completely destroyed."" The growing unease comes as mediators meet in Egypt in a bid to bridge differences between Hamas and Israel, and keep the first phase of the ceasefire deal on track. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that one of four bodies handed over by Hamas overnight ""does not match any of the hostages"" following examinations at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine.  The other three bodies have been identified as Tamir Nimrodi, 20, Eitan Levy, 53, and Uriel Baruch, 35, the Hostages Families Forum said. The ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday. Under the agreement with Hamas, Israel agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage. Israel has returned the bodies of a further 45 Palestinians , the Hamas-run health ministry confirmed on Wednesday. This brings the total number of bodies released by Israel to 90. The delay in the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages has led to anger in Israel. The son of Amiram Cooper - one of the deceased Israeli hostages whose body is still being held in Gaza - said that he and other hostage relatives are trying ""to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight"". ""It's clear to us that they [Hamas] could have and should have released more and they're playing games,"" Rotem said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c803rmdzjdjo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2087/live/78584840-a9e2-11f0-b2dc-37eb57bf4de6.jpg,2025-10-15T18:31:13.941000+00:00,5a82694a34dc127e7b6cd3bae126f6bb2c6d22b7

Paul Brown , Kayleen Devlin , Erwan Rivault and Barbara Metzler BBC Verify Getty Images As thousands of Gazans made the journey back to their neighbourhoods following the ceasefire, many of them already knew their homes were in ruins. The prospect of rebuilding homes, businesses and all the institutions and services needed for a return to normal life in Gaza is daunting by any measure: the UN estimates that the damage amounts to $70bn . As Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, says: ""It's worse than starting from scratch - here you aren't starting in the sand, you are starting with rubble."" The level of destruction on the strip is ""now in the region of 84%. In certain parts of Gaza, like in Gaza City, it's even up to 92%"", says Jaco Cilliers, UN Development Programme special representative for the Palestinians. This damage has created colossal amounts of rubble. Assessments by BBC Verify based on recent satellite data suggest there could be over 60 million tonnes of debris waiting to be cleared in Gaza. Any process of post-conflict reconstruction must begin by clearing the remnants of war. Clearing the rubble Drone footage shows vast destruction in Gaza City The many millions of tonnes of rubble now littering the Gaza Strip are not just piles of concrete and twisted metal. They also contain human remains and unexploded bombs. ""From a safety and humane perspective, the first thing you have to do is make the sites that have been bombed-out safe,"" says former JCB executive Philip Bouverat. There follows a process of sorting, separation and crushing the debris. After materials like plastic and steel are removed, the remaining concrete can be ground up and reused. This will lay the foundations of construction, but building efforts will require the mass import of materials. ""This isn't going to be done by trucks coming across the border. The first thing we need to do is build a deep-water port, because then you can bring thousands of container-loads in"", Mr Bouverat added. When the sites are cleared, then essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity can be restored, he says. Water and sewerage Clean water is a major immediate need for Gazans. According to estimates from Unicef, more than 70% of the territory's 600 water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October 2023. After the recent announcement of a ceasefire, Israeli soldiers posed in front of a wastewater treatment plant in Gaza City that had been set on fire. The damage came just before Israel's military withdrew from a position near this infrastructure. Wastewater treatment is critical for preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease. Doctors have said Gaza has high rates of diarrhoeal diseases, which can kill children, and a risk of cholera in some areas. In satellite imagery, you can see damage to the bio-towers of the Sheikh Ejleen wastewater treatment plant, which are the main components used for treating sewage. There are six wastewater treatment plants in Gaza. ""All of them are damaged,"" said Maher Najjar, deputy director at Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) which oversees and manages repairs for Gaza's water infrastructure. Since the beginning of the war, repairs have been hugely hampered by the immediate danger from Israeli air and artillery attacks and a shortage of tools, he said. Some facilities have been attacked again after being repaired. The IDF said its actions are ""based on military necessity and with accordance to international law"", as it tries to prevent Hamas ""threatening the citizens of Israel"". Alongside facilities that treat sewage, Gaza has separate plants that provide clean drinking water and which have also experienced major damage. Satellite images from April 2024 show a seawater desalination plant which supplied northern Gaza and Gaza City still intact. But by early May, it had been destroyed. ""We are talking about damaged water wells, damaged networks, reservoirs, carrier lines. It's very hard to know where to start. To begin with we need at least $50m to return around 20% of the services to the population,"" Mr Najjar said. ""The total loss is around $1bn, maybe more."" Housing Satellite images show the devastation in an area of Sheikh Radwan, a neighbourhood in the north-east of Gaza City. In August before the IDF occupied the city, which it called the ""last stronghold"" of Hamas, many streets appeared largely intact. By last week, whole swathes of the neighbourhood had been flattened as the IDF established a base. Over the course of the war, the UN's satellite centre Unosat estimates a total of 282,904 houses and apartments across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. But these figures are likely to be an underestimate, because they do not yet include the recent military operations in Gaza City, such as the destruction in Sheikh Radwan. The chart below shows how the rate of housing damage increased sharply in the middle of 2024 - coinciding with IDF operations in Rafah, which left much of the city in ruins. Another significant spike is likely to have occurred as a result of the Gaza City occupation. Gaza City's Hamas-run Municipality has said that 90% of its roads have also been damaged. According to Shelly Culbertson, a senior policy researcher at the Washington-based think tank, RAND Corporation, the rebuilding of Gaza's housing ""could take decades."" ""After the Israeli bombing of Gaza in 2014 and 2021 reconstruction of housing was slow because Israel wouldn't allow in a lot of construction materials because they had dual-use purposes,"" she said. ""If you rebuild now the way they did in 2014 and 2021 it will take 80 years. If there's good planning, it could take less time,"" she said. ""Good planning is designing camps that can turn into neighbourhoods and helping people move back into and rebuild damaged homes."" Power Gaza's power system was under strain before the current war. Rolling blackouts were frequent, and most Gazans lived on limited hours of electricity each day. Historically, most of Gaza's electricity supply comes from power lines connecting it to Israel and the diesel-fired Gaza Power Plant, with some rooftop and public-facility solar panels added in recent years. Since 11 October 2023, Gaza has experienced a near-total electricity blackout after Israel cut external electricity. One exception was a direct feed to the South Gaza desalination plant, which supplies clean drinking water. Israel reconnected its feed to this plant on 14 November 2024 and then cut it again on 9 March 2025, before reconnecting it once more. The Gaza Power Plant has been inoperable due to a lack of fuel, and solar facilities have suffered widespread damage. With the grid largely down, essential services have depended on limited diesel generators and the remaining solar panels. Getty Images Solar panels provide power for these families living in tents near Gaza City A joint assessment from earlier this year by the World Bank, European Union and UN estimated that more than 80% of power generation and distribution assets have either been destroyed or are non-operational since the start of the war, at an estimated cost in damages of more than $494m. Gaza Electricity Distribution Cooperation (Gedco), the company responsible for managing electricity supply across the Gaza Strip, say 70% of its buildings and facilities have been destroyed since October 2023. At the end of last month, we verified video of the company's headquarters being struck. In a statement following the event, Gedco said the attack had ""directly affected the company's ability to manage its administrative and technical businesses"". Agriculture The satellite image below of one area east of Jabalia shows how 4 sq km of crops - likely olive and citrus trees - were wiped out over the course of the war. Running through the razed ground is a road or track established by the IDF, probably to provide access to northern areas of nearby Gaza City. Analysis by Prof He Yin of Kent State University found that across the Gaza Strip, 82.4% of annual crops and more than 97% of tree crops were likely to have suffered damage during the war up to 10 August this year. The decline of agriculture, coupled with prolonged restrictions on aid, drove severe food insecurity throughout the conflict, culminating in a famine declaration in Gaza City in September. Unosat attributes this decline to the ""impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict related dynamics"". Mr Bouverat says that in order for agriculture to recover, the land needs to be cleared of unexploded bombs, shells and mines ""pretty urgently"". ""If they can grow their own crops, they can feed themselves, and the sooner we do that the better,"" he says. Education About half of Gaza's population before the war was aged under 18, so rebuilding schools is essential for any return to normal life. School buildings became shelters for displaced Palestinians throughout the conflict, and were frequently targeted by IDF forces with the justification that they housed ""command and control"" centres for Hamas and affiliated groups. The UN relief agency for Palestine, Unrwa, which once operated 288 schools in Gaza, says 91.8% of all of school buildings will require ""full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again"". Higher education institutions have also not been spared. For example, in December 2023, the al-Azhar University to the south of Gaza City was blown up by Israeli troops. The site is now part of the Netzarim Corridor, one of several miilitarised zones established by the IDF over the course of the war. The same fate befell the Israa University less than 2km away. which was demolished by IDF troops after serving as a temporary base for several weeks.

b6390310a331,Ukraine imposes blackouts in most regions after Russian power grid attacks,,"Ukraine imposes blackouts in most regions after Russian power grid attacks Laura Gozzi and Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Russian missile and drone attacks have knocked out power in regions across Ukraine Emergency power outages have been brought in across almost all of Ukraine after a intensive campaign of Russian air strikes on energy infrastructure. This will be the fourth consecutive winter of blackouts throughout Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The energy ministry said all but two regions were affected. Only the eastern Donetsk region at the forefront of the war is exempt, while the northern Chernihiv region is already facing hourly outages. As well as targeting the power network, Russia has increasingly targeted Ukraine's railways. Ukraine has meanwhile ramped up attacks on Russian oil refineries, in border regions and beyond. One oil depot in the Crimean peninsula - which Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 - has been burning for three days following a second Ukrainian drone attack in a week. The Marine Oil Terminal in Feodosia is the largest in Crimea and an important logistical link for Russian troops operating in Ukraine. Telegram channel Supernova+ Images of the fire at Feodosia were posted on Ukrainian Telegram channels Kyiv's armed forces general staff said on Wednesday that 16 fuel tanks were damaged and that a large-scale blaze was continuing to burn. The surge in drone attacks on oil refineries and pipelines has also led to fuel shortages and price rises in some parts of Russia - a development that Ukrainian leaders hope will hit Russia's war effort and help bring the Kremlin to the negotiating table. The strikes have reduced Russian fuel exports to their lowest level since the start of the war, according to figures from the International Energy Agency. Ukraine's energy ministry said emergency restrictions were being brought in ""because of the complicated situation"". Emergency work was taking place in all regions affected by Russian attack, grid operator Ukrenergo said, and it urged consumers who still had power to use it sparingly. Temperatures in parts of Ukraine were forecast to fall to 3C overnight into Thursday. The electricity company in Lviv in western Ukraine said that because the outages were under emergency conditions there was no possibility to warn consumers in advance. Reuters Power outages have increased in recent weeks because of Russia's campaign of air strikes Russia argues its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are aimed at its military, but millions of civilians have already been affected by outages in recent weeks. On one night alone last week, on 9-10 October, a combined missile and drone attack caused power cuts in nine regions, from Kharkiv and Sumy in the north to Odesa in the south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of aiming to ""create chaos and apply psychological pressure on the population through strikes on energy facilities and railways"". Kyiv has long been pushing to be given more weapons that could allow it to strike deeper into Russia, and Zelensky this week vowed that long-range weapons would be used only on military targets, not civilians. Ukraine's Western allies have been wary of providing long-range weaons through concern such a move would escalate the war. Moscow has repeatedly said it would view the use of Western-made weapons to hit Russia as ""direct participation"" of Nato countries in the war in Ukraine. However, Moscow's ""red line"" on Western missiles has already been crossed without any clear consequences. US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spoken of his impatience with Russia's failure to move towards ending the war, has said he is considering supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles. He is due to meet Zelensky in the US on Friday. At a Nato summit on Wednesday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the US and its allies would ""impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression"" if the war in Ukraine did not come to an end. The US stood ready to do its part ""in ways that only the United States can do,"" Hegseth said, without elaborating further. He also encouraged Nato countries to contribute to the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (Purl) programme under which allies buy US-made weapons that are then sent on to Ukraine. Several countries have already said they would take part in Purl. Germany on Wednesday said it would spend $500m (£374m) on weaponry for Ukraine, while the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have collectively pledged $1bn. Kyiv remains dependent on Western arms donations to push back Russian troops, although it has been developing its own defence industry.

6e328848f89d,War crimes alert as food runs out in besieged Sudan city,,"War crimes alert as food runs out in besieged Sudan city Reuters Residents have dug shelters next to buildings to try and shield themselves during the bombardments Satellite images show how Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is flouting international law by intentionally targeting civilians in the besieged city of el-Fasher - actions that should be considered war crimes, a research team from Yale University says. ""We're looking at the growth of an entire new burial area with over 60 new mounds that have been built in just a two-week period,"" Caitlin Howarth, from the university's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), told the BBC. People are now completely trapped with no hope of escape as the RSF recently completed a 57km (35-mile) earthen wall around the city. Desperate residents in the army's last stronghold in Darfur say food has run out. ""There is nothing left to eat today - all food supplies have run out,"" the resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Even the alternatives that people clung to for survival have disappeared,"" it said, referring to ""ambaz"", a residue of peanuts after oil has been extracted, which is normally fed to animals. AFP/Getty Images The RSF has its origins in the notorious Janjaweed militia accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the region's non-Arab population Sudan plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between the military and the RSF. Since the conflict erupted, RSF fighters and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups. El-Fasher came under siege 18 months ago and a communications blackout makes it difficult to confirm information from the city as only those with satellite internet connections are contactable. The resistance committee warned that time was running out for the estimated 300,000 people who still live in the city. ""We write, we scream, we plead; but it seems our words fall into a void,"" it said. ""There are no aid planes, no humanitarian airlifts, no real international movement and no ground efforts to break the siege."" Community kitchens have had to stop providing meals to people seeking refuge in shelters, traders inside the city told the Sudan Tribune news website. They added that all food goods had completely disappeared even from shops, which used to get smuggled stock to sell at exorbitant prices. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies Analysis of satellite imagery of Daraja Oula neighbourhood from 26 September (left) and 10 October 2025 (right) shows a recently established gravesite in the Daraja Oula neighbourhood had increased by approximately 60 mounds Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies These close-ups near the Saudi Hospital show the damage to a roof from a munitions attack - the one of the left is from 26 September and on the right taken on 10 October. This is one of multiple buildings targeted in this area Ms Howarth told the BBC's Newsday programme that in the last few months civilians had been driven by the RSF from the displacement camps around el-Fasher and other neighbourhoods by arson and in some cases by what looked like ""house-to-house clearance operations"". They were now in their last places of refuge in ""increasingly smaller zones"", concentrated in shelters at mosques, near hospitals and markets - areas that were undergoing repeated bombardment. Satellite images showed ""burn scars"" where specific buildings had been targeted with ""horrific"" results, according to Ms Howarth. ""We had air-deployed munitions - this could be a combination of drone and artillery that came in… through the roofs, exploding on impact and then burning everything that was within those structures,"" she explained, adding that ground sources had told them the people inside had been ""burned alive"". The Yale HRL researchers found that over the last month attacks included those on two shelters, one of which was also a community kitchen, two mosques, one hospital and one market - killing at least 174 people and wounding at least 123 people. ""These incidents include only those that HRL corroborated through either remote sensing, open source documentation, or a combination of both methods and are likely an undercount,"" its report said . ""These actions are prima facie war crimes and may rise to the level of crimes against humanity."" The researchers also identified that between 26 September and 10 October, at least 60 burial mounds were created in a new cemetery in the Daraja Oula neighbourhood, one of the only areas still under the control of the army and their allies, local armed groups known as the Joint Forces. Ms Howarth said there were now only four RSF-controlled exits out of the city. ""There should be calls for the immediate cessation of these hostilities, for civilians to be allowed to immediately and safely depart el-Fasher without harassment, without taxation, without the risk of extrajudicial execution,"" she said. ""And aid and humanitarian aid access should be allowed completely in without any threat of bombardment or attack.""

f8dfc4a2be55,Health minister defends timeline on dealing with winter pressures,,"Health minister defends timeline on dealing with winter pressures Lyndsey Telford BBC News NI BBC Health minister Mike Nesbitt said he was determined to get the plan out ahead of last years plan, which was published in November. The health minister has defended his department's timeline for initiating a plan to deal with winter pressures on the health service. Mike Nesbitt said a plan has been developed but has not yet been finalised and will be published on Thursday. It comes in response to comments made by Alliance MLA Nuala McAllister , over what she described as a ""shocking"" lack of information on how winter pressures will be managed. Meanwhile, speaking at a conference on Wednesday morning, Nesbitt hailed ""quite remarkable success"" in a recent drop on outpatient waiting lists. PA Media Health committee member Nuala McAllister said information provided to the  committee to date had been ""inadequate"" and lacking in detail McAllister said assembly members had been raising the issue of the department's winter preparedness plan since January, but that nothing had yet been published. She said information provided to the health committee to date had been ""inadequate"" and lacking in detail, despite the service already facing pressures. BBC News NI has seen a leaked presentation paper entitled The Big Discussion from the Department of Health, which it is understood will be presented to Stormont's health committee on Thursday. The document outlines pressures on the health service and points to areas that need improvement. The Department of Health said the document was not its winter preparedness plan,  but rather one of a number of documents which were never intended to be action specific, and which ""formed part of the extensive discussion and practical work which has been taking place across the health and social care system"". It added that it had already mobilised an extensive vaccination programme, to minimise the impact from winter infections such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Covid-19. Unpublished winter plan 'not acceptable' McAllister said that the minister and the department ""have not brought any information on what exactly they are doing to better prepare hospitals and staff for the pressures they are already facing"". She added it was ""not acceptable"" that a winter preparedness plan had not already been published, and that she understood the health sector was not happy either. She also described the inadequate level of information given to the health committee as ""shocking"". However speaking on Wednesday, the minister said: ""We are in mid-October, I am determined to get it out ahead of last years plan, which was published in November."" Admitting that pressures on the health service were ""bad"" last year, the minister said the reason the plan has not yet been published is due to ""operational delivery"". ""There is not a final signed-off plan, and the reason for that is all of the operational delivery will be performed by the five geographically defined health and social care trusts, they have to input their plans into our overall master plan,"" he said. Getty Images Dr Alan Stout, who chairs the British Medical Association's Northern Ireland council, said he was ""exceptionally worried"" about this winter 'Embarrassed' Speaking at the Northern Ireland Confederation for Health and Social Care (NICON) conference on Wednesday morning, Nesbitt referenced new figures which outline a fall in the number of people waiting more than four years for an outpatient appointment in Northern Ireland. He said the figure has fallen by almost a quarter, which is equivalent to 24,811 fewer patients. Over the same period, he said, the number of people waiting more than four years for treatment reduced by 33%, a fall of 6,683 patients. He said that ahead of the winter preparedness plan being published, the drop in waiting lists ""will hopefully help"". However, McAllister said she would be ""embarrassed"" if she was the Department of Health attending Stormont's health committee on Thursday. ""It's too late now, moving forward, we have to make sure that it works, because we can't see the same scenes every single year where our medical staff are put under immense pressure, but patient outcomes are poor, something has got to change.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgk98lzn32o,Health,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2429/live/6a2102e0-a9d2-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg,2025-10-15T12:21:13.743000+00:00,54c87036f1f1b08891190e5fffc654365be8a473
a6847f2431f3,Rain rescues England from shock defeat against Pakistan,,"England avoided a shock defeat by Pakistan at the Women's World Cup, being saved by heavy rain in Colombo. An inspired bowling performance from Pakistan saw England slump to 79-7 after 25 overs before the first heavy downpour began. After a lengthy delay, the rain eased and play resumed at 31 overs per side, with England posting 133-9 after a useful stand of 47 between Charlie Dean, who top-scored with 33, and Em Arlott. Pakistan were set a revised target of 113 and made a promising start by reaching 34-0 before the rain resumed and denied them a historic victory, which would have been their first one-day international win over England. It was a fortunate escape for England who suffered their second batting scare of the tournament, after they recovered from 78-5 to beat Bangladesh, and a big wake-up call before their toughest challenges against India and Australia which come next. Nat Sciver-Brunt's side were outplayed by Pakistan, who are winless in the tournament so far, as five wickets fell in the powerplay, including another failure for the opening partnership. Tammy Beaumont was the first to fall, bowled after leaving a superb delivery from Diana Baig which nipped back sharply. Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana then starred with three wickets, bowling Amy Jones for eight, before claiming the two vital scalps of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight, bowled and lbw for four and 18 respectively. Without their two most experienced players, England were exposed and caught between attack and defence. Sophia Dunkley and Alice Capsey were lbw sweeping and Emma Lamb's struggles at number six continued as she was bowled by spinner Sadia Iqbal for four. Capsey and Charlie Dean withstood Pakistan's array of spinners for 70 balls but only added 21 runs before the pressure told on the former, but Dean was proactive once play resumed by adding valuable runs with Arlott. Pakistan openers Omaima Sohail and Muneeba Ali were confident at the beginning of their reply and England were sloppy with the ball, but it is another heartbreak for them having reduced defending champions Australia to 76-7 before that game also slipped from their grasp . England now travel to Indore to face India and Australia before they conclude the group stage against New Zealand in Visakhapatnam, where flatter pitches are expected at both venues.

Yet for some time this season there very much was doubt about who would be driving for the former champions next season. The spectre of Max Verstappen has hung heavily over both Mercedes drivers for a fair portion of this season - and Russell more so than Antonelli. Wolff said at the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season that a move for Verstappen was ""not on any radar"". But it was a statement that reflected Wolff's acceptance that the prospects of attracting Verstappen were relatively distant, and was aimed at deflecting disruptive questions. It did not change the fact that Wolff was interested in Verstappen, and everybody in F1 knew it. Wolff tried to get the Dutchman last year, before eventually admitting defeat. And they had talks again this season. It was Russell who explicitly spelled out what was happening, at the Austrian Grand Prix at the end of June. ""It's only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing,"" Russell said. ""But from my side, if I'm performing as I'm doing, what have I got to be concerned about? There are two seats in every Formula 1 team."" That was a reference to Russell's emphatic victory in the previous race in Canada, and to the fact that the Briton was already by that point not only having arguably his best season in F1, but comfortably outperforming his highly touted rookie team-mate.

5299409f4226,How are World Cup favourites shaping up - and who will win?,,"England have booked their place at the 2026 World Cup and so attention turns to how they might fare in North America next summer - and how some of their rivals are looking.

Thomas Tuchel's contract runs to the end of the tournament and the feeling has been that England have gone all out to get to this point.

Yet Tuchel believes England will be ""underdogs"" at the World Cup ""because we haven't won it for decades"".

Argentina and Brazil, who have both qualified, will hope the location gives them a boost.

Seven of the eight World Cups set in the Americas have been won by a South American team.

And 10 of the 11 World Cups held in Europe have been won by European teams.

BBC Sport looks at how some of the World Cup favourites are shaping up.

Spain are the early bookmakers' favourites to win the World Cup - and with good reason.

They were deserved winners at Euro 2024, beating England in the final.

And in teenage Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal they have one of the best players in the world.

Not counting a penalty shootout defeat in June's Nations League final against Portugal, they have not lost a competitive game since facing Scotland in March 2023.

They have not yet qualified although sit top of Group E on maximum points.

France, still managed by Didier Deschamps - who took charge in 2012 but will step down after the tournament - are aiming to reach their third World Cup final in a row.

They beat Croatia in 2018 before losing to Argentina on penalties after a 3-3 draw in probably the greatest ever final in 2022.

Key to their hopes will be Kylian Mbappe, who has hit 17 goals in 13 matches for Real Madrid and France this season.

They top Group D by three points over Ukraine, following Monday's frustrating 2-2 draw with Iceland.

There is a real hope this could be England's year after several near misses under Gareth Southgate.

The fact the Football Association appointed the highly-decorated German on a deal just for this tournament shows how focused they are on their bid to win it.

And fortunately for Tuchel, he has a fully-firing Harry Kane. The 32-year-old has bagged 20 goals in 11 matches for Bayern Munich and England.

England are the only European team who have won nine of their past 10 games, and the first to qualify for the tournament next summer.

Brazil used to be the country most synonymous with World Cup glory, lifting their fifth trophy in 2002.

But they have not reached any of the five finals since then.

And so they made a bold move and brought in serial winner Carlo Ancelotti as their first foreign head coach since 1965.

He took over in May after Dorival Junior was sacked following a 4-1 loss to arch-rivals Argentina in World Cup qualifying.

Brazil ended up qualifying in fifth place in the South American group, with six defeats from 18 games, so they are far from flying.

Argentina are the defending champions, beating France on penalties in the last World Cup final in Qatar.

And they won the South American qualifying group by some way, finishing nine points above second-placed Ecuador.

All-time footballing great Lionel Messi has not yet committed to playing in the World Cup - but it would be a major surprise if he did not.

However, the 38-year-old was rested for a recent friendly because boss Lionel Scaloni wanted to see Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez play together.

Portugal are yet to qualify for the World Cup but will be confident of their chances as they are running away with Group F, despite drawing with Hungary on Tuesday.

There was a feeling at Euro 2024 that national great Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time leading goalscorer in international football, was holding them back.

But since then Ronaldo - who will be 41 by next summer - has scored 13 goals in 13 games for Portugal.

Portugal look in good shape and won the Nations League final on penalties against Spain in the summer.

Germany will have to drastically improve on recent major tournaments if they are to challenge in North America.

Since winning the 2014 World Cup they have gone out in the group stage twice and failed to get beyond the quarter-finals of a European Championship.

And they are making hard work of even reaching the World Cup, sitting above Slovakia only on goal difference in Group A.

They lost last month to Slovakia in only their fourth World Cup qualifying defeat.

The Netherlands are in good form and have only lost once since England beat them in the Euro 2024 semi-final.

In qualifying they have 16 points from six games - with 22 goals scored and only three conceded.

In this qualifying campaign, Memphis Depay has become the country's all-time leading goalscorer (54) and assist producer (35).

It feels customary to put Italy in an article on World Cup favourites - but the data does not back it up.

Since winning the 2006 World Cup they have failed to play in one single knockout game.

They exited the groups in 2010 and 2014 and then failed to even reach the next two World Cups.

And that could yet be three in a row as they sit three points behind Group I leaders Norway and may well need the play-offs.

18e6a6e894c8,What does xG tell us about how Premier League teams have started the season?,,"Both Manchester United and Chelsea have one of the top five attacks in the league but worryingly also rank in the bottom five defensively. Liverpool's back-to-back defeats following five straight wins gives a more accurate picture of how they have been playing, while Tottenham have needed to be very efficient to make up for their lack of dominance in games. Aston Villa's early-season struggles are no longer to do with finishing - they have now scored six non-penalty goals from an xG of 6.0 - but simply because they have not been playing well. While promoted sides Leeds and Sunderland have adapted quite well to the top-flight, Burnley have struggled to make the jump so far with both the worst attack and the worst defence. Looking at teams' attacks specifically in the next graphic, United, Arsenal and Liverpool have taken by far the most shots, averaging around 15 per game. But the reason why City and Crystal Palace have the best attacks overall is because they are creating much better chances, averaging around 0.14 xG per shot. What that means is that historically Premier League sides have converted the chances City and Palace are creating at a rate of 14%, compared to 10% of the shots that United, Arsenal and Liverpool are.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7v865zz3n5o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/fcb0/live/3d869a80-a8f9-11f0-a33c-d7bc21b91844.jpg,2025-10-15T15:10:06.529000+00:00,96d643c281963993054ef0cbe856d0049aa99b0e

The 18-year-old was in superb form, hitting 10 180s and producing an average of 110.73 as he defeated Dutchman Dennie Olde Kalter 8-2 in the final at Robin Park Leisure Centre in Wigan. ""I'm really happy to come away with a win,"" said Littler, who averaged 102 across his seven matches on Wednesday. ""At the start of the day it was just about getting through the early stages, and you need to believe in yourself."" On his way to the final, Littler beat Dylan Slevin 6-4, Jeffrey de Graaf 6-4, Adam Lipscombe 6-0, Adam Hunt 6-4 and Rhys Griffin 6-3, before averaging more than 109 in a 7-4 semi-final victory over world number four Stephen Bunting. Olde Kalter, 33, is in his first season on the PDC Tour after winning a spot via Q School and is ranked 140th in the world.

762f72d44e40,Players 'misunderstood' over exhibition criticisms,,"World number one Carlos Alcaraz says players are misunderstood when they want to play in exhibition tournaments alongside the demanding tennis calendar. Alcaraz, 22, was among those critical of the workload in Asia, where some players struggled physically, with the Spaniard saying he would consider skipping mandatory events to prioritise his health. He is top seed at this week's lucrative Six Kings Slam in Saudi Arabia , a six-man tournament from 15 to 18 October that also includes Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz and Stefanos Tsitsipas. There is a reported $4.5m (Â£3.4m) in prize money on offer at the exhibition, with some players also likely to have been paid seven-figure sums to appear. Reports say the winner could take home up to $6m (Â£4.5m). But Alcaraz feels that shorter-format events such as the Six Kings Slam are less gruelling than tour competitions, and therefore make fewer demands on the players. He said: ""A lot of players are talking about the calendar, how tight it is with a lot of tournaments, tournaments of two weeks, and then making excuses with exhibitions. ""It's a different format, different situation playing exhibitions than the official tournaments, 15, 16 days in row, having such a high focus and demanding physically. ""We're just having fun for one or two days and playing some tennis, and that's great, and why we choose the exhibitions. ""I understand [the criticism], but sometimes people don't understand us, our opinions. It's not really demanding mentally [compared with] when we're having such long events like two weeks or two and a half weeks."" Alcaraz won his eighth title of the season in Tokyo last month despite an ankle injury sustained in his opening match that prompted him to pull out of the Shanghai Masters. He will play in Saudi Arabia despite the injury not being fully healed. ""Everything's OK,"" said Alcaraz. ""I've been recovering the ankle as much as I can. ""I don't feel 100% - the doubts are there when I'm moving on court, but it improved a lot and I'm going to compete and perform well in the Six Kings Slam.""

Pulev, the WBA's 'Regular' champion, was ordered to defend his belt against the 20-year-old rising star. Team Itauma has been considering a fight for the Englishman in December, with Derek Chisora suggesting he would share a card with Itauma on 13 December in Manchester. ""We've had several top heavyweights already turn down a fight with Moses but if Pulev fancies the job now that it's been ordered we will absolutely be pursuing it. It's a brilliant fight,"" Warren told BBC Sport. Itauma last fought in August when he blew former world title challenger Dillian Whyte away in one round. The result improved Itauma's undefeated record to 13 fights and eleven knockouts. Itauma has since been linked with a slew of potential opponents including Filip Hrgovic, Michael Hunter and domestic rival David Adeleye. Warren is keen to give Itauma more rounds as the youngster only has 26 rounds under his belt so far. Pulev is a veteran of the sport at the age of 44, with 35 fights on his record. The Bulgarian has twice challenged for world titles, losing to Anthony Joshua in 2020 and Wladimir Klitschko in 2014. Queensberry boss Warren has cooled talk of an imminent fight with the likes of Oleksandr Usyk, but says Itauma ""is already one of the best heavyweights in world boxing"". ""Our job is to make the right fights for him at the right time,"" Warren said. ""I've been in boxing 47 years and at his age, 20 years of age, he is the best young talent at that age that I've ever been involved with, and I've been involved with 99% of the top British fighters and other fighters from around the world.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cy8v92edg4lo,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/a699/live/02302870-a9e9-11f0-8f02-15a9bbd0334e.jpg,2025-10-15T17:47:33.022000+00:00,b2fb586a60e42e0dd50a41e60c1fa1eb2a4cb500

The Italian was shown a second yellow card of the game by referee Anthony Taylor for leaving the technical area to celebrate with his players following Estevao Willian's 95th-minute winner against the reigning champions this month. ""It was alleged that the manager acted in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour during the fixture, which led to his dismissal around the 96th minute,"" the Football Association said. The FA said Maresca admitted the charge and accepted the standard penalty. Maresca, who was shown a yellow card for dissent earlier in the game at Stamford Bridge, has also been fined Â£8,000. It means he will not be in the Chelsea dugout when the Blues travel to the City Ground to face Ange Postecoglou's Nottingham Forest on Saturday, with assistant coach Willy Caballero expected to deputise for the former Leicester City boss.

91d39d7c2875,Pacquiao 'can be looked at' for Crocker - Conlan,,"Although that option is viable, it is much more likely Crocker will either face Benn or enjoy another big night in Belfast for a first voluntary defence. However, much will depend on the outcome of November's middleweight rematch between Benn and Chris Eubank Jr in terms of when Benn could be ready to return to the ring and drop back to welterweight. The updated IBF rankings have former light-welterweight champion Liam Paro in the number two position with Donovan, who is understood to be appealing September's decision at Windsor Park, in third. A successful outcome for Donovan would most likely see him retain his high ranking and secure a final eliminator against Paro for the mandatory slot. ""Benn is the fight Crocker wants and he is confident he will beat him,"" Conlan confirmed. ""That's all well and good and the numbers are exciting, but you are putting Lewis' livelihood on hold in hope of what will happen in another fight [Eubank-Benn II] and it doesn't work like that, so get something booked for Belfast and most likely that's what will happen next. If they [Matchroom] control the situation with the mandatory, then it can be pushed off and we can do Benn [after a first voluntary]. ""There are still a few moving parts to happen, but I think Paro will fight Donovan or Karen Chukhadzhian next. ""Donovan's team have appealed so his ranking hasn't moved. That could be good news for 'Croc' as his mandatory will be kept on the long finger if Paro is out in the early part of next year.

8c5a88bce803,Syria's Sharaa meets Putin in Moscow for first time since fall of Assad,,"Syria's interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has held his first talks with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow since ousting Russia's ally Bashar al-Assad 10 months ago. Putin spoke of the ""special relationship"" between both countries. Sharaa suggested he would continue to allow Russia access to its military bases in Syria. He was also expected to ask for the extradition of Assad, who was granted asylum after fleeing to Moscow. For years they were enemies, on opposing sides of a bloody civil war. Putin used brutal military force to prop up Bashar al-Assad. And Sharaa's armed Islamist group led the rebel offensive that eventually forced Assad from power. But on Wednesday, the Russian and Syrian leaders sat down together for the first time, putting pragmatism ahead of past enmity. ""Over the past decades, our countries have built a special relationship,"" Putin said. He added that there were ""quite a few interesting and useful undertakings"" on the agenda of their talks, and that Russia stood ready to ""do everything to fulfil them"". Sharaa said he wanted Syria to re-establish its relations with all countries, but ""chiefly with Russia"". ""We are trying to restore and redefine in a new way the nature of these relations so there is independence for Syria, sovereign Syria, and also its territorial unity and integrity and its security stability."" They were warm words from two men seeking a good working relationship. Russia wants continued access to its Tartous naval port and Hmeimim military airbase on Syria's Mediterranean coast. Sharaa suggested he would allow this, saying Syria would ""respect all agreements concluded throughout the great history"" of their bilateral relations. In turn, he wants help to consolidate his power in Syria, secure its borders and rescue a parlous economy with access to Russian energy and investment. Russian ministers said they were ready to deliver foodstuffs and medication to Syria, and to help repair damaged power and transport infrastructure. But amid the smiles, tensions remain. Syrian sources said Sharaa would ask for Assad to be extradited so the exiled leader could face trial for war crimes. It is thought unlikely Russia would agree. On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia had granted asylum to Assad because he and his family had ""faced the risk of physical elimination"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201p2dd6r4o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/39a0/live/37e51a30-a9ed-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-15T19:08:54.321000+00:00,2d599ff5f8e6ee5bce196b722a79fee8f2e6fb33
2d6d1507ae09,England's lucky escape - what are the problems to address?,,"England travel to Indore for their next two games to take on their toughest opponents in India, on Sunday, and Australia on 22 October. Neither are ideal opponents to be facing with batting fragilities to address but the pitches there are expected to be flatter and friendlier to batters. It was Knight's gritty determination which rescued them against Bangladesh and Sciver-Brunt's class ensured they posted a winning total against Sri Lanka, but when both fell early against Pakistan, England could not recover. ""Nat Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight have scored more runs between them than their team-mates combined at this tournament,"" World Cup winner Alex Hartley said on BBC Test Match Special. ""That says something within itself, and neither of them batted in the first match. That is a concern."" Beaumont and Jones have struggled against the swinging ball - stands of six, 24 and 13 following the chase of just 70 in the opener against South Africa - but Charlotte Edwards' first move in charge was to show faith and re-promote Jones, and it feels unlikely she will disrupt the pair. After Sciver-Brunt and Knight, England's next best batter has been number eight Charlie Dean with a steady 27 not out in a tense chase against Bangladesh, a handy 19 against Sri Lanka and she top-scored with 33 against Pakistan. There have been glimpses of promise from Alice Capsey at seven but Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lamb are struggling to start their innings against spin in the middle order. Lamb has 18 runs in three innings while Dunkley has 29, each of their dismissals to spin, with the former being asked to play an unfamiliar role. When batting in the top three in domestic and international cricket, Lamb averages 44 in 61 innings with five centuries.

Upon returning to Bristol, she was named Women's Super League (WSL) Players' Player of the Season in her second campaign and enjoyed even more success in Australia soon after. Having joined Melbourne Victory, Fishlock starred as the Victoria-based side reached two Grand Finals - winning their first title in 2013. An eye-catching move to Seattle Reign in 2013 proved to be the catalyst in making Fishlock a star on the global stage. She has helped the club win three NWSL Shield titles, and even during her loan stints away from the American side, of which there have been six in total, success still followed. Indeed, the midfielder tasted further league glory with Glasgow, Melbourne City, Frankfurt and Lyon - winning the Champions League with each of the latter two sides. But the glut of honours were never replicated on the international stage. Fishlock wasted no time in becoming a key cog under Andy Beattie, Adrian Tucker, Jarmo Matikainen, Jayne Ludlow, Gemma Grainger and most recently Wilkinson. Though for all of her mesmerising showings, goals, assists and endeavour, tournament qualification proved one hurdle too many with Wales for the majority of her career.

7a57e2a0ee19,Hamas returns two more bodies but says it cannot retrieve remaining dead hostages,,"Hamas says it has handed over the bodies of two more Israeli hostages under the terms of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, but says it needs time and specialised equipment to recover the rest of the deceased from the ruins of Gaza The group's armed wing said in a statement it was committed to the deal but had returned all the bodies of hostages it was able to reach. US President Donald Trump has said Israeli forces could resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas does not uphold the agreement. In a statement, the Israeli PM's office said Israel had received - through the Red Cross - coffins containing the bodies of hostages which were now awaiting official identification. ""The IDF urges the public to act with sensitivity and wait for official identification, which will first be communicated to the families of the deceased hostages,"" the statement said. If the two bodies returned on Wednesday night are confirmed to be hostages, that would mean 19 are still unaccounted for in Gaza. Hamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan. But Hamas's armed wing said in a statement ""the remaining bodies require significant efforts and specialised equipment to search for and retrieve, and we are making a great effort to close this file"". Earlier, Israel said it would ""not compromise"" on hostage returns, saying ""the mission is not complete"". Israel's defence minister said he had instructed the IDF to prepare a ""comprehensive plan"" to defeat Hamas in Gaza in the event of a renewal of the war. After meeting senior generals on Wednesday, Israel Katz said the military must be prepared to act if Hamas refuses to implement the peace plan. The latest repatriations came after Israel said one of four bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday was not one of the missing hostages. The other three deceased were identified as Tamir Nimrodi, 20, Eitan Levy, 53, and Uriel Baruch, 35, the Hostages Families Forum said. Earlier on Wednesday UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher urged Israel to immediately open all crossings into Gaza for humanitarian aid, as called for in the ceasefire plan. In a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must ""make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages"". He added: ""As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid - thousands of trucks a week - on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted."" He called for ""more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles"" and said ""withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip"". Trump's ceasefire plan , which both Israel and Hamas accepted, envisaged the handover of all 48 hostages would be completed by noon on Monday. Hamas returned all the 20 living hostages on Monday. But the US-brokered ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday. Under the agreement, Israel also agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage. Israel has returned the bodies of a further 45 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry confirmed on Wednesday, bringing the total number of bodies released by Israel to 90. Meanwhile in Gaza, residents report growing concern about the durability of the ceasefire - and food prices have surged as Palestinians stockpile food. Traders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC. ""Every time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again,"" says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis. ""I lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I don't trust the ceasefire and we're sick of displacement."" She added that a trader in Khan Younis's main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. ""Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they don't trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop,"" Neven says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9py9940go,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/63fd/live/a0ff9900-aa01-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-15T20:56:33.957000+00:00,a8670490e988f3df3cb8c316d70bb0dd491d3d13
ea76959987e6,Government publishes evidence in collapsed China spy case,,"The government has published witness statements submitted in the now-collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. Deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins provided three witness statements to prosecutors on whether China had been regarded as a threat to national security at the time of the alleged offences. In his first statement, produced in December 2023, Collins said the Chinese Intelligence Services were ""highly capable and conduct large-scale espionage operations against the UK"". He added that these activities were designed to ""advance the Chinese state's interest and harm the interests and security of the UK"". In the second statement, written in February 2024, he wrote: ""China is an authoritarian state with different values to the UK. This presents challenges for both the UK and our allies. ""China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment but China also presents the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security."" He added that: ""It is important for me to emphasise, however that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China. ""The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised."" Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against the two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, both of whom deny the allegations. Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power. They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023. The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a ""threat to national security"" at the time of the alleged offences. The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing. However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence."" The publication of the documents followed pressure from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who had called for them to be released. On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them publishing the witness statements would be ""inappropriate"". But the CPS later made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put the government's evidence in the public domain.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex172rxwzo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a266/live/5582c670-a95a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-15T21:22:06.434000+00:00,e523f77fc0824ed08f01152e10bcff85f0f2e47b
76c67851362c,Trump confirms he authorised CIA action inside Venezuela,,"President Donald Trump has confirmed reports he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela - and said he was considering strikes targeting drug cartels there. US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN- appointed human rights experts have described the raids as ""extrajudicial executions"". Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said the US ""is looking at land"" as it considers further strikes in the region. Trump has sought to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro, who the US and others do not recognise as Venezuela's rightful leader following disputed elections. The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report. ""Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?"" a reporter asked. ""I authorised for two reasons really,"" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about a spy agency whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. ""Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America."" He added: ""And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also."" The president declined to answer when asked whether the CIA authorisation would allow the agency to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. ""Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?"" he said. While Maduro's government has not commented on the CIA authorisation directly, Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez struck a defiant tone on television on Wednesday. He said ""let no aggressor dare because they know that here is the people of [Venezuelan liberator Simón] Bolívar, that here is the people of our ancestors with their swords raised to defend us under any circumstance"". In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast. On Truth Social, Trump said that ""intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known"" drug-trafficking corridor. As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. The strikes form part of a larger military effort to pressure Maduro's government, which has included the positioning of significant air and naval assets in the region as well as about 4,000 troops. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers and reported by US media outlets, the administration said it had determined it was involved in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug-trafficking organisations. US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which it says includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has repeatedly denied the claims, and Venezuela's government has condemned the strikes.

f45e756c3f7d,Glasgow stun Koge with two late goals to progress in Europa Cup,,"It looked like City's hopes of a comeback had been extinguished after just three minutes when, as she did in the first leg, Mille Gejl opened the scoring for Koge. The former Crystal Palace midfielder took a short corner to Rikke Madsen and latched on to her fellow Denmark international's cutback from the byeline before steering her low drive into the far corner from just inside the penalty box. However, City were pinging the ball about far quicker than in the first leg in Denmark and were back level on the night within six minutes. Captain Amy Muir set Nicole Kozlova down the left wing and the former Koge player's low ball into the penalty box was fired home by strike partner Abby Harrison. A couple of fine saves from goalkeeper Lee Gibson denied the visitors before City were back level on aggregate on 25 minutes when Emily Whelan headed powerfully home after left-back Muir crossed to the back post. City's joy only lasted two minutes as veteran former Manchester City and Denmark forward Nadia Nadim turned in from the left wing and sent a right-foot drive looping over Gibson and into the far corner. Glasgow were ahead again on the night when Harrison rose with the visiting goalkeeper to meet a Lisa Evans corner and the ball deflected off Emma Pelkowski and into her own net. Fellow midfielder Sarah Thygesen pounced on an Emma Brownlie error to slot what looked like a killer strike for the Danes six minutes from normal time. However, Brownlie made amends by rising to meet another Evans corner and level the score on aggregate as the game entered added time. Just when it looked like extra time might be needed, Lisa Forrest headed a cross from fellow substitute forward Sofia Maatta over the stranded goalkeeper to signal joyous scenes among the home support.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx27y23v6x2o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/7ea3/live/29315860-aa0a-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg,2025-10-15T20:55:37.280000+00:00,6c5ac18ba056c32d3e37f76f276f09e711512189

The third episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and veteran British actress Celia Imrie releasing wind at a tense point in the game was one of the moments that got viewers talking. ""What just happened?"" presenter Claudia Winkleman demanded to know. ""I just farted Claudia. It's nerves, but I always own up,"" responded Imrie, sparking laughter. Winkleman then had to tell the celebrities to settle down, before they launched into another tough challenge. Fans online were left in hysterics, with one X user calling it ""the TV highlight of the year"" while another said we'd ""peaked as a nation"". ""Critically acclaimed thespian Celia Imrie farts like the rest of us folks,"" noted showbiz reporter Catrina Rose. But the latest episode wasn't all fun and games. By the end of the hour, two of the younger celebrities had been forced to leave the show. BBC/Studio Lambert Some fans raised concerns that Niko Omilana was banished because he was an ""outsider"" First up, Youtube star Niko Omilana , who was thought to be a traitor by celebrities including actor Sir Stephen Fry . After his banishment, the 27-year-old said: ""Can't believe I'm out so quickly but it's been an honour getting to know every single one of you... I can now reveal that this whole time I've been honest and I'm a faithful."" His departure sparked a backlash online by some fans, who were unhappy to see him go. ""They've all been cowards there,"" wrote one X user, adding: ""Niko has been voted because he's an outsider and he's not in their celebrity world. Nothing to do with the game."" ""Niko being eliminated has sent shockwaves through social media,"" said entertainment journalist Indigo Stafford. ""For many viewers, his elimination came out of nowhere. And now a new theory is spreading online about the real reason Niko was voted out... which is that the other contestants didn't know him well,"" she said. ""Since many of the celebs tend to move in the same circles, some fans are convinced that him being an outsider is what unnerved them."" Who are the two big dogs on Celebrity Traitors? The episode also saw Olympic diver Tom Daley , 31, murdered by the traitors. He said he was ""gutted"", but TV presenter Jonathan Ross - a traitor - quipped, ""gold medals don't count as shields do they"". Wednesday's action-packed episode concluded with actress and comedian Tameka Empson being banished at the roundtable, following suspicions that she could be a traitor. 'Tom's been murdered. Deal with it' Elsewhere, the third episode marked a shift in character for comedian - and Traitor - Alan Carr . Gone was the nervously giggling Carr, who we were all a bit worried for. Instead, he seemed to be embracing being a Traitor. In one scene, with his fellow Traitors, he offered to take the lead on writing down which celebrity they were murdering. ""I've got a taste for it now,"" he said, referring to his earlier murder of singer Paloma Faith . Later on, at breakfast, he appeared to roll his eyes at the other celebrities' reactions to Tom Daley's death. ""People couldn't believe it, 'Where's Tom? Why Tom?' Well he's been murdered. Deal with it."" ""Alan has happily become a killing machine,"" said Rose. Once again, fans were left with a cliffhanger, as the Traitors weighed up whether to murder actress Ruth Codd , singer Charlotte Church , or historian David Olusoga . But the episode ended on a lighter note, as Carr admitted to Imrie why he'd voted for her to be banished. ""Can I be honest with you? It was that fart in the hut,"" he said.

84399d83bbfe,Six by-election candidates take part in rowdy debate,,"Six by-election candidates take part in rowdy debate Adrian Browne Wales political reporter and David Deans Wales political reporter BBC From left to right: Richard Tunnicliffe, Lindsay Whittle, Llŷr Powell, Steve Aicheler, Gareth Potter and Gareth Hughes, who all took part in the debate The winner will represent Caerphilly in Cardiff Bay for about six months, until all of Wales can vote in next May's Senedd election. With eight days to go to the by-election, this is what we learned. 1. Pressure on public services is a big issue Candidates were asked by audience member Ryan Bevan what they would do to support and improve Caerphilly's public services. Plaid Cymru's Lindsay Whittle said ""we've seen the spirit and soul of our communities slowly fade away with the erosion"" of services, as amenities such as libraries and swimming pools closed or faced closure. Investment, he said, needed to be in ""the right places"" not ""top-heavy organisations"". Green Party candidate Gareth Hughes said the way to fund public services adequately was by ""taxing the rich"" properly, getting those with the ""broadest shoulders to carry the burden"", as was the case in continental European countries, he added. Reform's Llŷr Powell accused the Labour Welsh government of spending ""vast sums of money on projects that don't prioritise front line services"", saying he would ""prioritise frontline services right now"". Richard Tunnicliffe, who is defending the Caerphilly seat for Labour, heard accusations of hypocrisy, which he denied, for campaigning to keep libraries open when the local Labour council had been seeking to close them. He said he was ""passionate"" about libraries and made books for a living, as he was a publisher, and he wants funding from a UK government scheme to help libraries to survive. Liberal Democrat Steve Aicheler accused Tunnicliffe of hypocrisy but said there were ""absolutely difficult decisions"" to be made on budgets. ""Our priority is on care,"" he said, promoting what he called his party's ""most ambitious child care plan for Wales."" Conservative Gareth Potter said his party was the only one saying it would reverse next year's expansion of the Senedd from 60 to 96 members, saving £120m. ""We're the only party that says that £120m needs to go to frontline services in education and NHS, that's how we'll spend it,"" he said. 2. As always, the NHS looms large The second question came from audience member Jordan Morris, an NHS hospital pharmacist, who asked how candidates would reduce hospital waiting lists and improve access to GPs. Labour's Tunnicliffe said the Welsh government had ploughed £600m extra into the NHS and long waits were coming down. Lib Dem Aicheler accused Welsh Labour of 25 years of failure on the health service, praising his local GP surgery, and saying ""best practice"" should be shared to improve services across the board. Reform's Powell said there was no ""quick fix"" to the NHS and staff needed to be retained in the service, but was pressed on Reform leader Nigel Farage's previous comments on the NHS. Farage called for a debate on an insurance-based system when leading UKIP in 2015. ""I will not vote in any way to privatise the NHS,"" said Powell. He said that Farage was not a candidate in the by-election. Conservative Potter said Labour Welsh ministers were spending ""ridiculous"" amounts of money in areas that were not frontline services. Plaid's Whittle said better links were needed between health and social care to release beds in hospitals. BBC Wales Today presenter Nick Servini hosted the fiery one-hour debate 3. Immigration sparked the most emotional exchanges Llŷr Powell came under fire more than anyone else for his party's stance on migration. It was put to Powell that only 2.9% of people in Caerphilly were born outside of the UK - figures that come from the most recent census in 2021. Powell said that was out of date and that more had come to the UK since then, but did not have his own figure for the constituency. He said: ""I'm not saying it's all bad. What I'm saying is we need to get back to controlling migration,"" he said. Later, he was directly challenged by an audience member about the impact Reform's rhetoric was having on her own family. He was told: ""You're talking about human beings. You don't treat them like human beings."" Powell emphasised that he was talking about policy, saying: ""The level of immigration we've got coming in right now to the United Kingdom is too high."" Most of the rest of the candidates were less negative about immigration. Tunnicliffe said immigration was being ""weaponised"". He said it was a ""serious issue"" and said Labour wanted ""to fix it"". ""Controlled, legal migration has benefited and helped us. Helps the NHS, it helps the care homes. It helps some business."" Lindsay Whittle said he would be ""proud"" to continue to support the Welsh government's nation of sanctuary policy, which provides some support for refugees. ""The Ukrainian people are living in fear and hope of being sent back,"" he said. Aichler said he did not think immigration was a problem in Caerphilly, but the perception was. He said asylum seeker hotels were ""divisive"". Hughes accused Reform of ""making people that come to this country, fleeing from war, the enemy"". Potter said the nation of sanctuary policy needed to be looked at. He said he fully understood people coming from Ukraine because it was ""war torn"". 4. Politicians know trust is in short supply Labour's Tunnicliffe says he knew people were disappointed by politicians and he was not a ""career politician like Lindsay or Llŷr. I had a career"". The publisher said he was coming into politics ""only now"". ""I will work with anybody, if it helps to affect change for the people of this constituency,"" he said. Plaid's Whittle rejected the accusation from Tunnicliffe that he was a career politician. He said he liked to think those who had repeatedly voted him in as a councillor ""trust me"". Hughes, of the Green Party, said there was no trust in politics because politicians made ""promises they can't keep"". ""They need reasonable things put before them that are obtainable,"" he says. Reform's Powell said politics was at a ""sad level"" regarding trust. ""I'm trying to ask for a mandate to ask better for this area,"" he says. ""There isn't a magic wand, there isn't anything one of us can do,"" he said, adding he had tried to be ""frank and honest"" in his campaign. Potter, of the Conservatives, said no-one had voted for the 20mph speed limit policy, which was in the Labour manifesto at the last election but was not a big feature of the campaign at the time. ""20mph needs to disappear,"" he said. Lib Dem Aicheler backed the 20mph limit, saying there were hundreds of people who had not ""had to spend time visiting relatives in hospital"" because of it.

9950faa05c38,Grandfather relives eight-day 'nightmare' in Highland wilderness,,"Grandfather relives eight-day 'nightmare' in Highland wilderness Angie Brown Edinburgh and East reporter Ian Currie Ian Currie during a more successful trip a couple of years ago A 76-year-old hillwalker who survived eight days lost in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands has described it as ""one long black nightmare"". Ian Currie, from Edinburgh, had been attempting to walk from Glenfinnan to Knoydart when he got into perilous difficulty during bad weather. The 30-mile strenuous and pathless trek across mountainous terrain, rivers and boggy ground is part of the Cape Wrath Trail and is normally completed in three days. He told BBC Scotland News that he thought he was going to die during his ordeal but he was grateful to those - including the local laird - who came to his rescue. ""I am so happy I survived,"" the grandfather-of-one said. ""I kept thinking, if I'm dead I will never know how things turned out with my grandson's exams and how my friends are doing. ""I think that kept me going but it was one long dark nightmare. ""Never again will I be going off-piste like that, I've learned my limitations."" The experienced hillwalker set off on his expedition on 16 September after travelling to Glenfinnan by train. He planned to walk 15 miles a day and complete the trek in two days - but he quickly fell behind schedule. ""There is no official trail, as such. If you look on the map there are dotted lines but when you get there they don't exist because the ground is so muddy and the river winds along a narrow valley,"" Mr Currie said. ""So you are mostly walking up the river knee-deep in water and then there are bits with, for example, a six-foot-high rock or waterfall, which you have to get around. ""You have to follow the river basically and that was the problem because the weather came in so the river was in spate (swollen and fast-flowing)."" Mud up to the groin On the second night, he lay in his tent unable to sleep due to the ""roar"" of the wind and river. The next day he attempted to divert up a mountain to get around a large waterfall on hands and knees through ""very soggy ground"". ""It is the mud and wet and that is so slow and energy-sapping and there was one point when one leg sank up to my groin in mud and it was very difficult to get out,"" he said. He quickly became lost and when he set up his tent on the third night he found that it was soaked through - as was his sleeping bag and mobile phone, meaning he could not call for help. Ian Currie Ian took this picture of his tent on the first day of his trek before the weather turned He spent two nights there, exhausted and hemmed in by the weather. ""I was whole-body-shivering-cold and the worst part was not being able to sleep and not being able to do anything to help myself get out of there,"" he said. By this time, a friend of Mr Currie had raised the alarm - as he had not arrived at a bunkhouse in Knoydart as expected. Lying in his wet tent, Mr Currie hoped he might be rescued and listened for the sound of a helicopter, but it never came. ""I felt awful and lay there thinking 'how long does it take to die of exposure?',"" he said. When it stopped raining he found a spring where he was able to quench his thirst, but he was so unwell he was unable to eat one of the snack bars he was carrying. He decided to try to walk back the way he came. ""It was hands and knees stuff and skidding down on your bum through water,"" he said. He would walk for 10 minutes and then lie on his back, still attached to his rucksack, for 10 minutes. Ian Pooleman Ian Pooleman, of Lochaber Mountain rescue, took this picture during the search On the eighth day - 24 September - he came across an empty Lochaber Mountain Rescue vehicle, but the team's volunteers were out looking for him. He was finally found by Sir Patrick Grant, who owns the local Glen Dessary estate, and a group of deer stalkers. ""I thought some walker was just waving to me but as I got near him I realised this man's distressed so I stopped and I said 'Are you Ian Currie?',"" Sir Patrick said. ""And he said 'Yes I am' and he burst into tears. ""For someone who had been missing for eight days I was astonished he wasn't lying on the floor. He was tearful and distressed but able to stand up."" Sir Patrick added: ""My wife and the team did a wonderful job getting hot tea with sugar into him and got him out of his wet clothes and into a hot bath and my wife cleaned and dried his clothes."" They also managed to track down Mr Currie's daughter and called her at work. ""She was sobbing and screaming and sobbing and sobbing,"" Mr Currie said. Ian Currie Ian Currie during a walk in the Pentland Hills on the edge of Edinburgh Now he wants to thank the members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue, police officers and volunteers for the ""magnificent efforts"" they put into finding him. Mr Currie said he was also grateful for the support they gave his family and friends ""who were going through hell, desperate to know what was happening to me"". He said Sir Patrick and his family treated him ""so kindly"". And he added: ""[The staff at Belford Hospital] were very busy treating people a lot sicker than me, but they were, without exception, compassionate, friendly and caring. ""On behalf of my family, friends and myself, thank you all."" Ian Pooleman, of Lochaber Mountain Rescue, said the team was delighted to find Mr Currie. ""I think the fact anyone was able to survive for all those days with very little food in such an inhospitable place with some pretty adverse weather conditions is pretty amazing,"" he added.

56dbd1cb32e6,Chelsea's Thompson 'a real bright spark' but best 'still to come',,"Chelsea's dominant victory over Paris FC was lit up by the newest member of their attack, Alyssa Thompson, who traversed the Stamford Bridge pitch with agile runs and eventually got the rewards her efforts deserved. Thompson may be just 20 years old, but her arrival at Chelsea was accompanied by lofty expectations arising from the club record price tag. Now, in her seventh appearance, she has finally got off the mark. She darted down the wings and led her side's counter-attacks, showing expert positioning to put herself in the right place to be able to set up Johanna Rytting Kaneryd's goal, and tapped home an excellent Keira Walsh delivery to get her first goal for the club. It was an impressive display, but, says manager Sonia Bompastor, the best of her is still to come. ""A young player, a lot of talent, but I think we haven't seen yet the best of her, but hopefully we will see that soon,"" said Bompastor. ""She is coming from abroad, she speaks the language, which helps, but again, it's a new environment, a new club, she needs to learn to connect with new players on the pitch, new team-mates, so hopefully, even sooner, we will see an even better version."" Thompson's first goal is one which will put her at ""ease"", says Brighton forward Fran Kirby, who previously spent nine years at Chelsea. Former Scotland captain Rachel Corsie added that now Thompson has scored, she imagines the ""floodgates will open"". ""She's been a real bright spark,"" Kirby said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think against Tottenham she looked really sharp, it was probably that final product. ""Today, getting that assist and goal will make her feel a little bit more at ease going into the next game.

481cf0612563,'There was no conquest mission': Fans 'missed the point' of D’Angelo’s infamously steamy video,,"As MTV takes its last gasp , shuttering its final music channels in the UK, it feels strangely nostalgic to look back to the days when multiple television channels streamed music videos for hours each day, but it gave rise to the pop-as-product 2000s and the influencer era we find ourselves in now . Artists are meant to be seen, while they are being heard. Not every artist leaned into attractiveness back then. Some made their videos work with quirkiness or humour, like Busta Rhymes or Missy Elliott's wacky clips, which had them dressed like cartoon characters. Saucy, sensual R&B groups wouldn’t be nearly naked, but cloaked in an open leather jacket, pants and combat boots in the hot desert sun, for some reason. When Untitled dropped and a topless D'Angelo spun slowly as the camera moved in and out and up and down his torso with the speed of dripping molasses, everyone took notice. Alamy D'Angelo's Grammy-winning album Voodoo revealed an artistry and romanticism fans may miss if they stop at the Untitled video (Credit: Alamy) ""In college, I lived in a house with two other Black women with very different tastes in men,"" recalls Fredara Hadley , an author and ethnomusicology professor at Juilliard. ""But from the first chord, all three of us would crash land onto the couch to watch that Untitled video as if we had not just watched it several hours before."" Hadley notes that the video was released during a time of female objectification in music videos across genres. Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again came out the same year, but so did Destiny's Child's Independent Women. And while video vixens had been spinning their careers into empowerment, men weren’t being presented solely and obviously for the female gaze. D'Angelo’s video stood out, winning him a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2001. Voodoo took home R&B album of the year, with love-drunk lyrics that reveal a more romantic throughline. On Lady, D'Angelo sang about loving his girlfriend and wanting to tell everyone about it. The Root is about him being so in love with a woman that he asks a doctor for help. ""It was kinda therapeutic for me to do [The Root]… because I'm so pathetic in the song,"" D'Angelo says in a 1999 documentary filmed about the making of Voodoo. ""That's what The Root is, she got it on me and I’m just fucked up."" Untitled, then, was the departure. Journalist Touré, who interviewed D’Angelo for Rolling Stone in 2000, recalled in a recent Instagram clip that the video was the brainchild of D’Angelo’s manager, Dominique Trenier. She talked him into doing it, but when he arrived at the shoot, the singer wouldn’t leave his car. After being convinced to participate, Morgan recalls a female friend who was on set that fateful day describing the event as ""uncomfortable"" because the ""exploitation"" was evident. That presence continued with Thompson describing D’Angelo doing push-ups before gigs to make sure his body was in line with the Untitled image.

e52b49dff129,Millions needed to fix schools in 'state of disrepair',,"Millions needed to fix schools in 'state of disrepair' Robbie Meredith BBC News NI education and arts correspondent Rathcoole Primary School Rathcoole Primary School in County Antrim has had issues with broken windows Many schools in Northern Ireland ""are in a state of disrepair,"" and it would take up to £800m to fix them. A damning report from assembly members on Stormont's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the school maintenance backlog ""may pose a risk to the health and safety of pupils and staff"". Spending watchdog, the Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO), had previously found that many schools needed ""significant repair"". Education Minister Paul Givan said he acknowledged the PAC's concerns and shared its commitment to ensuring that every child is educated in a safe, modern, and inclusive environment. What does the PAC report say? The PAC said there had been ""systemic failure in the management of Northern Ireland's school estate,"" in which there are more than 1,100 schools. The report said that many children and teachers were working in overcrowded, poorly heated and ""failing structures"". The members said that the Department of Education (DE) and Education Authority (EA) had relied on ""a reactive short-term approach"", rather than having a ""clear plan"" for taking care of school buildings. They called that ""an alarming example of poor governance,"" and said the department's approach was ""unsustainable, ineffective and economically wasteful"". The report also criticised the collaboration between the EA and the department. The committee said the school maintenance backlog was between £600m and £800m. They set out several recommendations for change, including more regular condition surveys of schools and a comprehensive strategy and annual delivery plan from DE. ""The school estate is in unacceptably poor condition for children and staff and action is long overdue,"" they said. What do school heads think? Rathcoole Primary School The principal described the maintenance backlog as ""unsettling"" The principal of Rathcoole Primary School in County Antrim, Emma Quinn, has been speaking out about the work needed in her school for years. ""As a leader, much of my day is spent chasing works, reporting leaks, faulty toilets, broken windows - whilst essential, this should not be my primary focus,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It's unsettling that the backlog for maintenance and repair to our schools is still an ongoing concern. ""Schools amidst budget cuts, escalating complex needs, increased running costs are continually having to be creative in their everyday life in school to ensure high quality learning and teaching."" Ms Quinn said funding for a maintenance is ""simply not there"". Mercy College principal, Martin Moreland, said his school has ongoing problems with heating, lighting and leaks in its roof The principal of Mercy College post-primary school in north Belfast, Martin Moreland, called the issues uncovered by the PAC report ""unacceptable"". Mr Moreland said the school was in line for a new building, ""but getting there is probably going to be a 10-year journey"". ""Whilst you're waiting on that, it's a very expensive job maintaining an old school,"" he said. ""We've ongoing and frequent problems with heating, lighting, very dimly lit rooms because of the old lights, leaks in roofs constantly. ""We had several incidents last year where the heating system broke down on really cold days."" Rathcoole Primary School Ms Quinn said funding for a maintenance is ""simply not there"" What has the Education Authority said in response? In a statement, the EA said it welcomed the publication of the report, ""which clearly reflects the scale of the financial challenges faced by the education sector"". ""Recurring shortfalls in budgets mean that no funding is available for routine maintenance of the school estate"", the statement said, and only urgent repairs are undertaken. ""This limited but unavoidable focus inevitably leads to deterioration in the condition of the estate."" However, the EA said it was taking action ""in relation to the £29m statutory remedial backlog referenced in the report"". What about the Department of Education? Rathcoole Primary School Schools are facing a wait of up to ten years for new buildings The Education Minister Paul Givan welcomed the PAC's focus on ""urgent need for investment in the schools' estate"". In a statement Givan said: ""I acknowledge the committee's concerns and share its commitment to ensuring that every child in Northern Ireland is educated in a safe, modern, and inclusive environment. ""I value the report's contribution in exposing the scale of the challenge, particularly the chronic underinvestment in our schools' estate over many years."" The minister said the key issue is a lack of funding. He said: ""Nowhere is the pressure more acute than in Special Educational Needs (SEN) provision. ""The cost of emergency SEN placements has soared from £9 million in 2019 to a projected £85 million this year, which is an 850% increase in just six years.""

583ba323f89e,Thousands in UK sue Johnson & Johnson over talcum powder cancer risks,,"Thousands in UK sue Johnson & Johnson over talcum powder cancer risks Alamy A major legal claim has been filed in the UK against pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, accusing the firm of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos. The claim involves 3,000 people and focuses on internal memos and scientific reports, which have been seen by the BBC. The lawsuit alleges that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) was aware as early as the 1960s that its mineral-based talcum powder contained fibrous forms of talc, as well as tremolite and actinolite. Both minerals - when in their fibrous form - are classified as asbestos and linked to potentially deadly cancers. The court papers allege that, despite knowing the minerals were directly linked to cancers, J&J never issued warnings on the packaging of its baby powder. Instead it launched aggressive marketing campaigns portraying the powder as a symbol of purity and safety, the lawsuit claims. J&J denies the allegation as well as any claims it knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos. A statement, issued on behalf of the firm, said its baby powder ""was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer"". The sale of baby powder containing talc stopped in the UK in 2023. The UK action mirrors extensive litigation in the US, where multiple lawsuits have been filed and claimants have been awarded billions of dollars in damages. The company has successfully appealed in some cases. Lawyers for the claimants estimate damages sought in the UK could extend to hundreds of millions of pounds and that the claim could become the largest product liability case in British history. 'Keep the whole thing confidential' The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known cause of cancer. Talc, which was used in J&J talcum powders, is a naturally occurring mineral that is often mined in close proximity to deposits of asbestos. It is asbestos minerals in their fibrous needle-like form that are associated with cancer. The claim alleges J&J had identified asbestos in its baby powder as early as the 1960s. One internal document from 1973 allegedly says: ""Our baby powder contains talc fragments classifiable as fiber. Occasionally sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable…"" J&J says this letter was discussing how regulation might change and thereby define talc fibres as asbestos. The firm said that would have been wrong. In the same year, executives discussed the value of a possible patent for a method that aimed to remove asbestos fibres from talc. At the end of the letter, it added: ""We may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know."" J&J says these discussions were confidential because a new patent could have been extremely valuable if the new method had been effective. Ultimately, it did not prove to be effective. Instead of declaring warnings on the bottle, the lawsuit claims J&J moved to conceal the risk for decades and maximise profits. The claim alleges that, despite knowing there were carcinogenic fibres in the baby powder, the firm's marketing team discussed how to maximise sales. In the 1970s and 1980s, US marketing focused on the sale of pure and gentle powder for newborn babies. By the 1990s and into the 2000s the marketing focus turned to African American women. In 2008, an internal email - seen by the BBC - allegedly discussing branding, says, ""The reality that talc is unsafe for use on/around babies is disturbing…"" It went on to say: ""I don't think we can continue to call it baby powder and keep it in the baby aisle."" J&J says this conversation was in reference to asphyxiation, which was a rare but known risk at the time relating to use of all body powder, but was not linked to cancer or asbestos and was warned about on the bottle. Documents cited in the UK lawsuit are also alleged to show that from the early 1970s J&J executives pushed US regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept lower sensitivity standards so that tests did not pick up on small amounts of asbestos fibres. The claim cites internal documents, which it says show J&J advocated for talc testing standards that tolerated up to 1% asbestos contamination, arguing that more sensitive detection methods were unnecessary. This, the lawsuit alleges, enabled the company to maintain claims of product purity, misleading regulators and consumers about the presence of asbestos in its talc products. J&J says this misrepresents the context of the document, which references a hypothetical calculation, as requested by the FDA. 'My mother used it - I used it' Many of the claimants in the UK are suffering with, or have died from ovarian cancer, mesothelioma - a cancer that is usually caused by asbestos exposure - or other cancers. All the claimants are alleged to have used J&J's baby powder over an extended period of time. Siobhan Ryan, 63, was one young mother who saw the adverts and says she trusted J&J's baby powder. ""My mother used it and I used it. It smelt nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them,"" she told the BBC from her home in Somerset. ""It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage 4 ovarian cancer."" At the time of diagnosis it wasn't clear how long Siobhan would survive for, but after three rounds of chemotherapy, a bout of sepsis that nearly killed her, and major surgery to her abdomen, she is alive and able to tell her story 18 months later. Siobhan, like the other claimants in this case, thinks her cancer was caused by use of J&J's baby powder. The first rounds of treatment helped control the spread of her cancer, but a few months ago Siobhan found another lump in her groin. She is now back in chemotherapy and surgeons say her cancer is no longer operable. ""They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,"" Siobhan says. Siobhan had used J&J's baby powder on her children when they were babies Ovarian cancer is caused by a combination of genetic, internal and external factors. ""The female reproductive tract is open to the external environment so that women can get pregnant,"" says Prof Christina Fotopoulou, a leading gynaecological oncology surgeon at Imperial College London and a leader in the field of ovarian cancer. ""Cancer is usually an accumulation of mistakes in the reproduction cycle of the cells and so any harmful factors - internal or external - that disrupt the balance of the cells may contribute to these mistakes that eventually may lead to cancer."" Common symptoms of ovarian cancer include persistent bloating, persistent pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full quickly or an inability to eat, and an increased or urgent need to urinate. Those who experience such symptoms frequently - more than 12 times a month - should see a doctor. Extreme fatigue, changes in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhoea, and vaginal bleeding after menopause are also signs you should see your GP. Our baby powder 'was compliant' Earlier this month, a court in the US state of Connecticut ordered J&J - and its successor entities - to pay $25m to a man diagnosed with terminal peritoneal mesothelioma after lifelong use of J&J baby powder. The jury in the trial found the pharmaceutical company negligent for selling asbestos-contaminated talc products. This trial also included deposition testimony from Dr Steve Mann, former director of toxicology at J&J consumer products, who said he had made safety claims without reviewing any test data. Dr Mann conceded that he had received test results showing asbestos in the baby powder but chose not to inform management or regulators. The judge noted that safer alternatives, such as cornstarch, were available and known to the company, yet J&J continued selling talc-based powder in the US until 2020 and in the UK until three years later. Following the Connecticut judgement, J&J has denied wrongdoing and is expected to appeal. J&J has moved its consumer health arm to a new company, called Kenvue, which said in a statement: ""We sympathise deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers - that's why the facts are so important."" It said the safety of the baby powder was backed by years of testing by ""independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the UK and around the world"". It said J&J's baby powder ""was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797wv928g8o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0fad/live/ac7b7110-a9d3-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-16T00:22:16.279000+00:00,234e55f0deb163938ab0872f17613de8ba4f453a
3259ee459052,Reeves urged to make Budget 'bold' or risk future tax rises,,"The chancellor should be ""bold"" in next month's Budget or risk future spending cuts and tax rises, an influential think tank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes. Finding this amount would allow the government to maintain the £10bn of headroom it has built into the system - but the IFS says there is a ""strong case"" for trying to increase it beyond this amount. IFS director Helen Miller said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor ""limping from one forecast to the next"". ""A key challenge is ensuring that fiscal groundhog day doesn't become a twice-yearly ritual,"" Ms Miller said. She said the position the chancellor finds herself in was ""to a large extent, a situation of her own making"". ""When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course,"" Ms Miller added. The think tank pointed to rising borrowing costs, weaker growth forecasts and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the government's tight position. It said Reeves needs to make up that shortfall so she can meet her own fiscal rules, which she has called ""non-negotiable"". The two main rules are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament Ms Miller added that the ""constant obsession with the headroom"" was a distraction from important debates on how policy could bolster economic growth and the reform of the tax system. Speaking on Wednesday, Reeves gave the strongest indication to date that she is planning to raise taxes in the Budget. The IFS's green budget looks ahead to some of the decisions the government will have to make in its 26 November Budget. The report is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced in association with Barclays. In a chapter of its report published last week , the IFS urged said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward. During last year's election, Labour said they ""will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT"" - which the IFS flags as the simplest ways to raise revenue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n8v34jvlo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f54f/live/8f97b450-a9c9-11f0-a5c2-cb318711a6b0.jpg,2025-10-15T23:02:53.706000+00:00,8413ea1f3acc04a5cf66a34d95a74ba392e8a0df
04a154d74afd,"Months after fall of Assad, families of Syria's missing still seeking justice",,"Months after fall of Assad, families of Syria's missing still seeking justice Orla Guerin Senior International Correspondent, in Syria BBC/Goktay Koraltan Human remains have been unearthed at this site in Eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus A burly bearded man in a blue tunic moved swiftly through grassy stubble on a windswept road in rural Damascus, collecting bones with his bare hands. He added a jaw to the pile, before gently picking up a skull. Briefly, he kissed it - a moment of tenderness for one of the many victims of Bashar al-Assad. Ten months after Assad was ousted from power last December, in a lightning rebel advance, mass graves are still being uncovered. The Syrian dictator's legacy is embedded in the soil here - skeletal remains where crops should be. There are now more than 60 grave sites and counting. One of the latest came to light in al-Otaiba village, in the district of Eastern Ghouta, where a shepherd stumbled on clothing and human remains after straw was burnt off. The authorities believe as many as 175 bodies were bulldozed into a mass grave in this former opposition stronghold. They are among the legions of the missing. More than 181,000 people were forcibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained during the 14 years of Syria's civil war, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights monitoring group. It says 90% were taken by the Assad regime. BBC/Goktay Koraltan Little remains of the estimated 175 people buried in the mass grave in al-Otaiba village The families of the missing are now demanding answers and justice, from the new Syria – which held its first parliamentary election, of a sort, earlier this month. A ""people's assembly"" was chosen but not directly by the people. One-third of the seats remain to be filled.  The appointees will be hand-picked by Syria's Interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Depending on your viewpoint in this broken country, and perhaps on your religion or your sect, the election was either a sham or a first step on the road to democracy. As Syria faces forward, President Sharaa - a jihadi fighter turned head of state - says the missing will remain ""a national priority"". BBC/Goktay Koraltan Kasim Hamami found a garment which belonged to his missing brother Bereaved relatives like Kasim Hamami are counting on that. They can do little else. We found him digging by the roadside at the mass grave site, pulling secrets from the soil. As we watched, he uncovered a frayed, brownish jumper covered in dirt. It was a last trace of Samer, his brother, who disappeared aged 21. ""Samer was a civilian,"" Kasim said softly, ""and newly-wed, just 15 days into his marriage. He had nothing to do with armed groups. He didn't fight anybody,"" he said. ""Ghouta was under a blockade. The regime did not allow in any food. He left because of hunger."" Kasim's three nephews also left with Samer and shared his fate. They were among around 400 people who set out from Eastern Ghouta on 27 February 2014, hoping to reach another rebel stronghold. On the way, they were attacked by the regime and its allies in Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia backed by Iran. We know this because they filmed the slaughter and published the footage. The video - widely circulated online - is hard to watch. BBC/Goktay Koraltan Those buried in al-Otaiba are believed to have been killed by Assad regime forces and their Hezbollah allies It shows a column of people walking along a road, straight into an ambush. Landmines are detonated along a 300m (985ft) stretch. The explosions are followed by a hail of bullets. The convoy was mostly men, but included women and children, according to Mohammed Omar Hajjar, the newly appointed public prosecutor for rural Damascus. He believes they were civilians. The regime claimed at the time that the dead were fighters. We met one of the survivors, who gave us a first-hand account of the attack. Bilal, a nurse, was back at the mass grave site, glancing around at the sunlit landscape, reliving his darkest night. BBC/Goktay Koraltan Bilal survived the attack on the convoy in 2014 ""We left at around midnight,"" he told us. ""I walked behind my colleague, 30m apart. After the mines went off, the wounded were screaming. They killed them in cold blood. I could hear two voices, and I could not help."" Bilal says he survived by hiding in a bush until the following day and is speaking out now for those who can't. ""I lost my nephew, friends and relatives. Those who set up the ambush should be held to account,"" he said. Will that happen? Many senior figures from the former regime are on the run, and Hezbollah has been devastated by Israeli attacks, and Israel's war on Lebanon in 2024. A Syrian judge has issued an arrest warrant, in absentia, for Bashar al-Assad, in relation to other killings. But the former president has found refuge in Russia – which backed him during the civil war. It's not known if his fate was discussed when President Sharaa held talks with President Putin in Moscow on Wednesday – the former enemies shaking hands in the Kremlin and discussing how to strengthen relations.  If Assad was watching, it won't have been easy viewing. Back home, there is one major change for families he destroyed. They can now share their anguish without risking their lives. BBC/Goktay Koraltan Syrians with missing loved ones are gathering in ""truth tents"" to share their experiences About an hour's drive from the mass grave, we joined a gathering of wives, mothers and daughters of the missing. They met at a ""Truth Tent"" - a community-led forum where Syrians lay bare the horrors of the past. In this case the ""tent"" was a village hall. More than a hundred women crowded in - so many there weren't enough chairs - many wearing black abayas and headscarves. They gathered around us, holding out photos of husbands, fathers or sons - men who may live now only in their memory. More photos were hung in rows on the wall. One woman paused before the display and raised her hand to caress an image. A softly spoken 18-year-old called Bisan recalled how her father was taken away at gunpoint, when she was just four years old. ""They got my dad, handcuffed him and put him in the van,"" she said. ""He asked them why he was being arrested. One of them pointed a gun against his head. We were so scared. We could not do anything back then. I was young and my mum kept crying."" Her cousin stood alongside as she spoke. Her father was also taken. Around the room, voices rose and fell in a chorus of harrowing accounts of loved ones snatched from work or home and swallowed by the regime's notorious prison system. ""Prisons were filled with the blood, and lives of the innocent,"" shouted one woman from the back of the hall. ""We spent a lot... sometimes even selling our houses, to pay some dog from the regime for information about our brothers, sons or husbands."" Another woman described being asked to choose between freedom for her son or her husband. ""They took me and my son to the security branch,"" she said. ""They beat us both. They showed me my son on the camera and asked me if I wanted my husband or my son. I said I wanted my son."" The authorities asked her to sign a paper saying her husband was a terrorist, but she refused. ""I never saw him carrying a weapon,"" she said. ""He went out demonstrating because he was hungry."" BBC/Goktay Koraltan Bisan last saw her father when she was four Another veiled woman shouted her demand: execute Bashar al-Assad. ""We will get our rights when he is hanged,"" she said. ""He's to blame for everything.  When we cut the head off the snake, we will heal and make peace with each other."" Najwa, one of the organisers, took to the stage to urge the families to be patient. Her husband Mohammed al-Hallaq was taken in January 2014. She was given his death certificate later that year but has never found his body. ""The son of a pig, Bashar, broke us for 14 years,"" said Najwa, her voice laden with anger. ""The only thing I ask of you: don't give up, don't stop pushing. It's not going to happen overnight."" Some wonder if it will happen at all, including a bereaved father called Mohammed, one of the few men at the meeting. His son, Mazen, who worked at the electricity company, was taken by state security in 2013. ""All this talk is not useful, if we don't get action,"" he said tearfully. ""What we need is for the people who took our sons to be on trial."" There is a now a National Commission for Missing Persons, but it is in its infancy and struggling with a lack of resources - including DNA testing facilities. Syria has only one DNA laboratory. Ten months after the ousting of Assad, the ranks of the missing are still growing. Some families are only now coming forward with accounts of loved ones who are long gone. ""We try to manage expectations,"" says Zeina Shahla, spokesperson for the commission. ""We tell the families we have begun but unfortunately it will take years. In every Syrian village, there might be missing persons."" At best their loved ones can expect more years of waiting for truth, or justice, or bones to bury.

c5139f7f7bd0,China sacks officials over viral Arc'teryx fireworks show in Tibet,,"Four Chinese officials have been dismissed over a fireworks display in the Himalayas last month by outdoor apparel brand Arc'teryx that drew heated criticism. Videos of brightly coloured fireworks that apparently resembled a ""rising dragon"" erupting over a lush Tibetan landscape had sparked environmental concerns and a boycott campaign. Arc'teryx and the Chinese pyrotechnics artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who designed the show, later apologised. Authorities in Tibet's Shigatse city said in a statement on Wednesday that more officials had been investigated and given warnings. They added that Arc'teryx and Cai have to provide compensation and help ""restore the environment"". Authorities said the fireworks, which lasted for nearly a minute and affected around 30 hectares (74 acres) of grassland, have caused limited short-term damage but said further monitoring was needed to assess ""ecological risks"". ""The incident created fireworks remnants, plastic debris and other things that were not thoroughly cleaned,"" the statement added. ""The instantaneous bright light and loud noise produced by the fireworks caused short-term disturbance to wild animals."" The four officials who have been sacked include Gyantse county's Communist Party secretary, public security chief and two senior members of county and city-level environmental agencies. The artist who orchestrated the display, Cai, is best-known for his role behind fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He has said he would work with authorities in Tibet to help with the area's recovery. Social media users, who said the stunt ran counter to Arc'teryx's conservation-focused image, had called for a boycott of the brand. Arc'teryx was founded in 1989 and has more than 150 shops worldwide. It is now owned by a Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports. The firm claimed the display had been aimed to promote local mountain culture, but said in its apology that it was ""out of line with Arc'teryx's values"". It also said it had used biodegradable materials and would work with an external agency to assess the project's impact.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq4305336o,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ed0e/live/dbba2640-aa2f-11f0-bc9d-616333c1ea01.png,2025-10-16T02:14:37.223000+00:00,fce7b794fff6e84db191b72764d0ad9999fde285
66830427b311,Russia intensifies attacks on Ukraine's trains in 'battle for the railways',,"Russia intensifies attacks on Ukraine's trains in 'battle for the railways' Iona Hampson/BBC Train conductor Olha Zolotova was badly injured in a Russian strike on her train Propped up in her hospital bed, railway conductor Olha Zolotova speaks slowly and quietly as she talks about the day her train was hit by a Russian drone. ""When the Shahed [drone] hit I was covered in rubble. I was in the second car. People pulled me out,"" she says. ""My eyes went dark. There was fire everywhere, everything was burning, my hair caught fire a little. I was trapped."" Olha is a victim of Russia's increasingly frequent attacks on the Ukrainian railway system – vital infrastructure that keeps the country moving three and a half years since Moscow's full-scale invasion. Ukraine's 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway system is not merely a mode of transport, it is a central pillar of Ukraine's war effort and a powerful national symbol of resilience. Olha's injuries were severe, so she was transported more than 300km (185 miles) to a special hospital in the capital, Kyiv, dedicated to railway workers. She has just had surgery on her hip and a metal plate inserted into her leg. Kat Werner/BBC Russia is increasing its strikes on Ukraine's vast and vital rail network Her train was hit earlier this month at a station in Shostka in the northern Sumy region. As rescue workers sought to tend to the injured, a second Russian drone struck the station – a type of hit known as a ""double tap"". Ukraine says civilians and rescue teams were directly targeted, which would constitute a possible war crime under international law. Thirty people in total were hurt. Of those treated in hospital, three were children, and one man was found dead, possibly from a heart attack. According to national rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ), there were twice as many attacks in September as there were in August - not just on trains but on the infrastructure that supports the rail network. In fact, half of the attacks on the railways since the beginning of the war have taken place in the past two months, says Oleksiy Balesta, a deputy minister at the department that oversees the rail network. ""Almost every day for the last two months, we have been experiencing targeted attacks on Ukrzaliznytsia infrastructure and on power transmission facilities,"" he says. Balesta suggests Russia has been ""hunting for locomotives - deliberately targeting both freight and passenger trains"". Behind the deputy minister is a wrecked locomotive, part of Ukraine's intercity fleet that was targeted in eastern Kyiv on one particularly devastating night at the end of August. The attack also included a strike on a key rail junction in Koziatyn in the central Vinnytsia region, creating delays and forcing significant diversions. As he speaks, Balesta receives a message from his assistant. There has been another attack on a train between Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in the eastern Donetsk region, close to the front line. Already today there have been three bomb threats on other services, forcing staff to evacuate the trains until explosives experts have given the all clear. Officials here point to two principal factors which they believe have led to this intensified spate of attacks. First, Russia's increasing capacity to produce large numbers of relatively cheap Shahed-type drones each day, which are increasingly able to fly greater distances. Then there is the near stalemate on the front line - and the consequent shift in focus by the Russian army to disrupt supply lines instead. ""It's a very clear battle for the railways,"" says Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, chief executive of UZ. ""The enemy is trying to stop us completely. This is part of a war tactic meant to cause panic among civilians, destroy our economy, and make the country unliveable."" Repairing damage as fast as possible, co-ordinating with the military and training its staff to recognise potential sabotage threats are all key to Ukraine's response, says Pertsovskyi. ""Lastly, we always have Plan B, C and D. The goal is never to cancel a single service or destination. If a train can't run, we combine trains and buses."" On top of the practicalities, there is also a clear eye on the morale of passengers. ""Recently, a train from Kyiv to Sumy had to be rerouted, adding six hours due to safety reasons,"" says the UZ chief. ""A passenger posted on social media that she'd be spending her birthday on the train instead of with her boyfriend - but said she understood. We sent her a cake and flowers."" The constant threat of missiles and drones means flying people and supplies around the country is nearly impossible. Much of the grain and iron ore exports that Ukraine's economy depends on is moved by train to the southern Black Sea ports, and westward through Poland. Visiting political leaders from all around the world also all enter the country by train – ""iron diplomacy"", as Ukrainians call it. The workers who have been caught up in attacks are called ""iron heroes"". Kat Werner/BBC Kyiv central station is a major hub in Ukraine's rail network In the grandeur of Kyiv's central station, another government minister awards certificates of bravery to the latest group of Iron Heroes - those who fought the fires on the night the intercity depot was attacked. ""It was very scary because there was a lot of fire and damage,"" says Oleksandr Leonenko, who helped extinguish the flames. He proudly shows me his certificate and says it will mean some extra pay. The uptick of attacks on the railway has coincided with Russia targeting Ukraine's power infrastructure. One recent set of attacks left hundreds of thousands without electricity. Ukraine has meanwhile launched a series of attacks on Russian oil refineries and claims to have inflicted petrol shortages in many areas. As Ukrainians eye their fourth winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began, UZ's Oleksandr Pertsovskyi believes the attacks on their infrastructure could bring about the hardest winter yet. In a message echoed by many Ukrainian officials, he calls on the country's allies to supply stronger air defences. ""But we're not desperate. We're preparing mentally and practically. Ukrainians remain strong in spirit."" That spirit looks set to be tested to the limit in the coming months.

c0005872371c,'I can't afford to save both twins': Sudan's war left one mother with an impossible choice,,"'I can't afford to save both twins': Sudan's war left one mother with an impossible choice Nawal Al-Maghafi Senior international investigations correspondent, Khartoum and Scarlett Barter BBC World Service, Khartoum Touma's life and family have been devastated by Sudan's civil war Warning: This piece contains details that some readers may find distressing Touma hasn't eaten in days. She sits silently, her eyes glassy as she stares aimlessly across the hospital ward. In her arms, motionless and severely malnourished, lies her three-year-old daughter, Masajed. Touma seems numb to the cries of the other young children around her. ""I wish she would cry,"" the 25-year-old mother tells us , looking at her daughter. ""She hasn't cried in days."" Bashaer Hospital is one of the last functioning hospitals in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, devastated by the civil war which has been raging since April 2023. Many have travelled hours to get here for specialist care. The malnutrition ward is filled with children who are too weak to fight disease, their mothers by their bedside, helpless. Cries here can't be soothed and each one cuts deep. Touma and her family were forced to flee after fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) reached their home about 200km (125 miles) south-west of Khartoum. ""[The RSF] took everything we owned - our money and our livestock - straight out of our hands,"" she says. ""We escaped with only our lives."" With no money or food, Touma's children began to suffer. She looks stunned as she recounts their old life. ""In the past, our house was full of goodness. We had livestock, milk and dates. But now we have nothing."" Sudan is currently experiencing one of the world's worst humanitarian emergencies. According to the UN, three million children under the age of five are acutely malnourished. The hospitals that are left are overwhelmed. Bashaer Hospital offers care and basic treatment free of charge. However, the lifesaving medicines needed by the children in the malnutrition ward must be paid for by their families. Masajed is a twin, she and her sister Manahil were brought to the hospital together. But the family could only afford antibiotics for one child. Touma had to make the impossible choice – she chose Manahil. ""I wish they could both recover and grow,"" her grief-stricken voice cracks, ""and that I could watch them walking and playing together as they did before. ""I just want them both to get better,"" Touma says, cradling her dying daughter. ""I am alone. I have nothing. I have only God."" Survival rates here are low. For the families on this ward the war has taken everything. They have been left with nothing and no means to buy the medicines that would save their children. As we leave, the doctor says none of the children in this ward will survive. Across the whole of Khartoum, children's lives have been rewritten by the civil war. Liam Weir / BBC Reminders of the conflict lie strewn across Khartoum What began as an eruption of fighting between forces loyal to two generals – army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti – soon engulfed the city. For two years – until last March when the army retook control - the city was gripped by war as rival fighters clashed. Khartoum, once a hub of culture and commerce on the banks of the River Nile, became a battlefield. Tanks rolled into neighbourhoods. Fighter jets roared overhead. Civilians were trapped between crossfire, artillery bombardments and drone strikes. It is in this devastated landscape, amid the silence of destruction, that the fragile voice of a child rises from the rubble. Twelve-year-old Zaher wheels himself through the wreckage, past burnt-out cars, tanks, broken houses and forgotten bullets. ""I'm coming home,"" he sings softly to himself as his wheelchair rolls over broken glass and shrapnel. ""I can no longer see my home. Where's my home?"" Zaher still loves to play football His voice, fragile but determined, contains both a lament for what has been lost and a quiet hope that one day, he may finally go home. In a building now being used as a shelter, Zaher's mother Habibah tells me about what life was like under RSF control. ""The situation was very difficult,"" she says. ""We couldn't switch on our lights at night - it was as if we were thieves. We didn't light fires. We didn't move at all at night."" She sits next to her son in a room lined with single beds. ""At any moment, whether you were sleeping or taking a shower, standing or sitting, you find them [the RSF] breathing down your neck."" Many fled the capital, but Zaher and his mother had no means to get out. To survive, they sold lentils on the streets. Then one morning, as they worked side by side, a drone struck. ""I looked at him and he was bleeding. There was blood everywhere,"" Habibah says. ""I was losing consciousness. I forced myself to stay awake because I knew if I passed out, I would lose him forever."" Zaher's legs were badly damaged. After hours of agony, they made it to hospital    . ""I kept praying: 'Please God, take my life instead of his legs,'"" she cries. But doctors could not save his legs. Both had to be amputated just below the knee. ""He would wake up and ask: 'Why did you let them cut my legs?'"" She looks down, her face filled with remorse, ""I couldn't answer."" Both Habiba and her son weep, tormented by the memory of what happened to them. It is made worse by knowing that prosthetic limbs could give Zaher a chance at his old childhood, but Habiba cannot afford them. For Zaher, the memory of what happened is too difficult to talk about. He only shares one simple dream. ""I wish I could have prosthetic legs so I can play football with my friends like I used to. That's all."" Children in Khartoum have been robbed not only of their childhoods but of safe places to play and be young. Schools, football pitches and playgrounds are now shattered, with broken reminders of a life stolen by conflict. ""It was very nice here,"" says 16-year-old Ahmed looking around a destroyed funfair and playground. Ahmed has found human remains at a playground where he is paid to tidy up Printed on his grey, tattered T-shirt is a huge smiley face - the word ""smile"" emblazoned beneath it. But his reality could not be further from that sentiment. ""My brothers and I used to come here. We played all day and laughed so much. But when I came back after the war, I couldn't believe it was the same place."" Ahmed now lives and works here clearing the debris left by war, earning $50 (£37) for 30 days of continuous labour. The money helps support him, his mother, grandmother and one of his brothers. There were six other brothers but, like so many in Sudan who have missing family members, he has lost contact with them. He looks at his feet as he tells us he doesn't know where they are or if any are still alive. The war has ripped families like his apart. Ahmed's work reminds him of that nearly daily. ""I have found the remains of 15 bodies so far,"" he says. Many of the remains found here have since been buried, but there are still some bones lying around. Ahmed walks across the park and picks up a human jaw. ""It's terrifying. It makes me shake."" He shows us another bone and holding it innocently beside his leg, he says: ""This is a leg bone, like mine."" Ahmed says he no longer dares to dream of a future. ""Ever since the war began, I have been certain that I was destined to die. So I stopped thinking about what I would do in the future."" The destruction of schools has put the future of children in even more jeopardy. Millions are no longer being educated. But Zaher is one of the lucky few. He and his friends attend school in a makeshift classroom set up by volunteers in an abandoned home. They call out answers loudly, write on the board, sing songs and there are even a few naughty kids messing around at the back of the class. Hearing the sound of children learning and laughing, in a country where places to be a kid are so limited, is like nectar. When we ask what childhood should be like, Zaher's classmates answer with innocence still intact: ""We should be playing, studying, reading."" But the memory of war is never far away. ""We shouldn't be afraid of the bombs and the bullets,"" interrupts Zaher. ""We should be brave."" Their teacher, Miss Amal, has taught for 45 years. She has never seen children so traumatised. ""They've been really affected by the war,"" she says. ""Their mental health, their vocabulary. They are speaking the language of the militias. Violent curse words, even physical violence. They carry sticks and whips, wanting to hit someone. They have become so anxious."" The damage extends beyond behaviour. With most families stripped of income, food shortages are biting. ""Some students come from homes with no bread, no flour, no milk, no oil, nothing at all,"" the teacher says. And yet, amid despair, Sudan's children cling to fleeting moments of joy. On a scarred football pitch, Zaher drags himself across the dirt on his knees, determined to play the game he loves most. His friends cheer him on as he kicks the ball. ""My favourite thing to do is football,"" he says, smiling for the first time. When asked which team he supports, the answer is immediate: ""Real Madrid."" His favourite player? ""Vinícius."" Playing on his knees is extremely painful and could lead to more infections.  But he doesn't care. Football and his friendships have saved him. They have brought him joy and an escape from his reality. Yet, he dreams of prosthetic legs. ""I wish they would just fix me, so I could walk home and go to school,"" Zaher says.

dc36756bebe7,China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown,,"China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown Tessa Wong Asia Digital Reporter and Kelly Ng Reuters Jin Mingri, seen here in a 2018 file photo, is one of 30 Christians arrested in China last weekend Last Friday Grace Jin Drexel received a text from her father in China, the prominent pastor Jin Mingri, telling her to pray for another pastor who had gone missing. The text said that the other pastor had been detained while visiting the southern  city of Shenzhen. ""Shortly after that, I got a call from my mum. She said she couldn't contact my dad,"" Ms Jin Drexel, who lives in the US, told the BBC. Within hours her family realised that Mr Jin had also been caught up in what has been described by activists as China's largest arrest of Christians in decades. Some now fear that last weekend's roundup of 30 Christians linked to the Zion Church network, which Mr Jin founded, marks the start of what could be a wider crackdown on underground churches. They point to new laws passed in China which appear aimed at curbing underground church activity, and increasing pressure exerted by authorities on church members in recent months. Despite being ruled by the atheist Chinese Communist Party, China has a sizeable Christian population. Government figures in recent years have stated there are about 38 million Protestants and nearly six million Catholics. But these figures likely only account for members of churches registered with the officially approved Catholic Patriotic Association and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which emphasise loyalty to China and the Communist Party. Rights activists and scholars estimate that tens of millions more Chinese attend unregistered churches, also known as house churches, which do not follow state-sanctioned ideologies. Many of these churches have been impacted by the Chinese government's attempts to increase its control of religious groups over the years. Church buildings have been demolished and crosses have been removed from public view, while religious material has become more tightly policed, with some Christian apps banned in China. In 2005 and again in 2018, the government revised and tightened regulations on religious groups, while in 2016, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the ""sinicisation"" of religion. Underground churches such as Zion were especially affected by the 2018 rules, which required government approval for worshipping in public. Many were forced to stop public activities and turned to holding online services, or simply shut down. The following years also saw the arrests and sentencing of a few prominent pastors. In recent months, there have been signs of Chinese authorities once again tightening the screws. In May, pastor Gao Quanfu of the Light of Zion Church in Xi'an was detained on charges of ""using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of law"". The following month saw several members of the Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi sentenced to years in prison for fraud, which rights groups have criticised as false convictions. Then in September, authorities announced a new online code of conduct for religious personnel, which only allows online sermons to be conducted by licensed groups. This has been widely seen as an attempt to curtail underground churches' online services. In the last few months, Zion church members have also faced increasing questioning by police officers, Ms Jin Drexel said. Many in Zion saw the stepped-up pressure as a prelude to a crackdown, but few anticipated it would be as large as it turned out to be, she said. Last Friday and Saturday, Chinese authorities launched what's been described as a sweeping crackdown across at least 10 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Besides Mr Jin who was taken from his main base in Beihai city in Guangxi province, they arrested other pastors, leaders and members of the congregation, according to the church. CSW Police officers arresting pastor Sun Cong of Zion Church (centre) were seen going through his books The BBC has obtained a copy of what appears to be an official detention notice for Mr Jin, issued by the public security bureau in Beihai. It states that Mr Jin is currently held in the Beihai Number Two prison and that he is suspected of ""illegal use of information networks"". The BBC has asked local authorities to confirm the detention. Some of the arrested church members have since been released, but the majority are thought to still be in detention, with some housed in the same prison as Mr Jin. Corey Jackson, founder of Christian advocacy group Luke Alliance, said the nationwide scale and co-ordination of the arrests across China were unprecedented. ""We anticipate that this is just the beginning of a larger crackdown,"" he said, adding that other underground churches in China were now preparing themselves for arrests. Another Christian advocacy group, Open Doors, said the arrests were significant. ""Zion Church was very well known and outspoken and it may have reached the level of organisation that authorities are getting nervous about organised social entities they do not control,"" a spokesperson said. He warned that China's ""policy of acting against house churches will continue"" and that authorities may accuse more church members of fraud and economic crimes ""as a strategy of intimidation"". Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor and spokesperson based in the US, said other churches will be targeted as there is ""a new wave of religious persecution emerging quickly across China"". He called the latest arrests a ""systematic roundup"" to ""unroot Zion"", and quoted the Chinese idiom ""killing the chicken to scare the monkeys"". ""Zion is the chicken, we are the most influential... it's to scare other Christians and house churches in China."" When asked by the BBC for a response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said: ""We would like to stress that the Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. Meanwhile, all religious groups and religious activities must comply with the laws and regulations of China."" Earlier this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it ""firmly opposes the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues"", in response to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's condemnation of the Zion church arrests. Getty Images China officially has 38 million Protestants and six million Catholics, but tens of millions more Chinese are believed to attend underground churches Zion's story began with Jin Mingri, also known as Ezra Jin. Born in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, he was a believer in the Chinese state while growing up. That changed in 1989 when, as a student in the prestigious Beijing University, he began taking part in the pro-democracy movement that was eventually crushed in the Tiananmen Massacre . While he did not happen to be at Tiananmen on 4 June, the events at the square changed his life. ""It was a pivotal moment. For his whole life, he had faith in the state. When that was betrayed, it shattered his entire world view. It was a big come-to-Jesus moment,"" Ms Jin Drexel said. At first Mr Jin pursued his new Christian faith at a Three-Self church. In 2002 he moved to the US with his wife and daughter to study at a seminary in California, where his two sons were born. The family moved back to China in 2007 for Mr Jin to continue his work. But he decided to set up an independent church,  said Ms Jin Drexel, as he could no longer accept the Three-Self doctrine which calls for allegiance to the Chinese state. ""He couldn't be a pastor there as it was not a God-pleasing church... you can't serve two masters."" Zion began as a small house church in Beijing with just 20 followers. But over the years it expanded and began holding services in a large hall in an office building. As it grew in influence, so did the scrutiny. In 2018, Chinese authorities asked the church to install CCTV cameras in the building, saying it was for ""security"". When it refused, followers began facing what church leaders say was harassment. Later that year, the church was shut down. An exit ban was imposed on Mr Jin, who was placed under close surveillance. His family was able to leave for the US, as did some other church members such as Mr Long. Zion then pivoted to what Mr Long called a ""hybrid model"" where they would hold large online church services coupled with small offline meetings in person. The church grew to about 100 branches across 40 cities in China, and has more than 10,000 followers now. It is why, while the fate of Mr Jin and the other arrested church members remains uncertain and the possibility of a wider crackdown looms, Mr Long is confident that Zion and China's underground churches will survive. ""Persecution cannot destroy the church,"" he said. ""If you look back to history, where there is repression, there's a revival.""

cfc7a714a471,Indian cinema tickets are getting pricier - but not everyone's complaining,,"Indian cinema tickets are getting pricier - but not everyone's complaining Nikita Yadav BBC News, Delhi Getty Images India has seen a steady rise in average movie ticket prices over the past few years Sahil Arora, 20, had been eagerly waiting to watch the latest Bollywood release starring his favourite actor. But going to the theatre set him back considerably - a seat at a Delhi multiplex cost 500 rupees ($6; £4), nearly a third of his weekly pocket money. ""I enjoyed the movie, but the price was a sore point,"" he said. ""Popcorn was another 500 rupees, so I skipped it."" He's not alone. Rising ticket and snack prices mean moviegoers are cutting down on their trips to cinema and moving towards cheaper streaming options. Harsh Verma, 38, looks back on a time when going to the movies didn't feel like a luxury. ""Some 15 years ago, my friends and I would go and watch every new release, sometimes every week. That has now become impossible."" In the past five years, data shows that the average cost of a film ticket in India has risen by 47%. The Average Ticket Price (ATP) in 2020 was 91 rupees, while in 2024 it rose to 134, according to audience research firm Ormax media . However, between 2023 and 2024 there was only a 3% rise in the ATP - suggesting that the prices have stabilised. The report adds that footfall in Indian cinemas has reduced by 6% in 2024 as compared to 2023, continuing a trend in recent years. One of the main reasons why going to movies has become expensive is because single-screen theatres that offered cheaper tickets have now been mostly replaced by plush multi-screen cinemas that offer a host of amenities. But multiplex owners argue that ticket prices are reasonable and that audiences continue to visit in large numbers. Bloomberg via Getty Images People say popcorn and cola combo often costs more than the movie ticket Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, executive director of multiplex chain PVR INOX Limited which owns more than 1,500 screens across India, told the BBC that the perception that people have stopped going to theatres is ""a general notion squeezed in without fact-checking"". He says his chain has recorded a footfall of 151 million in 2024, up from 140 million in 2023 and the numbers have been promising for this year as well. Mr Bijli acknowledges receiving some feedback about high ticket prices, but says that audiences continue to turn up because they get ""value for money"" - provided a film is good. ""People walk out after three hours feeling satisfied, they've enjoyed themselves in air-conditioned comfort, with superior sound and an immersive experience."" Mr Bijli says many chains like his are using flexible pricing and weekday offers to attract audiences - for instance, tickets at PVR cost only 92 rupees on Tuesdays. Some Indian states have, however, also placed a cap on ticket prices, sparking a debate on whether this needs to be a nationwide regulation. Mr Bijli argues that price caps don't help them, as steady revenue is vital to maintain and upgrade facilities. Film critic Komal Nahta believes that while lower prices could attract more audiences, owners must retain the freedom to keep their businesses profitable. But, he adds that ticket rates shouldn't be so high that the masses are priced out. ""After all, it's the people who make the stars,"" he says. Hindustan Times via Getty Images Delhi's iconic single-screen Regal Theatre permanently closed operations in 2017 Meanwhile, experts says that even though single screens offer cheaper tickets, many urban middle-class audiences no longer choose them because they cannot match the comfort and amenities of multiplexes. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" says Nahta. ""Because footfalls are low, cinema owners can't afford proper maintenance. And since the theatres aren't well maintained, people don't want to watch movies there."" In Delhi, only a handful of single screens still stand. The rest have either shut down or fallen into disrepair, their ageing structures and outdated facilities a reminder of a bygone era. Some patrons, however, remember single screens as simpler, more community spaces. ""There would be 800 to 1,000 people packed in together,"" recalls 61-year-old Renu Bhushan. ""The crowd would erupt when the star appeared on screen while vendors sold cheap snacks and drinks."" But this nostalgia is not shared by everyone. Mr Verma, says after visiting both single screens and multiplexes over the past two decades, he prefers the latter. ""The seats [at single screens] are uncomfortable and the experience isn't great,"" he says. Annu Gupta also prefers multiplexes because they offer better facilities, clean toilets and security. Industry experts say theatres are also facing competition from cheaper streaming options which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic. As audiences kept away, many theatres went out of business. ""With affordable subscriptions, people now watch most big releases within six-to-eight weeks at their homes,"" says film trade expert and marketing analyst Girish Wankhede. A monthly subscription to a streaming platform costs less than two tickets in a multiplex. For families, the math is even clearer. But Mr Bijli of PVR says that with the pandemic a distant memory now, the audience behaviour is shifting again and people are returning to theatres. Cinema and streaming are meant to co-exist and this isn't the first time the industry has faced existential questions, he says. ""Cinema has faced challenges from TV, VHS and DVDs. Every time a new content medium emerged, people wrote off cinema, but it survived. ""It offers an immersive, uninterrupted experience that you simply can't get at home.""

4db396a330ee,"'Chinese stole secrets' and 'Andrew, Epstein and me'",,"'Chinese stole secrets' and 'Andrew, Epstein and me' The main headline on the Times reads: ""Whitehall data breach gave secrets to Chinese"", as it reports that China obtained ""vast amounts"" of classified government information via a compromised network used to transfer data across Whitehall. Dominic Cummings, who served as senior adviser to Boris Johnson, told the paper that he and the then-prime minister were ""informed about the breach"" in 2020 but said that there was a ""cover-up"". The paper says the breach has been confirmed by two other Whitehall sources. The Cabinet Office has said it is ""untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised"". There is ""fresh pressure"" on the prime minister following the claims from Cummings, says the Mail, which writes that Sir Keir Starmer was also battling claims that the government played a role in the collapse of the case against two men accused of spying for China. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against the two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, both of whom deny the allegations. The Telegraph also leads on the quotes from Cummings, and says it was ""unclear"" whether the current government was made aware of the breach when they came to power last year. The paper adds that his allegations have raised fresh questions over ""why the government has not designated Beijing as a national security threat to the UK in the Chinese spy case"". It notes that on Wednesday night the government published statements provided by the government in the case ""amid mounting political pressure"". A photo of 16-year-old Virginia Giuffre also features on the front page, ahead of the the posthumous publication of Guiffre's book, Nobody's Girl, next week. The Daily Express picks up on comments from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions earlier on Wednesday, when she declared the collapse of the spy trial ""stinks of a China cover-up"". The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing. However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time. In response to her comments at PMQs, Sir Keir said the government would publish evidence submitted in the now-collapsed case. The Guardian notes that on Wednesday evening Downing Street released three witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser that were submitted in the now-collapsed case. Its main headline is: ""Budget will raise taxes on wealthy to fix public finances"", after Chancellor Rachel Reeves spoke on Wednesday at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The chancellor told the paper that there ""won't be a return to austerity"" when ""hinting"" at tax increases for wealthier Britons, despite previously ruling out imposing a ""wealth tax"" in her upcoming Budget. The i Paper is leading with an exclusive on a leaked memo, which they allege reveals plans by Labour to ""slash the affordable homes target"" in London. The paper says that developers could only be required to to hit a 20% target, instead of the current 35%, which housing experts warn is ""a huge blow to social housing"" with a ""ripple effect across the UK"". Financiers have sounded the alarm on the ""erosion of lending standards"", according to the Financial Times. The paper said that credit markets have been ""shaken"" following the collapse of First Brands Group and Tricolour holdings, following years of lenders ""searching out riskier borrowers"". The Thursday edition of the Sun marks one year since the death of One Direction star Liam Payne, featuring ""haunting"" photographs that the paper alleges were taken hours before the singer's death. ""£145m owed... not a penny paid back"" alleges the Mirror, amid reports that PPE Medpro failed to meet their Wednesday deadline to repay damages after it was found to have breached a Covid-19 personal protective equipment contact. The paper said that Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting has vowed to go after the company ""with everything we've got"". The Metro has led with a story about a 42-year-old Polish woman who has been found ""emaciated"" in her parent's apartment after vanishing ""without a trace"" 27 years ago. The paper says that an investigation is ongoing, but no charges have been laid. The Star reports that media personality and model Katie Price has alleged she was raped by a ""well-known British TV star"", who she named at a stage show on Tuesday evening. The government's publication of the advice in the collapsed China spying case came too late for many of the early editions, but the Guardian saw the documents - and says that while the third statement was similar to the language sought by prosecutors, they did not think it was sufficient to allow the case to proceed.  The paper says the Director of Public Prosecutions told senior MPs that the statements were ""five per cent less than the evidence threshold that was needed."" The Times says the documents are likely to intensify questions among MPs about why the prosecution did not go ahead. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the Guardian that people should take scaremongering about her upcoming budget with a pinch of salt. ""Of course we're looking at tax and spending,"" the Daily Mirror quotes her as saying - in what it calls her ""clearest hint yet about her plans."" The Times adds that she has vowed to increase taxes on the wealthy, rather than cut public spending. The Daily Mail says she blames Brexit, austerity, Nigel Farage and the Conservatives for the tax hikes; ""Is ANY of it your fault, Chancellor?"" it asks . The Daily Telegraph notes the International Monetary Fund is projecting that taxes will rise faster in Britain than in any other G7 country over this Parliament. Many of the papers have been reading the posthumous book by one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre. The Mail says her memoir - entitled Nobody's Girl - claims Prince Andrew thanked her after an alleged sexual encounter when she was seventeen. The Sun highlights a quote attributed to Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, who apparently told her ""You did well... the Prince had fun."" The paper says Giuffre has damned the Duke of York from beyond the grave. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied the claims against him. The i Paper says a leaked memo has revealed that Labour plans to slash affordable home targets - in a bid to revive flatlining building levels. The paper says such a move would be needed to help the government meet its pledge to build 1.5 million new homes. ""As if by magic,"" notes the Guardian , potholes were repaired in a village in Devon ahead of the filming of a new TV adaptation of the Harry Potter books there.

cf088aff7646,"The Last Dinner Party are feasting on love, death and killer riffs",,"The Last Dinner Party are feasting on love, death and killer riffs Mark Savage Music correspondent Rachell Smith The Last Dinner Party (L-R): Aurora Nishevci, Emily Roberts, Abigail Morris, Georgia Davies and Lizzie Mayland If you're the sort of person to get lost in an album, The Last Dinner Party have a treat for you. On their second record, From The Pyre, the last note of the last song segues perfectly into the opening bars of the first one. They're even in the same key (F major, musicology fans). When you listen on a loop, it draws you ever deeper into its whirlpool of dreams and nightmares and sex and death. ""That wasn't deliberate, actually, but that's really cool,"" says guitarist Emily Roberts, when it's pointed it out to her. ""Maybe, subconsciously, that's why those songs bookend the album."" As the name suggests, From The Pyre is darker, grubbier, more gothically grandiose than their critically acclaimed debut, Prelude To Ecstasy. ""It felt like there were no limits for what we could do, whether it was a really long guitar solo, or something inspired by a Bulgarian folk choir,"" says Davies. ""Confidence is the word we've thrown around as we've been writing,"" agrees singer Abigail Morris. ""We'd improved as musicians and as writers, and we wanted to be challenged."" The London-based quintet have every right to be confident. The Last Dinner Party were signed to Island Records in 2022, based on an amateur video of their fourth ever gig. They soon took over the airwaves with their first single, Nothing Matters: A sexually liberated rock anthem that was more immediate than a vodka shot on an empty stomach. After winning the BBC's Sound of 2024 , they topped the album charts, sold out three nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo and cemented their success by winning best newcomer at the Brit Awards. Performing at the ceremony, organisers wanted Emily to descend from the rafters, playing Nothing Matters' guitar solo ""like the fairy godmother who comes down in a bubble"" in David Lynch's Wild At Heart. ""Unfortunately, we ran out of time,"" the guitarist laughs. Getty Images The band won best newcomer at the 2025 Brit Awards Time is not a commodity the band have enjoyed in abundance. Since 2023, they've played 214 gigs, shot a short film, and graced the front row of Paris Fashion Week. So when on earth did they write their second album? ""We had four months at the start of this year where we didn't really play any shows,"" says bassist Georgia Davies, ""so we were recording then"". ""But when people are like, 'When did you write the album?' The answer is basically, over Christmas."" That doesn't paint the full picture, however, says Abigail. Some of the songs on From The Pyre ""have been in the dressing-up box, waiting to come out,"" since the band formed in 2021. The Scythe , a sumptuously wounded ballad released as the album's second single, goes even further back. ""I wrote the chorus when I was 16 or 17,"" says Abigail. ""I knew it was really good, but the rest of the song wasn't right, so I kept it in reserve until the right time."" Abigail originally wrote The Scythe about a teenage break-up. It was only when her sister heard it and commented on the lyrics that she realised it was really a rumination on death. ""My father passed away when I was a teenager,"" she says, ""and that kind of loss takes a long time to get your head around - even when you're in therapy and you're talking about it"". She resisted the temptation to make the lyrics more explicitly autobiographical, reasoning that grief and heartache are intrinsically linked. ""When you have a big heartbreak, in my experience, it's exactly the same bodily response as someone dying, which I think is really crazy. Your body doesn't know the difference. And that's really interesting, I think, to write about in a song."" Perhaps, I suggest, the link is especially strong for someone who's lost a parent at a young age. Every subsequent loss is refracted through that lens. ""Yeah, the body keeps score,"" she agrees. ""I think if you experience a trauma in your childhood or teenhood, it takes a really long time to repair. You might feel fine and well-adjusted and able to go through life, but you don't respond to things in the same way as someone who hasn't been through those experiences. It's all stored up on a molecular level."" Cal Macintyre The band launch their first ever UK arena tour next month As The Scythe illustrates, From The Pyre is a deeply personal record – even though the band have a tendency to self-mythologise and dress their stories in florid, theatrical outfits. It's a trait Abigail explores on the opening track, Agnus Dei, which depicts one of her exes as a heavenly apparition, descending from the clouds onto London Bridge. ""All I can give you is your name in lights for ever/ And ain't that so much better/ Than a ring on my finger? "" she croons, suggesting that being immortalised in song is vastly preferable to the mundanity of (urgh!) commitment. ""When you put someone in a song, when you make someone a muse, what does that do to them?"" she asks. ""Is it a gift or a curse to make someone live forever in a song?"" ""In a way, mythologising [the relationship] is a way of being in control of the situation, by turning them into something fictional. ""And the more you perform it, the more removed from reality it gets. The details get blurry. You can't remember what was real or what was the fable."" So, is the singer this melodramatic in her real life relationships? ""Oh! Noo- ooo! "" she replies, her laughter ripe with sarcasm, as her bandmates deliver a hasty ""no comment"". Laura Marie Cieplik The band's sense of theatricality is mirrored at their live shows, where fans often dress in elaborate costumes But melodrama is what makes The Last Dinner Party so compelling. Every song froths and foams with possibility – whether it's the razor sharp guitar riffs that suddenly appear in Second Best, or Abi's vicious put-downs ("" Your kindness didn't last beyond a fry-up"" ) in This Is The Killer Speaking . Woman Is A Tree opens with discordant harmonies, inspired by cult horror show Yellowjackets; while broiling anti-war anthem Rifles ratchets its tempo ever-upwards. Written by Georgia, the song was originally about the futility of war, but it gained fresh urgency after Israel launched its military action in Gaza – an issue on which the band have been passionately outspoken. They've called Israel's campaign ""inexcusable""; and pulled out of Portsmouth's Victorious Festival after another group was silenced for displaying a Palestinian flag on stage. Reflecting on the decision, Georgia says the group couldn't countenance ""singing Nothing Matters and dancing around in our outfits at a place where a flag is seen as an act of political violence"". ""I'm very proud that we [pulled out], because obviously it was financial loss and a massive let down to people, but it was obviously, absolutely the right thing to do."" Guitar hero Spending time with The Last Dinner Party, it's obvious that on this issue, as on everything else, they're perfectly aligned. Unlike many bands, there's no imbalance of power, no overbearing personality hoovering up the oxygen. They're a gang, a force to be reckoned with. Everyone contributes musically, with keyboard player Aurora Nischevi conducting all the orchestral arrangements, and Emily – who holds a first class jazz degree from the Guildhall School – hailed as an "" indie guitar hero ""  for her "" venomous solos "" and "" perfectly judged riffs "". ""I don't know about that,"" she blushes. ""Can you send me some of those articles?"" Getty Images Emily Roberts' style has been described as a cross between Brian May and David Bowie's 1970s sidekick, Mick Ronson From The Pyre has already received a clutch of four and five star reviews, saying its 10 songs "" add a sinister edge to their over-the-top theatrics "" that leaves their "" peers sounding listless [and] uninspired "". The songs constantly mutate, often stretching out over five minutes, in an implicit rejection of TikTok virality. ""Two minutes isn't long enough,"" protests Emily. ""We're five people. We each want to put our own stamp on the song. We like contrast in our songs, and dramatic build-ups. We couldn't do that in two minutes. It wouldn't work."" And they promise there's more to come. ""We have a Google Drive with a folder that just says, 'Ideas',"" says Abigail. ""And it's full.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lpnn2w5qjo,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dea8/live/58585f90-a9a5-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png,2025-10-16T01:43:15.479000+00:00,b642c4ff3560f395b1fb61aad3576d4da07c573b
67f27502f295,Mercury Prize: Pulp and CMAT favourites to win,,"Mercury Prize: Pulp and CMAT favourites to win Mark Savage Music correspondent Getty Images CMAT has earned two consecutive Mercury nominations - for her second album Crazymad for Me, and this year's Euro-Country Pulp and CMAT are the favourites to win this year's Mercury Prize for album of the year, which will be awarded in Newcastle on Thursday. Bookmakers say Irish singer CMAT is the front-runner with her third album, Euro-Country, which blends stories of loneliness and national identity with piercing humour. Former winners Pulp are a close second for their unexpected comeback album, More; while Irish band Fontaines DC are also in the running for Romance, which saw the alternative act cross over to the mainstream. Other nominees include pop artist PinkPantheress, singer-songwriter Jacob Alon, and folk musician Martin Carthy who, at 84, is the prize's oldest ever nominee. Carthy, who gave Bob Dylan his first tour of British folk clubs in 1962, is nominated for Transform Me Then Into a Fish, which re-evaluates his songbook from the tail end of a 60-year career. With a nod for their recent album, 2025's The Clearing, rock band Wolf Alice have now been shortlisted for all four of their studio albums. They previously won the prize in 2018 for their second record, Visions of a Life. And hometown hero Sam Fender will be hoping for a local advantage with his third album, People Watching, a steely-eyed dissection of working-class life in the North. Getty Images Sam Fender will return home for the award ceremony in Newcastle This year sees the ceremony move from London to Newcastle, following in the footsteps of the Mobo awards, as part of a new partnership with Newcastle City Council and the North East Combined Authority. It's the first time the ceremony has taken place outside the capital since it began in 1992. Next year, the Brit Awards will also leave London, moving to Manchester. ""We've always had the aspiration to move the Mercury Prize, in particular, outside of London because it's a representation of the best music of the year from across Britain and Ireland,"" says Jo Twist, says chief executive of the BPI, which organises the Mercurys and the Brits. ""Celebrating that talent from all over the country was part of the thinking."" Highlighting recent success stories from the north-east – including Brit Award winner Jade and last year's Mercury Prize recipients English Teacher – Twist says the music industry is making a ""big push"" to decentralise. ""Talent is everywhere but opportunity isn't,"" she says. ""So it's only right that we bring these large scale shows (outside London) to show there are opportunities within the music industry without having to move city."" North-east 'overlooked' Coventry-born rapper Pa Salieu, who is also Mercury-nominated for his latest album Afrikan Alien, says the change was long overdue. ""I always heard of Mercury, growing up, but it seemed so far away, out of reach,"" he says. ""So I think the Mercury Prize should be in Coventry, in Birmingham. It should move like a tour. Let the youth feel heard."" In Newcastle, the build-up to the ceremony has included a week of fringe events, including concerts from local artists and workshops for newcomers looking for their break. Among the performers is 29-year-old Finn Forster, from Teesside, who's gone from playing pubs to supporting Stereophonics on their recent European tour. He says he's ""super grateful for how much the music industry is taking a step outside of London and the major cities"". ""The north-east has been overlooked for so long,"" he says.

cd9f66c70c72,Cabinet Office rejects Cummings' China breach claim,,"The Cabinet Office has rejected Dominic Cummings' claim that China breached high-level systems used to transfer sensitive government information. In an interview with the Times, Cummings said China obtained ""vast amounts"" of ""extremely secret"" information from the UK intelligence services and parts of Whitehall. He told the paper the breach was covered up after he was briefed on the compromised data in 2020 while a senior aide to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In response, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""It is untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised."" Cummings said China breached high-level systems used to transfer so-called Strap material, a government classification for highly sensitive intelligence data. In the interview, he said the compromised information included: ""Material from intelligence services. Material from the National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. ""Things the government has to keep secret. If they're not secret, then there are very, very serious implications for it."" He told the newspaper: ""The cabinet secretary said, 'We have to explain something; there's been a serious problem', and he talked through what this was. ""And it was so bizarre that, not just Boris, a few people in the room were looking around like this - 'Am I somehow misunderstanding what he's saying?'"" He added: ""What I'm saying is that some Strap stuff was compromised and vast amounts of data classified as extremely secret and extremely dangerous for any foreign entity to control was compromised."" Cummings also claimed the breach was covered up. ""If the MPs want to finally have an inquiry about it, I'd be happy to talk about it,"" he said. A former government security official told the BBC he was ""mystified"" by Cummings' claims. Professor Ciaran Martin became the first chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre in 2016 and stood down in August 2020. Speaking on Radio 4's The World Tonight programme, Prof Martin cast doubt on Cummings' claim that the so-called Strap system was breached. ""This is, to the best of my knowledge, categorically untrue,"" he said. ""That would have fallen to the National Cyber Security Centre to lead and there was no such investigation."" Prof Martin added: ""China is a consistent and serious cyber security threat… but these systems are entirely different. ""They're built, monitored, secured and operated in an entirely different way than normal internet-based systems. ""It doesn't follow that… they [China] can somehow penetrate these entirely bespoke systems and there wasn't any evidence in 2020 that they did so.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xz607dpro,Politics,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c52e/live/c16db960-aa29-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-16T04:19:49.383000+00:00,4d75d56a7550cc4cd59f139768e86a629f650e90

Trump told reporters he had received assurances from Modi that India would halt its purchases ""within a short period of time"", which he called ""a big stop"". A spokeswoman for the Indian embassy in Washington DC would not comment. The US president has sought to leverage India's purchases of Russian oil in his trade war, but Delhi has resisted, creating a diplomatic rift. Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. ""Now I've got to get China to do the same thing,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, as part of his administration's broader push to cut off Moscow's energy funding. The Trump administration is also pushing Japan to stop importing oil and gas from Russia, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he communicated this ""expectation"" to visiting Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato on Wednesday. India cannot ""immediately"" halt oil shipments, Trump said, adding that the shift will be ""a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon"". The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India, levies that Trump has characterised as punishment against Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons. The tariffs – which took effect in August and are among the highest in the world – include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine. Modi has for months stood his ground, arguing that India is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war despite his country's ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Reuters Trump and Modi - pictured in February - have been at loggerheads on trade Indian officials have called the Trump administration's accusations that Delhi profits from Russia's war in Ukraine a double standard, citing ongoing trade with Russia in the US and Europe. India relies on Russian crude oil, which Delhi has continued to buy at a discount, to support its economy - the fifth largest in the world. The dispute over Russian oil has strained the relationship between Trump and Modi, although the US president on Wednesday praised the Indian leader as a ""great man"".

5b45c3d3d496,The real problem with Britain's asylum hotels - and the woman with a bold idea to solve it,,"The real problem with Britain's asylum hotels - and the woman with a bold idea to solve it Tom Symonds News correspondent BBC Kate Wareing has dedicated her career to helping people who find themselves in a crisis because they have nowhere to live. It's clearly personal. She worked as a housing officer at the age of 18, remembers sleeping on a sofa herself when a relationship broke up, and now in her early 50s, feels she is only a home owner because of ""luck and age"". ""Everybody needs the security of a home,"" she says. And now Kate, who is the chief executive of an Oxfordshire housing association, has an idea that she thinks could help the government with one of its most pressing challenges: how to empty asylum hotels by 2029. The pledge was made when tensions and anger rose during the summer, in communities where some regard asylum seekers as a threat to local safety. The cost of putting asylum seekers in local hotels is also ""cripplingly expensive,"" points out Kate - and she makes a bold claim: the cost could be cut from about £54,000 a year to just £4,000, for each asylum seeker, by moving them to social housing. AFP via Getty Images Protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping Instead of paying private contractors to provide hotel rooms, as it does now, she wants the government to pay councils and housing associations to buy more properties, adding them to the nation's social housing stock, to benefit migrants and others in need of a home. The BBC has been told her proposal has been discussed with several government departments, including the Treasury and the Home Office. Officials are talking to nearly 200 councils about a series of pilot projects, though the Home Office won't give details. The question is, could it really work - if private companies haven't managed to source enough accommodation for asylum seekers, what's to say a council could? And would this plan really help to calm the strident public debate, in the wake of the protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping and elsewhere this year - or might it even exacerbate it? The pandemic fuelled the problem There is no doubt tensions have been increasing. In July 2015 a coastguard in Dover told the BBC that two migrants had been rescued from a dinghy just offshore in the Channel. It was so surprising that it made the news. At that time people typically hid in lorries to get across the Channel. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fewer lorries and would-be stowaways increasingly began using inflatable boats instead. Small boat arrivals accounted for a relatively small 4% of total immigration to the UK for the year to June 2025, but the numbers are rising. The pandemic also rapidly increased the use of hotels to house asylum seekers. Successive administrations have banned asylum seekers from working for their first year in the UK - they didn't want the opportunity for a job to become a ""pull factor"" - so it falls to the government to support them. The Conservatives turned to the private sector for help, handing contracts to three companies - Serco, Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears - to provide beds. The problem was, they ran out. Getty Images Small boat arrivals account for a relatively small percentage of total immigration to the UK Then, as lockdowns struck, hotels emptied, providing a useful source of emergency accommodation. The rooms are, however, more expensive than renting houses. In October 2025, the government was spending £5.5m per day on them. At one point, under the Conservatives, there were 400 hotels in use but they managed to reduce the number over time. While Labour has closed three hotels since July 2024, there are still 210, housing around 32,000 people. 'Put them in a camp' This summer, the argument moved to the streets, with protesters demanding the closure of asylum hotels. Lorraine Cavanagh, campaigning outside the Britannia Hotel in London's Canary Wharf, told me: ""I don't know who they are. They have no background, they have no passports, they are unidentified men who can walk around and do what they want to do with no consequences. ""Their beliefs are not the same as ours. They are coming in and trying to disturb and change things, that we are not used to."" AFP via Getty Images Several protests about asylum hotels have taken place across the country, including in Canary Wharf, London Some protesters have another suggestion: put them in a military camp. Rakib Ehsan, a senior fellow at the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank, agrees this could be useful on a temporary basis. ""At least they would be somewhat separated from local communities,"" he says. Two large former Ministry of Defence sites are currently being used for asylum seekers - Napier Barracks, near Folkestone, and a former RAF base at Wethersfield in Essex. In 2021 the High Court found Napier Barracks, which is capable of housing 300 male migrants, to be overcrowded and filthy, requiring the government to take action. The other facility, Wethersfield, which contains bedrooms, recreational areas and places for worship, is being expanded. Eventually more than 1,200 beds will be available. Residents can come and go, but the High Court was previously told Wethersfield was like a prison. Three migrants bringing a case against the former Home Secretary described ""tensions and outbreaks of violence"" within its walls. These ""large sites"" are not cheap either. The government spent £49m refurbishing Wethersfield, far more than had been estimated. A programme to open accommodation at RAF Scampton was also abandoned in 2024 after the cost ballooned to £60m. The public financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, concluded in March 2024 that these large sites would cost even more than hotels. Questioned by MPs in June 2025, the Environment Minister Angela Eagle said the government was moving away from ""asbestos-filled buildings, poisoned land, unexploded ordinance and all those sorts of things on old army bases"". Getty Images Bibby Stockholm: the vessel was controversially used to house hundreds of asylum seekers while their applications were processed until last year But then in September 2025, Defence Secretary John Healey popped up, during the wave of anti-migrant protests, and revealed he had tasked his planners with identifying more military sites. Did the need for beds become greater, or did the rhetoric around using barracks for people who claim to be fleeing persecution become more acceptable, as Reform edged up in the opinion polls? Possibly both. Plans are yet to be revealed. Either way, what the government really needs now, is lots of cheaper, and better places for them to stay. Private sector problem Hotels and military bases are used for ""emergency accommodation"" when there isn't enough so-called ""dispersal accommodation"" in communities around the country, which often takes the form of Houses in Multiple Occupation, or HMOs. This is where at least three people ""not from the same household"", live together, sharing a bathroom and a kitchen. Three main private contractors use public money to find HMOs on the open market. One, Mears, went on a spending spree across the north-east of England in 2023 and early 2024 buying 221 properties for more than £20m. But many flats and houses are rented from private landlords. Another provider, Serco, has 1,000 leased properties for asylum accommodation. The third, Clearsprings Ready Homes, has made £187m in the last six years supporting 30,000 migrants, though half of them are in hotels. So these companies are competing with all of us, and local councils, for suitable properties. Planning applications for HMO status have been rising steadily since 2009, according to the property data company Searchland, though smaller HMOs don't need planning permission. There can be public opposition to attempts to use HMOs for migrants, just as there is with hotels, which is one factor contributing to a shortage. Another is that in some areas few rental properties are available at the very low rents the government contracts will pay. Renting or buying? This could be seen as a challenge to Kate Wareing's plan for housing associations and councils to provide properties instead. If the three private companies contracted by the government struggle, won't councils and housing associations have the same problem? ""We would shop in a different way,"" she says. Often the asylum accommodation companies are looking for the cheapest private rented houses, usually in areas with lots of asylum seekers already, she says, fuelling community tensions. But councils and housing associations could plan more carefully where to go shopping, she argues, and there are other sources of property they might be able to get hold of more easily. For example, they could buy up property in housing developments. Builders usually have to offer social housing as part of any new development, in order to get planning permission. There has been a drop in first-time buyers recently. Under Kate Wareing's plan, the government would give a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property ""We've got builders approaching us asking if we want to buy more homes on some new-build sites than we would normally be being offered,"" she says, estimating that might make another 5,000 properties available in the next few years. Her housing authority alone buys 20 a year, and purchases would be spread across the country. Other experts the BBC spoke to thought this was a reasonable target. In outline, her plan would work like this: the government gives a council or housing association an average of £80,000 to buy and do up a property. They would also need to borrow some money on top of that, but the interest they pay is usually less than a company would. These properties would be used for current social housing tenants, and when they move out of their existing houses, asylum seekers would move in - after any necessary repairs had been made - with the government paying their rent to the councils and associations to cover their costs. ""We'll have 10 new houses that we can use to relieve some of the needs of our existing residents and then we can also move asylum seekers into any houses that they are vacating,"" she argues. In the longer term, ""there will be 10 more houses to let to the local population or to use for other types of homelessness need."" She calculates an investment of £1.75bn could enable the purchase and renovation of 14,000 to 16,000 homes. The costs of rent would be similar to the cost of the housing benefit asylum seekers are not allowed to claim. Her analysis was checked by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which has its own model for assessing development opportunities being considered by housing associations. They said it ""stood up fine"". 'An asylum system in chaos' Rakib Ehsan of Policy Exchange argues there should be more social housing, but for British citizens not asylum seekers. But Kate Wareing says that under her plan, there would be homes for both. Rakib Ehsan also emphasises the concerns some people have over public safety, as long as most migrants continue to be young men from ""deeply patriarchal societies"". ""If we look at the demographic characteristics associated with small boat migrants in particular who went to the UK, they tend to originate from parts of the world which have a very different view when it comes to the treatment of women and girls,"" he says. But Kate believes her plan would be politically acceptable, because it makes newly refurbished homes available for local people who need them. Plus she argues asylum seekers could end up sharing a home with others in need, potentially reducing social tensions. Getty Images Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, is being expanded If the government wants to change tack, it has a chance next year, when there is a break point in the 10-year contracts with the three asylum housing providers. John Perry, policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Housing says: ""That's why this idea has currency. It is very encouraging local authorities appear to want to work with the government."" There is a risk, though, that a version of Kate Wareing's plan would take too long to put into effect, if it is to help the government meet its 2029 deadline. The Home Office insists the government inherited ""an asylum system in chaos"" and that it has reduced the backlog of claims by 24%, returned 35,000 people ""with no right to be here"", and cut hotel spending by over half a billion pounds. ""We are looking at a range of more sustainable, cost-effective and locally led sites including disused accommodation, industrial and ex-military sites, so we can reduce the impact on communities and taxpayers,"" a spokesperson said. If the government can meet its pledge to close the asylum hotels, the prize would be saving of £1bn per year, according to the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. But failure would give the government's main opponent, Reform, a big stick with which to beat it, at the next election. This issue could help decide the outcome.

3392296368fc,'Hosting Prince William was a whirlwind experience',,"'Hosting Prince William was a whirlwind experience' Kensington Palace Rhian Mannings invited Prince William to her home in Cardiff to discuss her husband's suicide A widow who had tea with the Prince of Wales at her home in Cardiff to discuss her husband's suicide called it a ""whirlwind experience"". In an emotional conversation , Rhian Mannings told Prince William how her husband, Paul, died by suicide just five days after they lost their one-year-old son, George in 2012. She later founded a bereavement charity - which has now been supported by a £1m donation from Prince William's Royal Foundation to create a UK suicide prevention network. Ms Mannings said it was ""really special"" and ""meant the world"" to welcome the future King into the family home she once shared with Paul and George. In a conversation filmed by Kensington Palace for World Mental Health Day, the prince asked Ms Mannings about how she had coped, how she continued raising two children, whether she had faced stigma around suicide at the time and what she would say to her husband now. At one point, Prince William was visibly moved and appeared too emotional to speak. He spoke of his commitment to ""building a bold, unified national response to the heartbreaking and preventable tragedy of suicide"". Kensington Palace Despite being unsure how the act with the future King, she says the atmosphere was ""incredibly relaxed"", with ""a lot of hugs"" Ms Mannings first received an email from Kensington Palace inviting her to Windsor Castle to discuss suicide - which she said was ""surreal in the first place"". But soon after, another message came through: Prince William wanted to visit her at home. ""To be honest, I just laughed,"" she said. ""I was giggling, thinking, this can't be serious. I thought they meant Cardiff - not my actual house."" When it was confirmed, Ms Mannings felt a mix of emotions, ""amazing, nerve-wracking, exciting"". She added: ""It's a difficult subject that we were going to talk about as well, so obviously it was going to be emotive. ""For him to come into my home, where I lived with Paul and George - there's something really special about that. It felt like he was stepping into my life."" Rhian Mannings Ms Mannings' husband, Paul, died by suicide just five days after the death of their one-year-old son, George Ms Mannings said she had met Prince William a few times before and had spoken about ""emotional things"" so she knew the conversation ""wasn't going to be easy"". ""Talking about suicide and loss never is - but I was surprised by how hard he found it."" ""Seeing him upset at my kitchen table was tough. ""Normally, you'd give someone a big cwtch, but he's the future king - I wasn't sure what I could do."" Despite the emotion, she said the atmosphere was ""incredibly relaxed"", with ""lots of hugs"" and hand-holding throughout. ""It was lovely to see how much it mattered to him - not just hearing our story, but looking at how we stop this happening to other families. ""He is obviously very passionate about that, and that came across in bucketloads."" Prince William stayed for over an hour and ""never looked at his watch"" and even chatted with her as he got into the car, Ms Mannings said. Her children, Holly, 17, and Isaac, 16, were surprised by how ""normal"" he was. Ms Mannings explained how they said: ""That was weird - he's just so normal. ""He spoke to them like someone we knew. He makes it very easy to forget who he is. ""It was a very special day."" Ms Mannings also shared how her mum, Chris Jones, 78, wanted to make the prince a Victoria sponge and some Welsh cakes. But with the conversation running long, they didn't get round to it - so as he left, they offered to send them home for George, Charlotte and Louis. He accepted - and left with the cakes packed in one of Ms Jones' tupperware boxes. Kensington Palace Ms Mannings says her children, Holly and Isaac, were surprised by how ""normal"" the prince was After her own loss, Ms Mannings founded a charity, 2wish, to help those affected by the sudden or unexpected death of a child or young person. That charity will be one of 20 organisations that will form part of a new National Suicide Prevention Network, being launched with £1m over three years, from the Royal Foundation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The network will be chaired by Professor Ann John, an expert in the prevention of suicide and consultant in public health medicine in Wales. It will try to understand more about the causes of suicide, to provide support that can be accessed by anyone, and to encourage more collaboration between different agencies and charities. Ms Mannings said she ""never, ever in a million years"" expected the overwhelming response to the conversation and that at 2wish, they had been ""inundated with families seeking support and wanting to know more"". She explained how her main reason for sharing her story was to show that ""it's important to talk about suicide and not be scared of the word"" - and that ""anything is possible"". ""The message really is that people need to talk,"" she said. ""Whether it's talking about struggles or just your day - reaching out helps, even though it's not always easy."" Ms Mannings reflected on how people often ask ""are you OK?"" - but it's a vague question, easy to ""fob off"". ""Sometimes it's better to offer to go for a walk or just spend time with someone who might just need a little bit of company. ""I so wish Paul had spoken to me that weekend. He didn't. And I just know that if we had just sat down and talked, things would have been OK.

1b00bb64156b,Digesting the key segments and changes in China documents,,"Digesting the key segments and changes in China documents Chris Mason Political editor Reuters At just after half past nine on Wednesday night, the documents appeared on the government's website. There were three submissions from one of the government's Deputy National Security Advisers, Matthew Collins. The first one from December 2023, under the Conservatives. And two more. The second one is dated February 2024, also when the Conservatives were in power and the third August 2025, when Labour were. But it turns out, we learned in a later hastily published clarification, the date was a year out in that second document and it was actually submitted in February 2025, under Labour – arguably a crucial distinction when one element of the language used is examined. Firstly, then, to the first document. It includes lots of detail relating to the specific allegations against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who have always denied the allegations against them and who are not facing any criminal proceedings. Mr Cash, through his solicitor, has already put out a statement reiterating his innocence and reflecting that he hadn't had ""the daylight of a public trial"" and adding that he shouldn't have to take part ""in a trial by media."" In the first document, Mr Collins sets out that the government at the time saw China as an ""evolving and epoch defining challenge"". That was the language government ministers were always careful to use at the time. It adds that the government ""will increase our national security protections where Chinese state actions pose a threat to our people, prosperity and security"". There is then a segment that is a little warmer towards Beijing: ""We will engage directly with China bilaterally and in international fora so that we leave room for open, constructive and predictable relations."" But it is blunt, too: ""The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interests."" He concludes: ""It is my assessment that the suspects' alleged activities were prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK, and the information and material passed would be directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state."" So, he talks about espionage, he talks about threats and he talks too about being open and constructive. Fast forward to February of this year and the language is similar, but it does appear to reflect the change in government and its outlook on relations with China. Mr Collins says China presents ""the biggest state based threat to the UK's economic security"" but adds a few paragraphs later ""it is important for me to emphasise, however, that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China. The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised."" That word ""positive"" hadn't featured in the earlier document. And then in the final submission, from just a few months ago in August of this year, the word ""positive"" features again, but so does this: ""China's espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience and the integrity of our democratic institutions."" And, crucially, he points out that between 2021 and 2023, the crucial years under the last government when these allegations relate to, ""the UK government publicly articulated…the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK"". The BBC understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue, when he submitted that third and final witness statement. We are also told that after submitting his first statement, when the Crown Prosecution Service went back to him to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, they were not explicitly clear what Mr Collins would have needed to say in order to clear that threshold. So what can we deduce from all of this? This government and its Conservative predecessor had a deep and ongoing worry about Chinese espionage. But both also wanted an economic and diplomatic relationship with Beijing. Labour folk tell me it justifies the prime minister's argument – as punchy a case as could be made was made, within the confines of government policy a few years ago and now. Some Conservative folk note Mr Collins' language in the submissions since the general election quote language that featured in Labour's manifesto: ""We will cooperate where we can, compete where we need to and challenge where we must."" The Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told me: ""This is wholly contrary to what the prime minister has been saying – which is that all of the evidence submitted related to the 2021-2023 period."" We await Downing Street's response. And one final thing. There are MPs digesting all of this who are struggling to understand why this case didn't come to court. It is the Crown Prosecution Service's role to judge the likelihood of securing a conviction and in this instance they didn't think that likelihood was high enough – and it is their job to determine that.

f6e750264977,S Korea tycoon escapes paying $1bn in 'divorce of the century',,"South Korea's Supreme Court has struck down a lower court's order for billionaire Chey Tae-won to pay his ex-wife a 1.38tn won ($1bn; £788m) settlement, in a case dubbed by local media as the ""divorce of the century"". Citing a miscalculation that increased the value of the couple's assets, it has ordered the case to be reviewed. The case has gripped South Korea as Mr Chey heads the powerful SK Group conglomerate while his ex-wife Roh So-young is the daughter of a former president. The marriage unravelled in 2015 after Mr Chey admitted to fathering a child with his lover. The 1.38 trillion won payout was decided by a court in the capital Seoul in 2024 . It was considered the largest divorce settlement in South Korea's history at the time. The court said a 30bn won slush fund by Ms Roh's father, former president Roh Tae-woo, had helped contribute to the growth of SK Group and could be considered as her contribution to the couple's joint assets. Mr Chey then appealed the settlement. On Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that the slush fund ""appeared to have originated from bribes illegally received"" by the former president and thus could not be considered part of the couple's assets. ""I think it is very significant that the Supreme Court clearly declared that it was wrong to recognise that as a contribution to the couple's joint property,"" said Mr Chey's lawyer, Lee Jae-geun. However, the Supreme Court upheld a 2bn won alimony payment for Ms Roh. Shares of SK fell 5.4% after the ruling on Thursday, as it was seen to prolong Mr Chey's legal battle with his ex-wife. But in the short term analysts believe a shake-up at SK Group is unlikely, as Mr Chey is not immediately compelled to raise funds for his divorce settlement. He controls key subsidiaries of the group such as SK Telecom, SK Square and SK Innovation. SK's businesses span the telecommunications, energy, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor sectors.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drpd1pwrno,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99d8/live/e0430f20-aa42-11f0-ac6d-71d5e12379f0.jpg,2025-10-16T06:07:49.132000+00:00,2ffa6883a8779e1ba995698655fd8a09ef5c4002
2b09002d208a,India's exports to US plunge as Trump's 50% tariffs kick in,,"India's goods exports to the US, its largest foreign market, dropped sharply by 20% in September and nearly 40% in the last four months, as Trump's steep tariffs took effect, data shows. September was the first full month of Washington's 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which kicked in on 27 August. This includes a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia. ""US has become India's most severely affected market since the tariff escalation began,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank. Negotiations for a trade deal between the two countries are under way, with the goal of concluding an agreement by next month. According to GTRI, the most significant impact of the tariffs has been felt by labour-heavy sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and chemicals, which have suffered the heaviest losses. Shipments to the US have seen four consecutive months of decline, and are down 37.5% - from $8.8bn (£6.5bn) in May to $5.5bn in September. The drop in exports have also contributed to India's trade deficit (the gap between what a country imports and exports), which widened to a 13-month high of $32.15 billion in September. Some of the reduction in exports to the US was cushioned by improved trade with countries like the UAE and China. Trade negotiations between India and the US resumed last month after months of stalling over a number of differences. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for  talks. On Wednesday, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil , as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine. A spokesperson of the Indian foreign ministry said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". But major sticking points over trade still remain, including access to agriculture and dairy. For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and the interests of millions of small farmers. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.

Shelvey spent longer at Newcastle than any other side - seven years in total following his move from Swansea City - and said he was ""honoured"" to have represented the club and worn the captain's armband on occasion. As well as sticking around following relegation, in 2016, and playing his part in taking Newcastle straight back up, Shelvey also helped ensure the club then stayed in the top flight.

367f8c1fac46,"Use of Jesus Army's fortune is appalling, says victims' lawyer",,"Use of Jesus Army's fortune is appalling, says victims' lawyer Jon Ironmonger BBC Investigations DocsvilleStudios/BBC Archive A lawyer representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army said plans to allow people accused of child abuse to receive a share of the cult's fortune were ""shameful"". A BBC investigation revealed 172 former loyal members of the disgraced Northamptonshire-based evangelical sect would receive much larger payouts than those awarded to victims under a redress scheme. It is understood some who have been people accused of perpetrating or covering up abuse could be among the beneficiaries of the group's assets - which is estimated to be more £50m - a prospect survivors have described as ""sickening"". Malcolm Johnson, a lawyer from Lime Solicitors, said the only right action to take was redirect the leftover assets for charitable use. A spokesperson for the Jesus Fellowship Community Trust (JFCT), which is winding up the group's affairs, said the identities of the fund's beneficiaries were not being disclosed to protect the privacy of victims who made their allegations in confidence. He insisted the trustees had consulted with Mr Johnson over a long period of time and had no powers to redirect the assets. Under a court order, anyone with unresolved claims against the JFCT must have made an application by 16 October, otherwise they will have permanently lost the ability to do so. How has the Jesus Army's fortune been spent? New Creation Hall, the birthplace of the Jesus Fellowship community, is among dozens of properties that have been sold over the past few years Over 50 years the Jesus Fellowship acquired dozens of large houses and successful businesses, paid for by its 3,500 community members who often put everything they earned and owned into a trust. Documents seen by the BBC reveal the group's assets in 2017 were valued at £58.6m. When the trust closed in 2020, the assets were liquidated and about £25m was divided among the remaining 172 members - known as listed beneficiaries - in the form of relief of need, or return of capital. Beneficiaries have also reported receiving a lump sum of £63,000. Last year the trust compensated 601 victims who say they suffered sexual, physical and emotional abuse in the Jesus Fellowship, with individuals receiving about £13,000 each on average. The damages were partly paid for by insurers and court papers show £25m remains in the trust, which will now also be shared among the listed beneficiaries. It would mean about 10% of the Jesus Fellowship's total assets have been spent on victims, though the trustees insisted the true figure was closer to 20%. Escape responsibility Malcolm Johnson from Lime Solicitors helped 150 victims to claim damages Mr Johnson told the BBC the abuse endured by his clients was ""truly harrowing"". He said he was aware of no action being taken by the church against many of the alleged perpetrators, some of whom were long-standing members. ""The news [some people accused of abuse] could end up with more remuneration than their victims is appalling. ""It is a shameful example of how cults like the Jesus Army escape responsibility for their alleged crimes,"" Mr Johnson added. The JFCT trustees said all allegations made during the redress scheme had been reported to the police, who were the only party able to take any action. A review of damages claims carried out by the JFCT identified 539 alleged abusers within the sect - about one fifth of the total membership - including 162 former leaders. About ten former members who have been convicted of offences in community houses are understood to be precluded from the distribution of assets. BBC/Docsville Studios/Alamy At least 60 more potential victims have come forward since the broadcast of the BBC documentary, Inside the Cult of the Jesus Army Since the broadcast of a BBC documentary, Inside the Cult of the Jesus Army, Kathleen Hallisey, a lawyer from Scott-Moncrieff and Associates, says she has taken on about 60 new clients who are pursuing claims. They include eight women who were known as domestic sisters. ""If you were a married woman in the Jesus Fellowship you had to work as a domestic sister and were forced to cook, wash and clean every day for a large house full of men, as well bring up your own children. ""In a modern slavery context, I believe it amounts to exploitation because if you don't perform this unpaid job, you have to leave the community destitute with no money or support."" Ms Hallisey said many of the new claimants she has spoken to suffered breakdowns or tried to take their own lives. She said one woman, who left the community in 2014, prepped lunch for 38 people while heavily pregnant and gave birth that afternoon. The trustees of the JFCT have publicly apologised for the abuse that occurred within the church and said all allegations had been reported to the police. ""The trustees have recognised the importance of meaningfully engaging with not just the listed beneficiaries, but with others who have an interest in the winding up."" The spokesperson said it was misleading to present the beneficiaries of the trust as the perpetrator group with a bright line between the victims, and insisted the position was much more complex.

8fd3cf5797a1,"Titan submersible imploded due to poor engineering, say US officials",,"Titan submersible imploded due to poor engineering, say US officials American Photo Archive OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report. Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was ""inadequate"", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements. The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage. Titan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was ""preventable"" and criticised OceanGate's ""critically flawed"" safety practices. Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive, operated the Titan on its final journey. The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding. During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate. While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment ""where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored"". One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as ""mission specialists"" as opposed to passengers. Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible. The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: ""… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation."" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: ""If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeg7y4171xo,World (International),BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0ac/live/c7a68410-aa5b-11f0-9d87-a79f167250e5.jpg,2025-10-16T08:00:24.876000+00:00,998687ba634da2ccaa13414eee52c5f34ac597d6

48213f397b5e,Artificial reef created at offshore wind farm,,"Artificial reef created at offshore wind farm Fiona Irving South East environment correspondent BBC The artificial reef covers 820 sq m around the base of a Rampion wind turbine One of the largest artificial reefs in the world has been installed at a wind farm off the Sussex coast. The project at the Rampion Offshore Wind Farm is the first of its kind, with 75,000 specially designed ""reef cubes"" placed at the bottom of a single turbine. It is part of a nature-inclusive design project, with the cubes helping to protect the turbine from erosion while also serving as a home for a wide range of marine life. Helen Elphick, an innovations partner at RWE, the company that operates Rampion, said it was exciting to be involved in a trial which was a ""sustainable win-win"". Samuel Hickling holds a replica reef cube made of low-carbon concrete The reef cubes have been designed with a chamber in the middle and a honeycomb texture on the outside to encourage marine life to use them. Samuel Hickling, the chief scientific officer at ARC Marine, said the intention was to ""replicate the complexity that you get in a natural reef, so you can get reef building species settling on it"". It is hoped species such as ross worms, anemones, oysters and mussels will live on the reef cubes and that fish and crustaceans will also come over time. More than 100 of the cubes have already been used at a scallop farm in Torbay. However, the sheer scale of the 75,000 cubes installed at Rampion, over an 820 sq m (8,826sq ft) site, means this trial is far bigger. ARC Marine A lobster hides in the chamber of a reef cube placed off the coast of Torbay in 2021 Sea currents speed up as they pass around the base of a wind turbine and can cause erosion, so scour pads - made up of rocks - are often installed around the foot of offshore turbines. This pilot project is looking at ways to replace the rocks with a nature-friendly artificial reef. ""We need to put scour protection down around our turbines and this kind of a solution both achieves that but it also provides extra habitats for marine species,"" said Ms Elphick. ""It's a real sustainable win-win."" Helen Elphick says the cubes ""can be locally manufactured providing jobs as well"" The low carbon reef cubes are made near Truro from recycled waste aggregate from Cornish clay mines. A crane placed the cubes into a hopper which then saw them fed through a pipe 25m (82ft) down to the sea floor, a process which took two days. The project, which took eight years to get off the ground, will be studied for five years to see how effective it is at protecting the turbine from erosion and how bio-diverse it becomes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr1mgmz44ko,Science,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f0af/live/0869adb0-a9df-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg,2025-10-16T05:19:46.468000+00:00,8b92f9be0cb98e97dd0760f8637553d7bcb69389
e21cb8118f40,Why Man Utd's next four games could shape their season,,"Ruben Amorim should be looking ahead to Manchester United's return to Premier League action this weekend with a renewed sense of optimism. Yet four huge games now await United, starting at Liverpool. They could shape how this season turns out for the team, for better or worse. Amorim's side produced one of the most solid performances of his time in charge by beating Sunderland 2-0 immediately before the international break. The result eased pressure that had been mounting on the Portuguese head coach in the aftermath of a woeful defeat at Brentford the week before. Since then, minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has backed Amorim, talking in terms of it taking three years for the former Sporting coach to make his mark at Old Trafford - and reminding supporters how long it took Sir Alex Ferguson to navigate choppy waters following his arrival at the club in 1986. However, Amorim knows few will take Ratcliffe's words at face value if the team fail to make meaningful progress on last season's 15th place, United's worst top-flight finish since the 1973-74 relegation season. The Sunderland win lifted United to 10th, only the second time this season they have ended a match round in the top half of the table. It was just their 10th victory in 34 Premier League games since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in November last year. They are still to win two successive league games. United could not have a much tougher assignment on Sunday than Liverpool at Anfield (16:30 BST), where they have not won since 2016 and, until last season, had scored once in eight visits. Few think United will return from Merseyside with three points. In terms of expectation, it is the fixtures after that where the real peril comes - Brighton at home, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away. In theory it is a good chance to pick up a decent points haul and push up the table towards the European places. In the dressing room and the boardroom, this is United's stated aim this season and would prove progress has been made. Yet, in each of the past two seasons, United have lost at home against Brighton and away at the City Ground and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Last term, Amorim was in charge for each of them. Below is a list of the upcoming fixtures and a look at what happened in 2024-25, with Amorim's post-match assessments and fan verdicts.

59ddb36b075a,Why WSL clubs are signing up Japan's best talent,,"A large part of Blayney's role is to travel to England and spend weeks at a time analysing the performances of Japan's players.3 She also provides player care - helping them manage language barriers, settle into new cities and link them up with other Japanese players in the league. In the week she spoke to BBC Sport, she had attended games at Brighton, Manchester United and Liverpool. She saw Risa Shimizu score for Liverpool in their Women's League Cup win over Sunderland and Miyazawa dominate in United's 3-0 win over Brann in Europe. ""Since January, I have been immersed in England quite frequently. I've been collaborating with coaches directly and that's been excellent for Japan,"" Blayney said. ""They live on the other side of the world, away from home and their families. Sometimes just having a familiar face is important. ""I was a former player who lived abroad so I understand the challenges. I always let the players know I'm coming to their games, but not Aoba Fujino because her face when she sees me always makes me smile."" With so many Japanese stars in the WSL, clubs are introducing ways to help them settle, providing translation services and offering English speaking lessons. Manchester City cook Asian-themed meals before matchdays and allow their Japanese players to return later in the winter break so they can celebrate new year with families back home. As a result, the WSL is an attractive destination for Japan's top stars and their emerging generation, and Blayney hopes more will make the move in the future.

a094def12f1b,Still no Salah but make room for Eze - FPL team of the week,,"Eberechi Eze, Arsenal, Â£7.6m - Fulham (a) With Martin Odegaard set for a spell on the sidelines, Eze looks set for an extended run in the Arsenal side and that makes him a very intriguing FPL option. He tops most underlying statistics for Arsenal midfielders. His 17 shots translates to an average of 3.85 shots per 90 minutes - Bukayo Saka is next best at 2.33 - and 11 of those have been in the box. Bear in mind he is yet to score and you could say ""he's due""! Eze has been involved in 38% of Arsenal's goals when he's on the pitch, which is huge in an Arsenal side with so many good players. Involved, playing well and a good price. Get him on your radar. Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, Â£7.9m - Crystal Palace (a) This slot is reserved for Semenyo until further notice. Palace away is not the easiest game but he might just be fixture proof. Jaidon Anthony, Burnley, Â£5.7m - Leeds (h) Leeds are a side you can target away from home, where their expected goals conceded (xGC) is more than double their record at Elland Road - 5.5 to 2.3. Four-goal Anthony is proving to be Burnley's best goal threat and is a nice price if you are looking for a rotatable fifth midfielder. These are the kind of games you play him in - home to a fellow promoted side - and Burnley have a point to prove after a poor start. Jeremy Doku, Manchester City, Â£6.6m - Everton (h) Doku is a bit of a minutes risk but his past two home games have each resulted in 10-point hauls. Behind Haaland, he is City's most creative player so far - involved in 27% of the team's goals when on the pitch. With his explosive pace, you'd fancy him to have joy against Everton's Jake O'Brien who, despite playing well this season, is still a 6ft 6in centre-back playing as a full-back. Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea, Â£6.7m - Nottingham Forest (a) Cole Palmer's injury is bad news for Chelsea but good news for Fernandez's FPL value as he is likely to continue playing in an advanced role. Among all players in the league he has the fourth-highest xG so far at 3.66, and the second-highest among midfielders. We're raving about Semenyo, whose xG is mildly better at 3.73, so does this make Fernandez the next best midfield pick? He's had eight shots in the box, six big chances, three goals. With better finishing he'd have more and is also on penalties. Keep an eye on his injury status.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8x1ejg58v1o,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/f060/live/ac4844a0-a93a-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,2025-10-16T07:41:13.241000+00:00,aebaca8887307a3b5c6c0ae4a2fae688f2d6f556

Pulev, 44, was ordered to defend his secondary WBA belt against 20-year-old Itauma but has agreed to face former cruiserweight world champion Gassiev instead. Queensberry's Frank Warren, who promotes Itauma, said earlier this week that his team were ""pursuing"" a fight with the Bulgarian. But Pulev's promoter Ivaylo Gotzev, who is the CEO of Epic Sports and Entertainment, said the WBA has agreed to let the veteran make a voluntary defence.

In August, the RFEF approved plans for the game that had been due to be hosted at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica to instead take place at Hard Rock Stadium on 20 December. Real Madrid expressed opposition, stating the consequences would be ""so serious"" and lead to a ""before and after"" for the world of football. Confirmation of the Miami game followed a decision by the Italian football federation (FIGC) to sanction a Serie A match between AC Milan and Como to be played in Perth, Australia in February. ""It's a reward for those fans who are behind the screen, also in Asia or America, who are paying a fee to watch all the Spanish La Liga matches. It's a gesture to them,"" Louzan said. ""It's good for football and it promotes the Spanish La Liga around the world. Italy is also going to do it with Serie A in Australia. It's a good move for the best league in the world to do it."" European football's governing body Uefa was in ""clear opposition"" to the plans but ""reluctantly"" gave approval because there was no legal framework to stop it. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said it was a ""regrettable"" decision to allow two European league matches to be played overseas and insisted it ""shall not be seen as setting a precedent"". Barcelona's greatest ever player, Lionel Messi, has made Miami his home since joining Inter Miami in 2023 following a two-season spell at Paris St-Germain. Joan Laporta, Barcelona's president, said when the fixture was announced: ""A competitive game in a city like Miami, with a large FC Barcelona following, will definitely be a great show.""

0564875a2c5b,'Shout out to my ex' - why clubs are turning to former bosses,,"So, why go back? For some it's a case of heart over head. Steve Cotterill returned to hometown club Cheltenham Town after 23 years last month. The 61-year-old, who led the club into the Football League in 1999 and returned with them bottom of League Two, said the Robins ""will always be in my heart"". ""I would know most weeks within an hour of the game ending, wherever I've been, how have Cheltenham got on, who's their team - that hasn't ever left me,"" he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire. ""When I'm not working, I've been down to watch games."" If Cotterill's return after more than two decades away evokes the feeling of a fairytale, then Chris Wilder's third coming at Sheffield United feels more like the correcting of a mistake. Wilder led his hometown club from League One into the Premier League in his first spell between 2016 and 2021 and then guided them to 90 points, and the Championship play-off final, last season in his second stint. He was then surprisingly sacked and replaced by Ruben Selles in June, only for the Spaniard to lose all six of his games in charge and Wilder to be brought back in September. When asked by BBC Radio Sheffield if he would have said 'no' if it had been ""any other football club"", he said: ""Possibly yeah. This is a special and unique club for me.""

Iain Henderson, Nick Timoney, Stuart McCloskey and Jacob Stockdale were included in Andy Farrell's 34-man squad for the autumn internationals that begin with a trip to Chicago to face New Zealand on 1 November. Cormac Izuchukwu missed out due to a foot injury that has seen him stay behind in Belfast to see a specialists as Ulster prepare for a URC game the Sharks in Durban on Saturday (15:00 BST). Ulster will monitor his progress with Sexton saying they will assess whether the 25-year-old forward will join up with the squad for next week's game against the Lions in Johannesburg. However, the inclusion of the Ulster quartet in Farrell's Ireland squad is a positive with Sexton paying tribute to Stockdale whose versatility saw him play at full-back in last week's 28-7 home win against the Lions. ""Jacob is unbelievably talented, you saw the last two nights he's been incredible,"" Sexton said in a media call from Ulster's base in Durban. ""He's size and power, has a good left-footed kicking game, is good in the air and his ability to beat players and offload, I can't speak highly enough about Jacob."" Sexton arrived in Ulster over the summer from Connacht as attack and backs coach. He admits he can be ""demanding"" but in their opening two URC games, Ulster have scored 10 tries as they picked up maximum points. It has been a good start, but Sexton feels there is still room for improvement with the ""ability to finish line breaks"" one area he has identified. ""We just didn't finish the last pass and that needs to get better,"" he said. ""Against the Bulls we were a bit cagey for 30 minutes, so I'd like to throw the shackles off.

2398e9b73172,"BBC must be free of political interference, viewers say",,"BBC must be free of political interference, viewers say Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter BBC Fewer than half of BBC viewers who responded to a major questionnaire sent out by the broadcaster think the corporation is effective at being independent from the government. More than 870,000 members of the public answered questions online about the BBC and its place in society. While 91% of respondents said it was important for the BBC to be independent from the government of the day, only 43% said they thought it was succeeding effectively in practice. A further 38% said they thought it was ineffective. BBC director general Tim Davie said the results showed ""our audience wants an independent BBC, delivering high-quality programmes and content that they can trust"". The BBC invited audience members to have their say in a series of on-air promotions across TV and radio. It also sent emails to 40 million BBC account holders. The results of the Our BBC, Our Future questionnaire come after the relationship between the BBC and the government has been in the spotlight. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy appeared to call for Mr Davie's resignation this summer after a string of scandals, including antisemitic comments by punk duo Bob Vylan at Glastonbury being broadcast on iPlayer, and the revelation that a Gaza documentary was narrated by the son of a Hamas official. In August, former BBC director of news James Harding told the Edinburgh TV Festival that Nandy's involvement in the Bob Vylan scandal was ""chilling"", and criticised ""political interference"", or the perception of it, at the BBC. Last year, BBC chair Samir Shah said there was ""an almost perpetual government review over the BBC"" as a result of the requirement for ministers to renew the broadcaster's royal charter every 10 years. Meanwhile, questions about the BBC's independence were raised when former Tory donor and Rishi Sunak's ex-boss Richard Sharp was named BBC chair in 2021. Mr Sharp resigned two years later over his links to Boris Johnson. Also in 2021, Theresa May's former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb was appointed to the BBC board. One other major gap identified by the questionnaire results was the percentage of respondents who felt the BBC should reflect different parts of the UK and the people who live there (76%), and the percentage who felt it actually did (51%). ""These are gaps that will need to be worked on and addressed as a priority as the BBC's future is debated and we plan how to serve the public better,"" the BBC said. The questionnaire also found: 80% of respondents said it was important for the corporation to offer high-quality digital services, while 78% said the BBC should offer something for everyone 82% said it was important to provide a valuable public service, while 76% said it should be an asset for the UK around the world 83% said it was important that the BBC continued its mission to inform, educate and entertain 78% of respondents said the BBC should offer something for everyone, but only 59% said it was effective at doing so In his statement, Mr Davie described the response to the questionnaire as ""incredible"", which he said ""shows just how much people care about the BBC"". ""I strongly believe the BBC has never been more needed, both in the UK and around the world,"" he said. ""The results of the questionnaire are clear – our audience wants an independent BBC, delivering high-quality programmes and content that they can trust; that tells the stories that matter to them and that reflect their lives."" Mr Davie thanked those who took part, adding: ""We are here to deliver for audiences across the UK and we will be taking everything they have told us with us as we shape the future of the BBC.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9pld9g61o,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0317/live/abdaa160-a9cc-11f0-a5c2-cb318711a6b0.jpg,2025-10-16T07:15:04.015000+00:00,fcf132790f5b182493eff47e7d101807d7a6abb2
058954bf4fc7,Is Microsoft's first ever handheld Xbox console worth the wait?,,"Is Microsoft's first ever handheld Xbox console worth the wait? Tom Gerken Technology reporter Watch: BBC’s Tom Gerken puts the first ever portable Xbox console through its paces For almost two decades, rumours have swirled about a handheld Xbox console to rival Nintendo and PlayStation. Now, it's finally here. The ROG Xbox Ally has been released worldwide, putting an end to the speculation. It works natively with Xbox's Game Pass subscription service out of the box, meaning members will start off with hundreds of games in their library. But its big trick is that it's really a portable computer running Windows, meaning most digital PC games people already own will work too - so long as they don't need a keyboard and mouse to play. It's capable of running most modern games at a decent resolution, although all that tech doesn't come cheap. The handheld costs £499, or £799 for the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X. I've had my hands on the console for the past week and my experience has been positive - though the hardware certainly has its hiccups. So, has it been worth the wait? What's it like? You may not be surprised to hear it feels like a handheld Xbox. The controller that makes up each side of the screen is comfortable to hold. Both thumb sticks have a solid feel to them, and though the face buttons are a bit plastic-y for my taste, the triggers on top of the machine feel great. So far so good - but what about the games? The first thing I did with the device was boot up something known for its vibrant colours - 2019's Persona 5 Royal - to see how good the screen looks. Xbox/Atlus The opening cinematic of Persona 5 Royal showed just how vibrant the colours can be Personally, I thought it looked fantastic. Tech nerds like me may have had concerns that Microsoft went for an LCD display rather than the top-tier OLED displays. In English, that means this portable Xbox doesn't have the best screen available on the market, which may seem like a questionable decision considering the price. But LCD displays have gotten significantly better in recent years, and while it may not have the most vibrant colours possible, I was pretty blown away by how good Persona 5's deep reds looked on the handheld screen. The game played well too, with no visible stutters or freezes - though this is surely to be expected for something that doesn't have the same graphical demands as modern titles. Remember, this isn't like buying a game for the Nintendo Switch 2, where you can expect things will work out of the box. This is much more like buying a game for your home computer. In other words, you don't know for sure whether a game will work or not. It's definitely a mark against the handheld, though it's something PC gamers have been used to for years. As much as this is a handheld Xbox, it could also be described as a portable computer running Windows - all the downsides of PC gaming are present here, but so are the upsides. For example, Baldur's Gate 3, which is known for being particularly demanding at times, proved a challenge for the device on higher graphics settings, but because it's a PC game I could play around with the graphics settings to make it run smoothly. Xbox/Larian Studios In the end, I had to turn many of Baldur's Gate 3's graphics settings down quite a bit before it felt smooth to play The handheld performed admirably with modern games that don't require the best graphics - as you would expect for the price. For example, I had no issues running some of this year's biggest games such as Hades II, Blue Prince and Hollow Knight: Silksong. The device also worked well when playing older games - a similar experience I had to the Steam Deck when that launched in 2022 - but funnily enough, my biggest problems came getting some of them to start. For example, I couldn't get 2001's Sonic Adventure 2 to work properly because of compatibility problems. Thankfully, the handheld runs Windows 11 - so I knew how to fix the bug. What games are available? The ROG Xbox Ally has got a massive library of potential games - many of which you may already own - thanks to being a portable PC. But this thing was really built for Game Pass, Xbox's subscription service for games. Xbox/Concerned Ape Press the Xbox button on the side of the device and it brings up a menu where you can quickly open the subscription service (or other PC gaming platforms) - keen gamers will instantly recognise the game I'm playing Game Pass gives access to a massive history of classic games such as Halo, Gears of War and Fable, as well as modern titles including Call of Duty. With many of these games, you don't need to download to the device - you can stream them over the cloud. Of course, if a game is being streamed from a Microsoft server somewhere, it isn't asking too much of the device to power it - meaning you can get some spectacular graphics from modern games like Modern Warfare 3 on the handheld. Meanwhile, there are subscription services from EA and Ubisoft also bundled into Game Pass Ultimate, giving you access to yet more games from the off. Still, despite Game Pass being front-and-centre on the device, it is not a requirement. Remember, this system is running Windows 11. That means any game made for PC is going to work here - even if it takes a bit of fiddling to make it run properly. Xbox A Game Pass subscription comes in at anywhere between £6.99 and £22.99 a month The harsh reality is that this is not 2001 anymore, when the rumours first started. Handheld PCs are no longer a rarity, and neither are handheld games machines. Nintendo has cornered the market with the Switch - one of the best-selling consoles in history - and its Switch 2 has only improved what made the original great. Sony has its own alternative product in the space, the PlayStation Portal, which can stream games from a connected PlayStation 5, and from the cloud too. And critically, Microsoft's new device comes three and a half years after Valve entered the PC gaming handheld market with the Steam Deck. Xbox, Square Enix, Valve, Sega, Sony, Nintendo Clockwise from the top: a ROG Xbox Ally X playing Dragon Quest XI, a Steam Deck playing Yakuza: Like a Dragon, a PlayStation Portal playing Sonic Frontiers, and a Nintendo Switch 2 playing Donkey Kong: Bananza There's no question the ROG Xbox Ally compares well to many of these rivals in the space - but at the price point, you'd expect it to. Unfortunately, the very thing that makes the Xbox Ally X stand out compared to its rivals - the fact that it natively runs Windows - is at the same time its biggest tension point. On the one hand, it allows for some fun things. It was entertaining to bring up Copilot while playing a game and ask for advice on what to do next - and to be told in a conversational way to talk to a character on-screen in front of me. But you have to deal with Windows, which was hardly developed with a games console in mind. I had to sit and wait for several updates to install before I could even play the thing - hardly every child's dream on Christmas morning. Simply put, it's lacking that bit of extra polish you might expect at a premium price. But I do think the people Microsoft is targeting with this product are hardly going to be turned away by a lack of polish. Especially as it has no real impact on the games. The question is whether the allure of Game Pass on-the-go is going to be enough to justify the price of admission. If the goal was to make something that feels like a handheld Xbox, Microsoft has certainly delivered on its promise - but has it come to market too late?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjwlnvx9jpo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b45d/live/4dfd0520-a9f3-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg,2025-10-15T23:11:22.379000+00:00,c45ed4266475dc861a2c9b0c1e1bb3bcf2621c61
890ffcc2788e,UK economy grew slightly in August ahead of key Budget,,"UK economy grew slightly in August ahead of key Budget Nick Edser business reporter Getty Images The UK economy grew slightly in August helped by an increase in manufacturing output, according to the latest official figures. The economy expanded by 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics said, after contracting by 0.1% in July. The government has made boosting the economy a key priority and pressure is mounting ahead of the Budget next month, but economists expect growth to remain sluggish over the next few months. Many analysts expect that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed to meet the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will ""almost certainly"" have to raise taxes. On Wednesday, Reeves said she was ""looking at further measures on tax and spending, to make sure that the public finances always add up"". The main driver of growth in August was the manufacturing sector, which grew by 0.7%. However, the key services sector - which covers businesses in sectors such as retail, hospitality and finance - saw no growth during August. Monthly growth figures can be volatile, and the ONS has downgraded July's figure from its initial estimate of zero growth to a 0.1% contraction. The ONS is focusing on growth over a rolling three-month period, and in the three months to August the economy expanded by 0.3%, which was a slight improvement on the previous figure. ""Economic growth increased slightly in the latest three months. Services growth held steady, while there was a smaller drag from production than previously,"" said Liz McKeown, ONS director of statistics. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that while the economy had returned to growth in August, the ""outlook remains weak"". She said households were facing higher costs for essentials such as food, while uncertainty about potential tax rises in the Budget was ""expected to weigh on activity for both households and businesses"". ""As a result, we anticipate growth to remain sluggish over the coming months."" Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, called August's growth ""meagre"". She said the increases in taxes for businesses that took effect in April this year - such as the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions - were ""undoubtedly playing a part in restraining growth"". ""There is little reason to think GDP growth will accelerate much from here,"" Ms Gregory said. ""The disruption to the auto sector caused by the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack probably meant the economy went backwards in September."" Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year. However, it also said the UK would face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, as result of rising energy and utility bills. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. ""The chancellor is determined to turn this around by helping businesses in every town and high street grow, investing in infrastructure and cutting red tape to get Britain building."" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest figures ""show that growth continues to be weak and Rachel Reeves is now admitting she is going to hike taxes yet again, despite all her promises"". ""If Labour had a plan - or a backbone - they would get spending under control, cut the deficit and get taxes down."" Daisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the government was ""simply not doing enough to kickstart growth"". ""The chancellor must quit her slowcoach approach to the economy and finally drop her damaging national insurance hike, which has stifled business and hit high streets up and down the country.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq65j9pm508o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f9ad/live/065ddcf0-9d4e-11f0-9e5e-c7b443a2076d.jpg,2025-10-16T07:24:56.422000+00:00,14c005498dfe3f5be6fa561326f4f18cc4ffc9df
6af030d6d98a,'I was in tears after neighbour dug up my land',,"'I was in tears after neighbour dug up my land' BBC Andrea Marland said the illegal river digging had been going on for four years A man has been told to stop illegally digging up part of a river by the Environment Agency after complaints by neighbours who had pleaded with him to stop. Andrea Marland, who lives by the River Tonge in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said neighbouring landowner Sam Bancroft had dug away part of the riverbank belonging to her, destroying trees and wildlife in the process. She was one of a group of people who had raised complaints about the work, which Mr Bancroft said was ""essential"" to protect his land from erosion. Mr Bancroft declined to be interviewed by the BBC, but denied damaging the local wildlife, adding he had only cut down dead or dying trees. The environmental watchdog said it had warned Mr Bancroft in 2021 and 2025 that he did not have the necessary flood risk activity permits to carry out the work. Ms Marland, who has lived alongside the river in Tonge Moor for more than 30 years, said she was ""devastated"" after Mr Bancroft had dug away soil from part of the riverbank she owns. ""He's created a ramp so he can bring his digger down to the river and he's cut a 90m channel through my land,"" she said. Ms Marland, who captured this footage, said she was left ""shaking and angry"" Videos recorded by Ms Marland appear to show Mr Bancroft using a small digger to take soil from her land and move it to the opposite riverbank which he owns.

Ms Marland said the digging had been going on for four years. ""When you can't get anywhere with anybody because nobody does what they're supposed to do, you're in tears, you're shaking and angry,"" Ms Marland said. Andrea Marland Ms Marland said a long channel had been cut through her land by Mr Bancroft Residents claimed the work carried out by Mr Bancroft had destroyed healthy trees and damaged local wildlife habitats. Christopher Banks, a wildlife campaigner in Bolton, claimed the digging had affected areas used by kingfishers. ""The problem is if you start digging out embankments, which kingfishers use as their main habitats, they will completely avoid this area"", he said. ""That's a large amount of habitat that's now been null and void for the kingfisher to use in future."" Mr Banks said the digging was ""unacceptable"" and called on the Environment Agency to ""take strong action"" against Mr Bancroft. Wildlife campaigner Christopher Banks said strong action needed to be taken over the illegal digging Mr Bancroft claimed his work, to reinforce the riverbank he owned, had not affected anyone else's land. He admitted to the BBC that he had been carrying out the digging without the necessary Environment Agency permits and said he could not afford them. Mr Bancroft said he had stopped work in July 2025 when ordered to do so by an Environment Agency enforcement officer. Another local resident, Pauline Riley, said she was ""frustrated and annoyed"" with the response from the Environment Agency. ""After four years of us telling them what he's done, they've done nothing. They've not even been down to the river to look at what he's done. ""They have no idea the damage he has done"", she added. The Environment Agency declined to respond to criticisms from residents, but said: ""We take reports of unauthorised work in rivers seriously and will always investigate. ""Any confirmed unauthorised activity is assessed for potential harm to the watercourse and surrounding environment, and enforcement action will be taken where appropriate.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q79yjy9v0o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8e3d/live/0f7955c0-9def-11f0-84af-5952fa7ec6ed.jpg,2025-10-16T05:06:48.565000+00:00,42511ccd4b7561a4d6c8ed92702f45d40c89da1c

But after selling out her previous two UK and Ireland tours and becoming the first female comedian to sell out Belfast's SSE Arena in 2024, she found herself in the ""depths of depression"". ""A big part of my job is making people laugh, but I couldn't even make myself smile,"" she said. When her tour ended last year, Ms Terry, known on TikTok as Mammy Banter, said it was as if her ""entire body and mind just went 'we can relax now, we can break down now'"". ""It was that debilitating stage where I couldn't function,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster . The only thing she could do was ""hide it from [her] children"", she said, adding that she would take them to school and get back into bed until it was time to pick them up. She got to the stage where she ""didn't want to do anything"". ""I checked out completely of social media, of any career in comedy, I wasn't being social or seeing friends,"" she said. ""I was literally just getting by day by day."" On Tuesday, Ms Terry shared a video on social media explaining what had been happening. She said she had planned to start posting more consistently ahead of her upcoming 2026 tour - but she wanted to be honest first. ""I hope nobody was looking at my social media going 'oh my god I wish I could be where she is' because they had no idea I was at the depths of depression and that's what's so dangerous about social media."" ADHD diagnosis Serena Terry images Ms Terry said she was preparing for her return to the stage For Ms Terry, a turning point came with a diagnosis of combined Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD was first recognised in adults in 2008 , eight years after childhood ADHD was formally recognised through National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in most of the UK NHS (England, Wales, and NI). ""Whereas I thought ADHD was being hyperactive, hyperactive is just one type. There's also inattentive – so I have a combined type where I'm more inattentive,"" Ms Terry said. ""It turns out that during peri-menopause as your oestrogen fluctuates it heightens the symptoms of ADHD, mainly emotional deregulation, and breaks down any coping mechanisms you've had up to that point."" 'Ready to go' Her diagnosis has been ""absolutely life-changing"", Ms Terry said. She had been on anti-depressants but has come off them and is ""correctly medicated"" for her diagnoses. ""It's made so much sense to me in terms of how I personally manage my day to day,"" she added. ""With the medication I have so much cognitive clearance."" Just as she was getting back on her feet, Ms Terry was then hit with a number of challenging life events. Her best friend died of breast cancer, her marriage ended, and her dad was also diagnosed with cancer. She said she had spent the past month ""regrouping"".

It led to high-profile and often ingenious protests by some islanders, with some even spending time in prison for failing to pay the fine for non-payment. Now, more than 20 years after the Scottish government bought the bridge and cancelled the tolls, campaigners are calling for their convictions to be scrapped. Prominent campaigner Robbie the Pict said the convictions should be quashed as a matter of principle. ""I've got 130,"" he told BBC Scotland News. ""On 130 occasions I refused to pay the toll - I've never paid it."" Getty Images Cars were charged £4.70 to cross the bridge during the winter; it rose to £5.70 during tourist season The £20m bridge opened on 16 October 1995, in place of a ferry service which had run between the island village of Kyleakin and the Kyle of Lochalsh. It was hoped that the 500m (546 yard) crossing would make the island more accessible and help boost its economy. The bridge was built under the private finance initiative (PFI) and the tolls were set up so the bridge company could recoup its investment. But the price of a one-way crossing, which soon rose to £5.70 and was said to be the most expensive in Europe, caused anger among the local community and led to almost a decade of protests. By comparison, at that time motorists were charged 80p to cross the Forth Road Bridge which connected Edinburgh and Fife. Protest with a flock of sheep Protests co-ordinated by Skye and Kyle Against Tolls (Skat) drew in islanders from all walks of life and attracted international attention. On its opening day, the first motorists arrived at the tollbooths in their cars and refused to pay. Dozens of cars followed, and driver after driver refused to pay the toll. Several hours later, after refusing to leave, the protesters were charged and reported to the procurator fiscal. Other protests involved driving flocks of sheep across the bridge, while others paid their tolls in pennies. Hundreds of people refused to pay, with some facing 100 or more criminal charges. In total, 130 people ended up with criminal convictions, and some spent time in prison because they refused to pay the fines. PA Media Bagpipers led a midnight motorcade protest across the bridge in 1995 Robbie the Pict, who legally changed his name from Brian Robertson and founded the mini state of ""Pictland"" on an acre of land in Skye in 1977, led the protests. He said the convictions were more of a ""nuisance"" than anything else, and said they should be quashed as a matter of principle. ""There needs to be some form of public inquiry so that these convictions can be quashed and so that people can have their record as a decent citizen properly restored,"" he said. ""The matter must be pursued. It's not over yet."" 'I'm not going to go away' He said the convictions had affected some protesters' ability to travel. ""People would arrive in New York and get asked if they had any criminal convictions. ""They were refused entry to America as a traveller for a fake tolls conviction,"" he said. Despite the passage of time, he said he was as motivated as ever in his campaign. ""We've reached base camp at Everest and we are ready for the push,"" he said. ""I'm rejuvenated every time the problem is re-recognised because the problem is not going to go away, I'm not going to go away. ""We're not the people who should've been criminalised."" The Scottish government finally bought the bridge in 2004 for £27m and cancelled the toll, making the bridge free to use. Local people celebrated with a huge Hogmanay party on both sides of the bridge , with fireworks lighting up the sky. Caroline Clouston said the bridge has brought more positives than negatives Caroline Clouston, who ran the village shop in Kyleakin and now chairs the local historical society, initially opposed plans for the bridge and later the tolls. ""When the bridge arrived, it made the village a much quieter place because previously all the traffic went through the village,"" she said. ""Everything revolved around the ferry. Now everything goes the opposite way. It's nicer without all the traffic but business-wise not so good."" Now she says the toll-free bridge has brought benefits to the island, making it more accessible for locals and tourists. ""It's easier for people to get on and off [Skye]. They don't have to sit in a queue [for a ferry] for an hour or two,"" she added. ""You have to move with the times but it may have made Skye too busy now."" ""We just accept it now, it's all part of the village, part of life.""

The city would be split into three new zones with resident permits in the city centre scrapped and students entitled to fewer permits. Owners of large cars would be charged more to encourage them to switch to smaller vehicles. The 10-year plan affects residents, commuters and visitors but new permits for carers and NHS workers would be created. The plan is aimed at cutting congestion and encouraging people to walk, cycle or use public transport when travelling in and around the city. It is hoped the plan would also reduce air pollution - motorists with diesel cars would have to pay a surcharge to encourage them to switch to less polluting vehicles. Resident permits in the city centre would be scrapped and existing permits would be phased out when the holder moves. Students Beca Hughes, 19, Anna Griffith, 20 and Erin Parry, 19 said cars are essential for some. ""I think a lot of people are reliant on permits,"" Beca said. But she believes fewer students would bring their cars to university if there were fewer permits. ""You notice a lot more people parking on double-yellow lines - you can struggle getting a parking space"", she added. ""We've got a medical student in our house, so she uses her car to go back and forth to the hospital,"" said Erin. Beca said people may feel unsafe in the dark. ""They might not be guaranteed that safety if they can't park right outside their house,"" she said. Joe said he needs his car because he works as a sports coach across South Wales while studying in Cardiff university ""You can't really park outside your house you have to park two streets down,"" said Joe Liston, 19, a sports coach and student. Joe said he is ""not really a fan"" or visitor permit allowances being halved for students. ""I think it's a bit unfair really, I need my car for a job, I work in schools as well as being a student - one day I may be in Caerphilly the next in Newport,"" he said. ""How do you expect me to do that without a car. ""You can't quickly find a train, or I can't really afford to pay for a taxi - there's so many other people who do the same as me."" Cardiff Council Cardiff would be split into three Parking Management Areas, each with its own parking rules Cardiff would be split into three zones - known as Parking Management Areas. The City and Civic Centre The Inner Area The Outer Area Each will have its own rules. The City and Civic Centre would have no residential permits. The Inner Area would be a mix of permits and permitted bays - although not for businesses. The Outer Area would allow all permits, but the times you would need a permit may vary. 'Double-whammy' in car tax and parking charges ""I think they need to have the infrastructure in place,"" said Kathryn Williams, Managing Director of KEW Planning, a town planning consultancy in Cardiff. She said people may not like the ""double-whammy"" of being charged more for their SUV, when they are already charged more in car tax. ""Is it going to be a deterrent - I think people will need to be extremely careful when they're coming into the city,"" she added. ""I think there'll be concern from retailers and people with businesses in the city centre. ""I don't think the communication around the consultation has been that successful, as somebody who works in the industry, we haven't been notified."" Kathryn said there needs to be improvements to public transport. She said: ""I think we really need to look at improving things like our bus services, run a little bit longer, bit more frequent, same with the trains. ""I would use the train far more if they ran a bit later."" She added there were ""safety issues"" with cycling in parts of the city. Kathryn Williams Kathryn Williams, a town planner, said some motorists and businesses may not like the plan, and believes public transport needs to improve ""It's a good idea,"" said Thomas Chu who believes it is right to reduce city centre parking. He used to pay £120 a month for a parking space for his flat. ""It's not suitable for too many cars around here,"" he said, adding it would cut pollution as well. ""If we didn't have a car park at our office it would be a real inconvenience,"" said Georgina Lawrence who works in Cardiff. But she said she does not commute around Cardiff by car ""because it is quite a pain"". ""I had quite a shock the other day coming in from west Wales way - the congestion was atrocious,"" she said. Thomas used to pay £120 a month for a parking space for his flat New carer permits Under the new parking plan new permit types would be created. Essential Service Permits for NHS and council staff. Community Permits for places of worship and schools. Business Permits - but only in the Outer Area. Carer Permits for professional and unpaid carers. A surcharge would be introduced for motorists with ""oversized and highly polluting vehicles"", said the council. Motorists with cars weighing more than 2,400kg, such as large Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) will have to pay more for a permit. Motorists with cars weighing more than 3,500kg will not be eligible for a permit. Cardiff council said the new plan would ""improve the quality of life for residents and visitors"" and would ""prioritises blue badge holders"". Motorcyclists would now require a permit to park in resident bays. A decision on the parking changes will be made by Cardiff council on Thursday but the cost of permits would be decided at a later date.

The book, Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is due to be published next week, almost six months after Ms Giuffre took her own life. Her book, which calls Epstein a ""master manipulator"", describes three occasions where she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her, including at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London. It's further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, and has always denied any wrongdoing. Getty Images Virginia Giuffre holding a picture of herself as a teenager Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, is the testimony of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in Australia in April, in a book co-written with author Amy Wallace. Ms Giuffre, who met Jeffrey Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections. The powerful friends were claimed to include Prince Andrew and the extract published in the Guardian gives her account of when they met in London in March 2001, when she was aged 17. She says the day began by being woken by Ghislaine Maxwell: ""It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince!"" When Andrew arrived later she claims that he was asked to guess her age. ""The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. 'My daughters are just a little younger than you,' he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: 'I guess we will have to trade her in soon.',"" says her memoir. Like Epstein, she said she called him ""Andy"". There is also an account of the notorious photograph from that evening. ""My mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture. ""I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo,"" she writes. They went to dinner and then Tramp nightclub, she recalls, saying Andrew was a ""bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely"". ""On the way back, Maxwell told me, 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey'."" She says of what happened next: ""He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright."" As has been reported before, she claimed he was ""particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches"". And that later Epstein gave her $15,000 for her time with Andrew. Getty Images Prince Andrew has continued to face questions about links to Epstein The book also reports two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. All three of the claimed meetings with Andrew have been reported in detail before, including in her previous witness statements and accounts, but this brings them together and provides her own perspective. ""Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn't hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch,"" she writes. The book also reveals that she was taking tranquilisers to cope with her life working for Epstein. ""Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day,"" she writes. She also explained why she didn't leave ""Epstein's lair even after we knew what he wanted from us."" ""How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable,"" she writes. ""Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care."" After leaving Epstein, Ms Giuffre had settled in Australia where she lived with her husband and three children. She took her own life at the age of 41. Epstein had killed himself in jail in New York in while awaiting trial. Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed on charges related to sex trafficking. Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement, after she had brought a civil case against him, and he denies all the accusations made against him. He refutes Ms Giuffre's claims about having sex with him at the three locations: ""I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened,"" Andrew said in his BBC Newsnight interview. ""I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember a photograph being taken and I've said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever,"" he said. Prince Andrew has faced challenges over aspects of his own account. He said he had cut all links with Epstein after seeing him in New York in December 2010, but an email later emerged from February 2011 which suggested Andrew was still in touch, with the promise to ""play some more soon"".

91bab891a4de,"Australia's rainforests are releasing more carbon than they absorb, warn scientists",,"Australia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found. Rainforests are usually regarded as so-called ""carbon sinks"" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones. But a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths. The lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon. ""Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,"" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University. With fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago. ""Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,"" said Dr Carle. Dr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought. Based on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow. ""We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,"" Dr Carle said. ""And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine."" Senior author Patrick Meir also described the results as ""very concerning"", telling news agency AFP that it was ""likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly"" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment. Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced its new carbon reduction targets , pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade. The country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - to keep operating for another 40 years .

The nine Premier League nominees are Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly and midfielder Ethan Nwaneri, Tottenham Hotspur midfielders Lucas Bergvall and Archie Gray, Chelsea forward Estevao and defender Jorrel Hato, Manchester United defender Leny Yoro, Manchester City full-back Nico O'Reilly and Liverpool centre half Giovanni Leoni. O'Reilly, 20, was named in the senior England squad for the first time for the recent internationals but has yet to make his debut for Thomas Tuchel's team. Defender Dean Huijsen, who joined Real Madrid from Bournemouth in the summer, is also nominated. A leading contender for the Golden Boy award is Paris St-Germain forward Desire Doue, who finished 14th in the Ballon d'Or vote after winning the Champions League with his club side. Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham is also a nominee after helping Sunderland reach the top flight via the play-offs before a move to the Bundesliga. Brother Jude of Real Madrid won the award in 2023. Agyemang was a Euro 2025 hero for England, with the 19-year-old coming off the bench to score vital late equalisers against Sweden and Italy in the knockout stage as the Lionesses went on to successfully defend the trophy. Those notable contributions earned her the Young Player of the Tournament award. She joins Chelsea midfielder Wieke Kaptein and Manchester City midfielder Iman Beney on the 10-player shortlist for the women's award. Award winners are decided by a poll of 50 selected sports journalists from across Europe.

136db809ef92,Former MP suspects he has been spied on by China,,"Former MP suspects he has been spied on by China Getty Images Former MP Tim Loughton had sanctions imposed on him in 2021 by China A former MP and government minister has said he suspects he was the victim of Chinese spying, having been sanctioned by the nation back in 2021. The UK government continues to face questions after charges were dropped against two men accused of spying for China. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham for more than 27 years, expressed concerns that he was ""involved in the files that have been passed over, allegedly, by these two people"". All claims have been denied by China , with foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating: ""We firmly oppose peddling China spy narratives and vilifying China."" Mr Loughton told BBC Radio Sussex : ""I've been involved with China for a long time. ""I've called out China's human rights abuses, I was one of those who put forward amendments to make sure Chinese government companies weren't involved in our infrastructure projects, as a result of which I'm a subject of interest to them."" The former MP, who stood down last year, also highlighted an incident in 2024 when he said he was deported during a trip to Djibouti . He claimed that it was because of the east African country's close ties to China. 'Interpol's red list' Mr Loughton was one of seven parliamentarians sanctioned by China in 2021, with the remainder still in parliament. ""The real fear is that we could be on Interpol's red list, and if we find ourselves in a country which has repatriation agreements with China, we could be arrested and find ourselves on a plane to Beijing,"" Mr Loughton said. He also highlighted that he no longer had the ""certain protections"" afforded to parliamentarians, requiring him to be ""even more wary"". The proceedings against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat , according to the director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson. Mr Loughton said the outcome was ""exceedingly mysterious and concerning"", claiming that he had been given briefings which said that it was ""a very clear-cut case"".

Large crowds of mourners carrying twigs and palm branches breached security at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) immediately after the body of the former leader arrived on Thursday morning. Authorities said mourners gained access to restricted areas, prompting a ""precautionary closure"" to allow security teams to restore order and ensure safety. The airport later said operations had been restored following the shutdown, which lasted about two hours. Because of the unexpectedly huge crowds, the public viewing ceremony for his body has been moved to Nairobi's Moi International Sports Centre, rather than inside the parliament building. Mourners thronged the streets and other locations in the capital as they waited to welcome Odinga's body. Huge crowds gathered on the highway from the airport, at Lee Funeral Home where the body was first expected, and around parliament. ""I came here at  six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odinga's nickname], we have not yet seen him. We are waiting and we hope we'll see him, we'll not leave until we do. We are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father,"" one mourner told the BBC near the airport. The state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria - his political stronghold. Members of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu. According to the family, it was Odinga's wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours. The 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.

The 22-year-old was due to play in Tokyo and Hong Kong but has decided to fly home to recover before starting her preparations for 2026. Those preparations will include coach Francisco Roig, as the pair have agreed to work together again next season. Raducanu had her blood pressure taken during her first-round match with Ann Li in Wuhan last week and retired when trailing 6-1 4-1 on an oppressively humid day. She again required a visit from the doctor at this week's Ningbo Open, where she lost in three sets to Chinese wildcard Zhu Lin in the opening round. Raducanu was also moving far from freely in the deciding set against Zhu because of the lower back problem that has troubled her at times this year.

Traditionally played between August and October, the Rugby Championship is contested by South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina - with the Springboks the current holders.

But it will not go ahead next year, with the southern hemisphere's leading international competition mothballed for a season to create space for New Zealand to tour world champions South Africa in a series billed as ""the Greatest Rivalry"", as well as World Rugby's inaugural Nations Championship.

In 2027, the Rugby Championship will return in an earlier slot in July and August before the Rugby World Cup in Australia.

Sanzaar confirmed that the Rugby Championship will be played 2028 and 2029 before pausing again in 2030 for an international multi-week tour, likely to be another series between the Springboks and All Blacks.

Next year, World Rugby launches the Nations Championship, taking place in the July and November Test windows and featuring the leading teams in the world - the Six Nations sides, their Rugby Championship counterparts and two more invited teams.

83b12c0110a1,Oscar Wilde's library card reissued 130 years after being revoked over gay conviction,,"Oscar Wilde's library card reissued 130 years after being revoked over gay conviction Paul Glynn Culture reporter British Library Board The date of Oscar Wilde's death, 30 November 1900, has been used as the new card's expiry date The British Library has honoured late Irish writer Oscar Wilde by reissuing a reader's card in his name, 130 years after his original was revoked following his conviction for ""gross indecency"". The celebrated novelist, poet and playwright was excluded from the library's reading room in 1895 over his charge for having had homosexual relationships, which was a criminal offence at the time. The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, author Merlin Holland, on Thursday, is intended to ""acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering"" Wilde faced, the library said. Mr Holland said the new card is a ""lovely gesture of forgiveness and I'm sure his spirit will be touched and delighted"". The British Library British Library papers from June 1895 noted: ""Mr O. Wilde excluded from the reading room"" The decision to revoke Wilde's pass for the library - then the British Museum reading room - was recorded without comment in the trustees' minutes for 15 June 1895. He had been in prison for three weeks at the time after being handed a two-year prison sentence with hard labour. The author was convicted after he lost a libel trial against Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being homosexual after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie, was Wilde's lover. The library regulations at the time said anyone convicted of a crime should have their card revoked. 'Letter from prison meant so much' The British Library holds handwritten drafts of some of Wilde's most famous plays including The Importance of Being Ernest, An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance and Lady Windermere's Fan. Its collection also includes De Profundis, the letter he wrote to Bosie from Reading Gaol. Mr Holland, the only living descendant of Wilde, will collect the new card at a ceremony at the venue on what would have been his grandfather's 171st birthday. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Holland said he felt both ""proud"" of his grandfather and slightly burderened by the responsibility of handling his legacy. ""People will so often write in to me and say, 'I cannot tell you how much your grandfather's De Profundis meant to me',"" he explained. ""It has a note of positivity at the end... he's going to come out of prison and do something again. ""And people have written to me saying, 'In a moment of terrible depression about my own life I read De Profundis, and I just wanted you to know that your grandfather's letter from prison meant so much to me'."" British Library Trustees' papers noted Wilde's exclusion from the library at the time Dame Carol Black, chair of the British Library, described Wilde as ""one of the most significant literary figures of the nineteenth century"". She said that by reissuing his library card, ""we hope to not only honour Wilde's memory but also acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering he faced as a result of his conviction"".

The Keaton family said in a statement to People magazine that the Oscar winner's death was caused by pneumonia. Keaton shot to fame in the 1970s for her work in The Godfather films, and also starred in Father of the Bride, Something's Gotta Give, First Wives Club and Annie Hall - for which she won an Academy Award in 1978. The actress's death in California on Saturday led to an outpouring of tributes from Hollywood legends, including co-stars in some of her most popular films. ""The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,"" read the statement to People magazine, which first reported Keaton's death. The BBC has asked for comment from the actress's representatives. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be caused by many different germs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some people are considered to be at higher risk due to their age, or if they have any underlying health conditions. The Keaton family statement also asked that any donations or support be directed to causes that were important to the actress, primarily local food banks or an animal shelter. Among those who have paid tribute to Keaton in recent days are First Wives Club co-star Goldie Hawn, who said Keaton left ""a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination"". Bette Midler, who co-starred alongside the pair in the film, called Keaton ""brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary"". Steve Martin, who starred with Keaton in Father of the Bride alongside Martin Short, reposted an excerpt of a magazine article in which Short is quoted asking: ""Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?"" Keaton replies: ""I mean, you're both idiots."" In his post, Martin wrote: ""Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane."" Throughout her more than five-decade career, Keaton starred in dozens of other films including The Family Stone, Because I Said So, And So It Goes, as well as a number of Woody Allen films, like Play It Again, Sam, Sleeper, Love and Death and Manhattan. For Annie Hall, Keaton won the Academy Award for Best Actress along with a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award. Keaton was nominated for three other Oscars throughout her storied career - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds. As well as her acting achievements, Keaton was known for her trademark style, and favoured wearing turtlenecks, hats and thick-rimmed eyeglasses. That style was even referenced in the film Something's Gotta Give, in which Keaton told Jack Nicholson's character that she's ""just a turtleneck kinda gal"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e38xqx1qwo,Entertainment,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b2cb/live/17936ac0-aa2e-11f0-814b-d74023a6b3c7.jpg,2025-10-16T09:28:29.798000+00:00,307742c7fc34462f6bad292dd02fb816e88be61c

94754d274b81,The Perfect Neighbor: How a 'revolutionary' CCTV film captures a shocking US killing,,"Our mantra as a film team was really 'show and not tell'. You don't have to beat audiences over the head with advocacy – Geeta Gandbhir Director Geeta Gandbhir's reconstruction of events has no narration, and doesn't rely on witness interviews, but instead on a doorbell camera, which captures the sound of a shot being fired, and Owens's son screaming to call 911. Police body cameras track paramedics trying to help Owens after she is shot. Later cameras follow, unrelentingly, as the children's father breaks the news to them that their mother ""isn't coming back"". And cameras inside the police car show Susan Lorincz, not under arrest, sitting in the back, while a neighbour shouts, ""why did you do it?"" Gandbhir tells the BBC that the footage first came to her as she was a family friend of Owens's. Lawyers acting for the Owens family had requested the material from the police, and the family wanted to know if there might be anything to keep the case in the news. ""There was about thirty hours of video about the case, including doorbell camera, bodycam and cell phone footage, detective interviews with people in the community, as well as audio recordings from Susan's conversations with the police, when she had called them many, many, many times,"" Gandbhir says. ""It was a mess, but we managed to get through it, and that's when I realised it might be a film."" The footage shows that the first time police officers were called to Lorincz's address because of a dispute with Ajike Owens was in February 2022, when Lorincz claimed that Owens had thrown a ""No Trespassing"" sign that belonged to Lorincz at her and hit her on the leg (Owens said that she had thrown it on the ground and was not aiming it at her neighbour.) No one was arrested. Police are called out several times through the following year, as Lorincz makes emergency calls complaining that local kids, including Owen's children, are tormenting her. ""I'm a single woman, I work from home, I'm peaceful, I'm the perfect neighbour,"" Lorincz says in another call to the police, when she's complaining about neighbourhood children playing football on the grass near her house.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251015-the-perfect-neighbor-the-cctv-film-that-captures-a-shocking-us-killing,Culture,BBC,,https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0m8rdpc.jpg,2025-10-16T10:23:01.976000+00:00,c0b0db8b6ab445f785284c6a1ab1e1aab2af988a
12f0486f7c82,Man accused of killing Scots gangsters to appear in Spanish court,,"Man accused of killing Scots gangsters to appear in Spanish court David Cowan Scotland home affairs correspondent Spindrift Eddie Lyons Jr (left) and Ross Monaghan were killed in the shooting at Monaghans bar in Fuengirola in May A man accused of murdering two Scottish gang members on the Costa Del Sol will appear in a Spanish court later after he was extradited from the UK. Spanish police have alleged that Michael Riley shot Eddie Lyons Jnr and Ross Monaghan in Fuengirola on 31 May. The 44-year-old was arrested in Liverpool on 14 June and initially fought his extradition, claiming he would be in fear of his life if he was held in a Spanish prison. However last week the Crown Prosecution Service said that Mr Riley, of Huyton, Liverpool, gave his consent to be taken to Spain to face prosecution and he was extradited on Wednesday. He was taken to Spain by specialist officers from the National Crime Agency's national extradition unit. The victims were connected to the Lyons family, a major organised crime group based in the west of Scotland which has been involved in a bloody feud with the rival Daniels crime clan that has raged for 25 years. Ross Monaghan, 43, and Eddie Lyons Jnr, 46, had been watching the Champions League final with friends when they were targeted just before midnight at Monaghans Bar on Fuengirola's beachfront. According to medical reports, Lyons Jnr died after being hit by a single bullet outside the bar. CCTV footage showed the gunman pursuing Monaghan inside the pub and firing more shots, leaving him fatally injured. Spanish police confirmed Lyons and Monaghan were killed within seconds of each other by the lone gunman who fled the scene on foot. Scottish detectives have been helping the Spanish police with their investigation and have provided background information on the pair, who were cremated after a double funeral in July. The men had been watching the Champions League final at Monaghans bar Following the killings, Malaga-based Spanish police chief Pedro Agudo Novo described Mr Riley as being a member of the Daniels crime group. Police Scotland said there was nothing to suggest the shooting in Fuengirola had been planned from within Scotland. They also said there was no intelligence to suggest a link with another gangland feud which has led to a wave of violence across Scotland's central belt this year. The feud has resulted in a series of assaults, shootings and firebombings against individuals linked to the rival gangs in the east and west of the country. Police Scotland has so far made 57 arrests as part of Operation Portaledge.

fb52e1826229,Soldier F trial judge rejects bid to dismiss case,,"Soldier F trial judge rejects bid to dismiss case Julian O'Neill Crime and justice correspondent and David Wilson BBC News NI BBC A judge has rejected a bid to have the case against Soldier F, who is accused of murdering two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972, dismissed. Soldier F, who denies all charges, is on trial at Belfast Crown Court for the murders of James Wray, 22, and William McKinney, 26. They were among 13 people who were shot dead by the Parachute Regiment at a civil rights demonstration in the Bogside area of the city. He is further accused of five counts of attempted murder. The army veteran's lawyers had made an application that Soldier F had no case to answer, arguing key witness evidence was unreliable and could potentially lead to an unsafe conviction. However, Judge Patrick Lynch refused the application. The ruling means Soldier F's trial continues. The ruling follows an application from Soldier F's lawyers to have the case dismissed over statements made at the time by Soldier G and Soldier H. The statements of Soldier G, now deceased, and Soldier H, who has refused to testify, are crucial the prosecution said, but the defence has argued that they are ""fundamentally flawed"". The case is being heard by a judge sitting without a jury. Who is Soldier F? Soldier F is a former British soldier who served with the Army's Parachute Regiment in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He cannot be named due to an interim court order granting his anonymity. The decision to charge Soldier F was taken by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in 2019. He was one of 18 former soldiers reported to the PPS as a result of a police investigation, which followed the public inquiry into Bloody Sunday conducted by Lord Saville. But he was the only one charged. Two years later, the PPS dropped the case after the collapse of the trial of two other veterans who had been accused of a 1972 murder in Belfast. But the prosecution resumed in 2022 after a legal challenge.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmx2xxlj48o,Society,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e9cc/live/d57e7c70-299f-11ef-b3b8-ed2dd2d12607.jpg,2025-10-16T10:10:38.653000+00:00,3d313ce6e3987c1cdcb150603f4d2a1f9d9401aa
9f19ed10dd14,Labuschagne hits another ton to push for Ashes recall,,"A return to form for Labuschagne would not entirely solve the issues Australia have around their batting line-up for the first Test against England at Perth on 21 November. He was pushed up to open in his most recent Test - the World Test Championship final defeat by South Africa in which he returned scores of 17 and 22 - but has been batting at his previous position of number three for Queensland. Were he to return at number three, the position he has scored all of his Test hundreds, Australia would still be looking for at least one opener. Twenty-year-old Sam Konstas played in West Indies but managed only 50 runs across six innings. Though he scored a century for Australia A in India last month he has not passed 50 in four innings in domestic cricket this season and was dismissed by Scott Boland for a four-ball duck on Wednesday. Tasmania's uncapped opener Jake Weatherald, 30, scored a 99-ball 94 on day two of a low-scoring match against Western Australia on Thursday to push his case. If Labuschagne returned as an opener then it would allow Australia to pick Cameron Green at number three and retain fellow all-rounder Beau Webster in the middle order, though Green only has one fifty in eight innings in that position since being pushed up the order for the Test final against South Africa. Webster is currently out with an ankle injury but Green is in Australia's squad for the  three-match one-day international series against India which begins on Sunday.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c0qpddx17qko,Sports,BBC,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/5921/live/11908da0-aa7f-11f0-9334-19f2cf191969.jpg,2025-10-16T10:44:29.262000+00:00,45c60840afbe723a84fe53c836c2263164129f5e
