Prior to last night, the CPS had made clear that witnesses have an expectation that their evidence will not be publicly discussed in those circumstances. The CPS had also advised that to do so, or to do so in some cases, but not in others, would likely affect the confidence of witnesses in coming forward and hamper the interests of justice. However, given the CPS has now greenlit the publication, we will release the three statements from the DNSA (deputy national security adviser Matt Collins) after a short process. We will release the fullest version possible.

The party says it is calling for “the publication of all communications between the government and the CPS, the minutes of all Government meetings discussing the China spy case, and the correspondence and minutes surrounding planning permission for China’s new embassy and Jingye’s financial implications”. Jingye is the Chinese company that still technically owns British Steel . One allegation is that it has offered to drop a claim for £1bn compensation in return for the UK agreeing to allow the proposed Chinese super-embassy in London to go ahead. Campaigns like this rarely achieve their political goals. But they do enable political parties to harvest email addresses for people who might be minded to support them. Cummings right about China, says former Tory security minister Tom Tugendhat Tom Tugendhat , the Tory former security minister, has backed up what Dominic Cummings told the Times (see 4.17pm ) about China compromising the government system used to transmit vast amounts of secret data. In an interview with LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr, asked about the story, Tugendhat replied: I don’t want to go into the details, but the gist of what Dominic Cummings has put on out is correct. Tugendhat said it would be “very, very serious” if Keir Starmer misled MPs at PMQs today when he said that Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser, did not discuss his witness statement to the CPS for the China spy case with Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, or ministers. He was referring to this exchange Badenoch said: On Monday, the security minister repeatedly told the house that ministers did not take decisions and that it was the deputy national security adviser who had full freedom. Are the government seriously saying that only one man—the deputy national security adviser—had anything to do with this failure? Is the prime minister seriously saying that the deputy did not discuss with the national security adviser, the home secretary or anyone in Downing Street? Is the prime minister seriously saying that? And Starmer replied: Yes, and let me explain why. First, the case was charged under the last government, according to the evidence submitted under that government, who set out their policy position. What was on issue in the trial is not the position of the current government, but the position of the last government. They carefully avoided describing China as an enemy because that was their policy at the time. As far as the position under this government is concerned, no minister or special adviser was involved. I will double-check this – this is important. After the charging decision, the prosecution were very careful about who would then see the witness evidence. I will double-check exactly what instruction was taken, but I can be absolutely clear that no minister was involved, no special adviser was involved in this. I am as assured as I can be that the prosecution was saying that it would be the witnesses only who would be involved in short updates to the evidence that was submitted under the previous government.

Share Updated at 13.16 EDT GB News viewers more likely to wrongly believe net migration to UK rising, study finds A larger proportion of people who frequently watch GB News wrongly believe that net migration to the UK is increasing than those of other major channels, according to a study examining public attitudes to broadcasting impartiality. Michael Savage has the story. PPE Medpro, the company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone, has not met the deadline to pay back almost £122m to the government, the health secretary has said. The department for health and social care successfully sued PPE Medpro, a consortium led by Lady Mone’s husband Doug Barrowman, earlier this year over claims it breached a deal for 25 million surgical gowns during the coronavirus pandemic. In a ruling earlier this month, Lady Justice Cockerill found that the company had breached the contract as the gowns were not sterile , and ordered it to pay back £121,999,219.20 by 4pm on Wednesday. After the deadline passed, Wes Streeting said that PPE Medpro “has failed to meet the deadline to pay” and that interest on the sum was “now accruing daily”. At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers’ hard-earned cash. We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong - in our NHS. You can read my colleague David Conn’s analysis on the uphill battle the government faces in recovering the funds here: Share Updated at 12.50 EDT Badenoch says Starmer should have intervened when he learned CPS about to drop China spy prosecution Kemi Badenoch says Keir Starmer should have intervened when he learned the CPS was about to drop the China spy prosecution. Referring to a line that emerged at the post-PMQs lobby briefing (see 2.15pm ), she said: There we have it. The Prime Minister KNEW the China spying case was about to collapse and did NOTHING because he’s got no backbone. He’s too weak to stand up for our national security. A shameful dereliction of duty. Starmer ’s argument is that politicians should not intervene in CPS decisions. (See 12.54pm .) The Spectator has a cover story this week by Tim Shipman , its political editor, about the threat to the UK from Chinese spying. His report backs up what Dominic Cummings told the Times (see 4.17pm ) about the problem being far more serious than the government acknowledges. Shipman says: Four highly credible sources in the upper echelons of the last government, both political figures and officials, have revealed that far worse scandals [than the one involving the two alleged spies passing on information from Westminster] have been hushed up. One said: ‘There were two very serious cases, one involving China and one Russia, which were swept under the carpet. There was a serious loss of technical data.’ The case involving Russia was suppressed, the source claimed, to avoid embarrassing a former prime minister. Shipman also says that Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser who wrote the government witness statements for the China spy prosecution that was dropped, thought he had given the Crown Prosecution Service what they needed. To muddy the waters further, friends of Collins say he did provide evidence which would have been sufficient and he ‘doesn’t understand’ why the case was dropped. ‘He provided all of these evidence statements. He was told by the CPS that this was exactly what they needed, and then at the last minute they said they were not pursuing the prosecution.’ This individual added: ‘The guilty men and women are in fact in the CPS. They’re the ones who’ve dropped the ball.’ But Shipman claims No 10 was at fault too. In truth, both No. 10 and the CPS are at fault. The judgement in the recent Bulgarian spying case showed that there was no need to prove China an enemy, only to convince a jury China was a threat – so the CPS could have pressed on. Sources close to the PM insist Collins couldn’t contradict the Tory policy towards Beijing at the time, which designated it a strategic competitor rather than an enemy. But Labour could equally well have chosen the legion of quotes from the strategic defence and security review, from Tory ministers and intelligence chiefs, that China was a ‘threat’. They chose not to. The full article should be available here shortly. UK sanctions Russia's largest oil firms in latest pro-Ukraine measures The government has sanctioned Russia’s biggest oil producer Rosneft as part of its latest set of measures targeting Russia’s economy amid the war in Ukraine, PA Media reports. PA says: Foreign secretary Yvette Cooper announced Rosneft, along with Lukoil – two of the world’s largest energy companies – would face restrictions from the UK. The Foreign Office said the two firms export 3.1m barrels of oil a day. Rosneft, Russia’s largest firm, is responsible for 6% of global oil production, and makes up nearly half of Russian oil produced. Other action was taken against the so-called “shadow fleet”, which allows Russia to export oil. The sanctions stop UK businesses and individuals from trading with the named Russian entities. On Monday Steve Witkoff paid tribute to the “incredible” role played by Jonathan Powell, the PM’s national security adviser accused by the Tories of sabotaging the China spy prosecution, in getting the Middle East peace process agreed. In the New Statesman cover story this week, looking at the role played by Powell and Tony Blair in that negotiation, Freddie Hayward explains what sets Powell apart. Here’s an extract. As one figure who knows Powell well put it to me, he is an “Elizabethan privateer” by inclination, distrusted by Whitehall for his independence – “the Institute for Government’s worst nightmare” – but also unusually effective and circumspect in his dealings … Britain’s influence – such as it was – came largely through personal relationships: Powell with Witkoff and, before the reshuffle, David Lammy with Gulf foreign ministers. Powell worked closely with Witkoff to clarify the final agreement, bringing the three plans together in what one senior British official described as a “Venn diagram”. It was this work, behind the scenes, that explains Witkoff’s public thanks to Powell on 13 October as Trump landed in Israel. “This is sofa diplomacy,” one trusted British diplomatic adviser put it to me. “Powell can operate in this world. If it wasn’t for him, we’d be irrelevant.” Dominic Cummings claims 'everybody in Whitehall' knows threat from China far worse than government admits publicly Dominic Cummings , Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, has said that the word “threat” does not even begin to describe how much damage China is doing to Britain. In an interview with the Times , he said that China has been accessing UK government state secrets for years and that the situation is far worse than people realise. He also said that, when he was working in Downing Street, he was briefed about “vast amounts of data classified as extremely secret and extremely dangerous for any foreign entity to control was compromised” as a result of Chinese spying. Cummings, who also told the Times that he was warned when he was in No 10 that he would risk prosecution if he revealed secret information, said it was “ludicrous” that the China spy prosecution could not go ahead because the government would not provide evidence saying China was an enemy. He told the Times: Anyone who has been read in at a high level with the intelligence services on China knows that the word threat doesn’t even begin to cover it. The degree of penetration in espionage, in all kinds of operations, penetration of critical national infrastructure, theft of intellectual property, the whole range of things is absolutely extraordinary. A hundred times worse than it is in the public domain. Everybody who has been briefed on the critical analyses of these things from the intelligence services knows this is true. The idea that it is somehow a difficult semantic question of whether to define them as a threat, or how much of a threat, is absolutely puerile nonsense. And everybody in the heart of Whitehall knows this. Cummings also said that for years British governments have played down the security threat posed by China because they have decided to prioritise the economic relationship. Gerry Adams says he is considering legal action to stop UK passing law stopping him getting compensation for internment Yesterday the government published its Northern Ireland Troubles bill , and it confirmed that the legislation will include provisions to block Gerry Adams from receiving compensation over being interned in the 1970s . Today Adams, the former Sinn Féin president who is widely regarded as having been a leading IRA figure during the Troubles (even though he has always denied this), said he is considering court action to stop this. He said: I have instructed my legal team that it is my intention to pursue legal action against Keir Starmer’s decision to retrospectively change a law which a Conservative government broke over 50 years ago … In 2020 the British supreme court determined that I was wrongfully interned for a period in the 1970s. The decision by the Court was explicit. Interim custody orders not authorised and approved by the secretary of state were illegal. It is believed that upwards of 400 other internees are similarly affected. The British government, which knew it was in the wrong at that time, knowingly broke its own law. In January Keir Starmer made it clear that he would look at ‘every conceivable way’ to ensure that I and others impacted by this did not receive compensation. Yesterday the British government produced legislation which upholds the quashing of the convictions but denies compensation. This is clearly discriminatory. Once again the British state changes the rules to protect its security personnel while denying others equality of treatment. That an Irish government would collude in this is disgraceful … The British want to close the door on their past actions. Like many others I will be speaking to my legal team in the next few days to examine what options here and within Europe are open to us.

9b93b2dc9a60,"English councils to remain poorer than in 2010 despite funding rise, says report",,"Councils in England will still be poorer by the end of this parliament than they were in 2010 despite Labour’s funding increases, according to analysis by the Institute for Government (IfG). Funding cuts from 2010 to 2019 were so severe that they left gaps that could not be filled even by five years of above-inflation increases, leaving local authorities increasingly reliant on emergency funding and capable of providing only legally mandated services, the report shows. The government increased local authority funding by more than 4% in real terms this year, and has promised an increase of more than 1% above inflation each year for the next three years. However, the IfG report suggests the damage done by years of cuts is so severe that many people will not notice any difference to their local services. graphic Stuart Hoddinott, the author of the report, said: “Most public services struggled when spending was cut during the early 2010s, but few as much as local government. Cuts were so deep that, even with sustained increases throughout the 2020s, funding is still due to be lower in real terms in 2028-29 than it was almost two decades earlier.” Mark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the report, said: “Over the past 15 years, per person spending on local authority services excluding social care has fallen by a staggering 38%. These cuts have had a direct impact on people’s lives, their wellbeing, and the resilience of their communities.” The report tracked councils’ spending power since 2010, when the coalition government began to slash local authority funding. It found that even with Labour’s spending increases, English councils would have nearly 15% less spending power on average per capita than they did in 2010. Birmingham, the largest local authority, remains under acute pressure as it uses its reserve fund to maintain statutory services. Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty Images From 2009-10 to 2023-24, the researchers found, councils cut spending on youth centres by 60% and on libraries by 50%, and focused almost exclusively on essential services such as statutory social care, which now takes up more than two-thirds of budgets. The rise in social care spending has been caused by an explosion in demand for statutory services for an ageing population, the rise in numbers of children and working-age adults with complex physical and emotional needs, and the ballooning cost of privately provided specialist care services such as children’s residential homes. Graphic One interviewee told the report’s authors that local authorities had become “adult social care factories”. The IfG also found a record number of councils were relying on emergency funding, and that if the government had not delayed a requirement for authorities to account for special educational needs provision, 40% would have been driven to the point of bankruptcy. Hoddinott said that one reason for dissatisfaction with public services was that while money had started coming back into local areas, it was being almost entirely spent on essential services for vulnerable people, rather than amenities used by the general population. Graphic Meanwhile, councils are increasingly using their budgets to pay for costly crisis services such as child protection and children’s homes, rather than preventive services. Spending on looked-after children went up by 71% between 2009-10 and 2023-24; over the same period, investment in early intervention services such as children’s centres fell by 79%. These pressures are being most acutely felt in Birmingham , the country’s largest local authority, which in effect declared itself bankrupt two years ago and is still struggling to balance its budget. The council’s latest figures show it is expected to use £80m of its reserve funds, about 8% of the total, by the end of the financial year, partly owing to a £13.4m overspend and £14m in costs from the city’s continuing bin strike.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/15/english-councils-to-remain-poorer-than-2010-despite-funding-boost-says-report,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43377c3e3630a77bb622c03f9cb81368af080629/676_0_6781_5425/master/6781.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1447164b60785b3335b1b65f95cfb3e1",2025-10-15T17:06:00+00:00,88aaa663d78feaddb1bb77255e9596b2a1aa5207
1923947126b5,Jonathan Powell: the trusted aide Starmer is shielding from China spy row,,"In his book about working as Tony Blair’s chief of staff in No 10, Jonathan Powell warned of the danger in leaders surrounding themselves with flatterers and yes-men. He quoted the Italian philosopher of power, Niccolò Machiavelli, on how it was “one error into which princes … are apt to fall” because “men take such pleasure in their own concerns, and so deceive themselves with regard to them”. Blair was largely unmoved by flattery, according to Powell. But Machiavelli’s lessons are no doubt useful to him in his new reincarnation as Keir Starmer’s national security adviser (NSA), where he regularly rubs shoulders with Donald Trump and leaders in the Gulf and far east. Since his appointment – directly made by Starmer – less than a year ago, Powell has arguably become the most influential foreign policy figure in government. One insider said Powell was the “only person Starmer really trusts on foreign policy and he defers to him”. That goes some way towards explaining why Starmer has moved to protect Powell from the barrage of political criticism he has faced over the collapse of the trial of two British men , including a former parliamentary researcher, accused of spying for Beijing. Powell attended a meeting of senior Whitehall figures in September to discuss the implications of the trial days before it was abandoned. Downing Street has strongly denied claims that Powell had any hand in shaping the government evidence that prosecutors said was the reason the charges had to be pulled. Dan Jarvis, the security minister, was dispatched to the Commons to issue a robust defence of Powell on Monday – which inadvertently landed his deputy Matt Collins in hot water. Insiders say the prime minister is loath to lose his most trusted foreign policy aide. A senior government source said Powell was “by the PM’s side in all pivotal international moments”. Those who have worked with him over the years describe Powell as highly intelligent and considered, with the relaxed manner of a person who has seen and done it all before. A former diplomat who has attended meetings with him described him as “much more weighty than the curly mop hair-do might imply”. Asked about what issues he has most focused on, government advisers cite the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as building relations with the US and talks with China. It is a remarkably broad foreign policy portfolio for someone whose job description is to advise the prime minister on national security matters. In practice he is also Starmer’s main foreign policy adviser, filling a role once held by John Bew, and his chief envoy abroad. Donald Trump and Keir Starmer during a summit on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh. A senior government source said Jonathan Powell was ‘by the PM’s side in all pivotal international moments’. Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, singled out Powell’s “incredible input and tireless efforts” in bringing about the ceasefire in Gaza this week . He and Powell spoke almost daily over the summer in the lead-up to the Gaza peace plan being unveiled. Observers have noted the similarities it bears with the Good Friday agreement, which Powell helped negotiate while he worked for Blair. Over the past year, he has also been credited with helping navigate the response to the extraordinary public fallout between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office last year, and drawing up a Ukraine ceasefire proposal in its wake. During the summer, he travelled to China for high-level meetings including with Wang Yi, China’s foreign affairs minister, who would not routinely meet an official. It is perhaps unsurprising that some fear Powell is overloaded with responsibilities. Downing Street appears to recognise this and has appointed Barbara Woodward, a former UK ambassador to the UN and to China, to deputise for Powell. She will take up the role at permanent secretary level and fulfil some of the functions he is carrying out. “There is so much going on that I think it will be a great help,” a government source said. “He’s always travelling back and forth,” said another. Unusually for an NSA, Powell is a politically appointed special adviser rather than a civil servant. Another government source said because of this, Powell was seen in the US as “the dean of the European NSAs”. Compared with his counterparts, they said, “he has more leeway to federate opinion and bring people together”. They added that where it often feels like Whitehall and the Foreign Office are hermetically sealed, Powell “has an extraordinary network of external experts, young and old, and is constantly taking meetings with them”. Critics, however, argue that his role as a special adviser has been used to avoid parliamentary scrutiny – until recently, ministers have rebuffed repeated requests for Powell to be quizzed by MPs and peers. Notably in his book, Powell wrote that it was “desirable that No 10 staff should not be directly answerable to parliament” on the basis that “public sparring should be left to elected politicians rather than courtiers”. Ministers have arrived at a compromise that will see him appear before a closed-doors select committee hearing next month. He has also come under fire for his perceived doveishness on China and the controversial handover deal he negotiated last year to cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius . There are questions over the extent to which he takes direction from Starmer and Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, or shapes policy himself. Asked how he has handled the criticism, the senior government source described him as “unflappable”. “Some backroom boys aren’t satisfied with remaining in the backroom … and want to go on stage in their own right,” Powell wrote in his memoir, adding: “It is usually a mistake to make the transition.” It will not be the first time Powell has found that where the spotlight falls is not always something he can control.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/15/jonathan-powell-the-adviser-who-has-become-a-powerful-influence-on-uk-foreign-policy,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a523b8b60cc34630daa76fa1d1ee28f0c18bbde8/0_150_1979_1583/master/1979.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=774416424433647d92c4154b04b4a8fc",2025-10-15T16:46:36+00:00,3416fae9bf15081d723bba28ce4a00115ee586a3
c4f896455949,"Key witness statement in China spy row to be published, says Starmer",,"Downing Street will publish a witness statement from the deputy national security adviser that is seen as central to the decision to withdraw spying charges against two British men, Keir Starmer has said. Updating MPs at the start of prime minister’s questions, Starmer said the statement by Matthew Collins would be released after a “short process” to ensure all the information within it could be published. The Crown Prosecution Service cleared the way for the witness statement to be published late on Tuesday when it said it had no objection to its release, given that the case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, was no longer live. The controversy began when prosecutors announced last month that they were abandoning charges of espionage against Cash and Berry on the basis that the evidential threshold required could no longer be met. Cash and Berry have always maintained their innocence. The row has centred on the government’s willingness to submit evidence to the trial saying that China poses a threat to UK national security – considered necessary for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Labour ministers have argued that the evidence they submitted was based on the Conservative government’s position at the time when charges were brought. The Conservatives have accused ministers of political interference in the trial, but Starmer said it was “absolutely not” the case and accused the Kemi Badenoch of a “completely scurrilous allegation”. Downing Street told reporters after prime minister’s questions that Starmer did not see the evidence submitted by the government until Wednesday morning, and only found out about the impending collapse of the trial “a couple of days” in advance. The prime minister’s spokesperson insisted that it was not for Starmer to intervene in this scenario. In a series of robust exchanges in the Commons, Badenoch accused Starmer of not being honest about what had happened. “The charges were brought under us, the case collapsed under them,” she said. “Can the prime minister tell us what changed and what collapsed the case?” Starmer turned his fire on the Tories, saying that “it was their failure and they are just slinging mud”. He argued the only reason the case was withdrawn was because the previous Conservative government did not designate China as a threat to the UK. “To be clear, had the Conservatives been quicker in updating our legislation – a review that started in 2015 – these individuals could have been prosecuted, and we would not be where we are,” he said. Starmer added that Collins was a “civil servant of the utmost integrity” and that his witness statement had been made without political input. “Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence,” he said. “I can’t say what the position was of the previous government in relation to the involvement of ministers or special advisers. If the leader of the opposition knows the answer to that question, and I suspect that she does, I invite her to update the house.” Badenoch demanded to know if there had been any discussions involving Jonathan Powell , the government’s national security adviser, and called for the release of any minutes and correspondence between the government and the CPS over the case. “Exactly as I expected, the prime minister had to be dragged out at the top of PMQs to give a statement that answers no questions,” she said. “He had to be dragged out to repeat only more obfuscation. It is simply unbelievable that he is trying to say the last government did not classify China as a threat.” skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dominic Cummings, who served as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, claimed on Wednesday that China had breached high-level systems to obtain “vast amounts” of classified government information for years. Cummings told the Times that he and Johnson were told about the breach in 2020 and that it involved so-called Strap material, a government classification for highly sensitive intelligence material. “Material from intelligence services. Material from the national security secretariat in the Cabinet Office. Things the government has to keep secret. If they’re not secret, then there are very, very serious implications for it,” he said. Cummings said that fundamental infrastructure for transferring sensitive data around the British state was compromised “for years” but did not give details on how the system had been breached. He said he would be willing to share what he knew with MPs if they were to hold an inquiry. On Thursday, Ken McCallum, the head of the domestic security service MI5, is expected to spell out the threats posed by China in an annual security update. Whitehall insiders are frustrated by the failure to prosecute Cash and Berry and reiterate they stand by previous warnings about Chinese hacking and industrial espionage. At prime minister’s questions, ex-Conservative ministers, including former foreign secretary James Cleverly, accused Starmer of misrepresenting their position on China and of obfuscating the real questions in the debate. Tom Tugendhat, a former security minister, said the government was “trying to set up straw men and knock down things that have not been said”, and asked: “What political direction did this government give to their officials before they went to give evidence?” In reply, Starmer said: “Absolutely none. And I will also tell him this: I was the chief prosecutor for five years, and I can say, in those five years, which included three years under the coalition government, where we were taking difficult decisions on MPs’ expenses, not once was I subjected to political pressure of any sort from anyone.

57b8c9fbb135,Equalities watchdog drops trans advice and urges ministers to act fast on new guidance,,"The equalities watchdog has withdrawn interim advice on how institutions should respond to the supreme court ruling on transgender rights, which some campaign groups said could effectively exclude trans people from many public spaces. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said the advice, published in April, shortly after that month’s supreme court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex only , had been taken down from its website. In its place, the EHRC says organisations seeking to understand how to implement the ruling should “take specialist legal advice” ahead of the approval by parliament of the watchdog’s statutory guidance , submitted to ministers in early September. Some Labour MPs joined transgender groups in expressing alarm at the EHRC’s interim advice, which said the supreme court ruling meant transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets meant for the gender they live as, and that in some cases they could not use toilets consistent with their birth sex. This would, rights groups warned, in effect exclude transgender people from much of the public realm. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights has since written to UK MPs warning against the possible “ widespread exclusion of trans people ”. The Good Law Project campaign, which has been supporting several trans and intersex people in challenging the interim advice in the courts, said one of the cases had been due to be heard next month. The EHRC’s announcement that the advice had been withdrawn came at the end of a wider statement in which the watchdog took the unusual step of publicly urging ministers to “act at speed” in approving the statutory guidance. In the statement, the EHRC said it had written to Bridget Phillipson, the equalities minister, pointing out it had sent the guidance six weeks ago , and warning that as things stood, there was no legally accurate advice available. However, the Guardian understands that the delay is a result of the EHRC not yet having sent the government necessary information, including an equalities impact assessment. Officials say that without this, it is not impossible to properly assess the complex, 300-plus-page guidance, which must be approved by Phillipson and then laid before parliament for 40 days. There is also concern among some officials that the guidance will need especially close scrutiny, in part to avoid the risk of legal challenge. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in a statement, Falkner urged ministers to act swiftly, saying the watchdog had been told that some organisations were continuing to abide by the previous guidance, “therefore allowing practices inconsistent with the law to persist”. She said: “The updated code ought to be brought into force as soon as possible. How quickly this happens is now in the government’s hands. We urge them to act at speed.” A Whitehall source said: “Unfortunately this looks like the EHRC deflecting – they still haven’t sent ministers the information they’ve requested in order to assess the draft code.

In its Fiscal Monitor report, the IMF said aggregate government debt had risen more rapidly than expected before the Covid pandemic, when policymakers stepped into protect citizens and bail out hard-hit businesses. It urged governments to switch spending to growth-friendly areas such as infrastructure and education to help bolster the world economy and make debts more sustainable. A 100% global debt-to-GDP ratio would be the highest since 1948, when the world’s large economies had been devastated by six years of war and the costs of rebuilding their ravaged countries. The report named the UK as among the G20 countries whose ratio would peak above 100% of GDP on the IMF’s definition in the coming years – alongside France, Japan, Canada, China and the US. The IMF said there were still upward pressures on spending in many countries – alongside a reluctance to impose tax rises on sceptical voters. “Looming expenditures on defence, natural disasters, disruptive technologies, demographics, and development add to public spending demands. All these pressures and demands come together with sharp political red lines against tax increases and diminished public awareness of fiscal limits,” it said. The IMF argued that emerging economies in particular could struggle to manage their debt burdens – even with much lower debt-to-GDP ratios than their developing country peers. “Many emerging markets and low-income countries face tougher fiscal challenges, despite their relatively low debt,” it said. The IMF added that as many as 55 countries were experiencing debt distress, or at high risk of distress, despite having debt-to-GDP ratios below 60%. Campaigners have called for the IMF to play a greater role in tackling unsustainable debt, arguing that the current debt restructuring process, known as the Common Framework, is too slow and cumbersome, as well as hard to qualify for. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

751ad428f21a,"GB News viewers more likely to wrongly believe net migration to UK rising, study finds",,"A larger proportion of people who frequently watch GB News wrongly believe that net migration to the UK is increasing than those of other major channels, according to a study examining public attitudes to broadcasting impartiality. Research by Cardiff University , seen by the Guardian, also found public opposition to allowing politicians to front current affairs programmes – contradicting research carried out by regulator, Ofcom. It found 51% of the public oppose politicians being allowed to present current affairs programmes. Only 29% agreed with the current rules. With those undecided excluded, 64% do not agree with them. Net migration in the UK has been in decline since the year-ending June 2023 Responding to the findings, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy , said the public were “right to be concerned about elected politicians playing the role of news presenters”. It comes amid heightened political concern about the number of Reform UK politicians appearing on GB News, including the party’s leader, Nigel Farage. Nandy has recently spoken out about coverage in which “political polemic is now presented as news”. Immigration has been the main political theme in British politics for months, despite net migration to Britain almost halving to 431,000 last year. However, the latest research found 84% of frequent GB News viewers believe new migration has increased. That fell to 71% of ITV frequent viewers, 62% for BBC viewers and 51% of the Channel 4 audience. The level of public support for blocking politicians from fronting current affairs shows appears to contradict Ofcom’s own research. Its own report published last year, based on focus groups rather than polling, concluded “there was no consensus” for preventing politicians hosting TV and radio shows. There now appears to be a conflict between Nandy and Ofcom over the issue. Responding to Cardiff University’s findings, Nandy said it was “troubling that the line between political polemic and objective facts has become blurred in some cases in recent years”. “People rightly expect the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality from their broadcast media and we must ensure they get it,” she said. While Ofcom is currently consulting on minor changes to tighten broadcasting rules after some of its rulings against GB News were overturned in the courts, it has no plans to stop politicians presenting shows overall. “Our consultation was about the issue of politicians presenting news content following the high court judgment earlier this year,” a spokesperson said. “It did not extend to considerations around politicians presenting non-news content, including current affairs programmes. We will be publishing our decision in due course.” Angelos Frangopoulos, GB News’s chief executive, has said the channel “has never and does not use politicians to present news programmes”, stating they only presented shows classed as current affairs programmes. Prof Stephen Cushion of Cardiff University’s school of journalism, media and culture, who led the study, said it should lead Ofcom to re-examine the issue. “We would urge Ofcom to reopen its consultation on this and widen its remit to ask whether the public actually wants politicians presenting non-news programming,” he said. Britain’s broadcasting impartiality rules appear to have driven higher trust in TV and radio as sources of news, with 49% of the public saying they trust them. Both are subject to impartiality rules. Just 7% trust social media, with 28% trusting both online sources and print newspapers. The BBC emerged as the most trusted broadcaster for news. Just 18% trusted GB News. While support for retaining impartiality in British broadcasting remains strong, it is becoming weaker among younger audiences. About three-quarters (76%) of people between the age of 50 and 64 think broadcasters in the UK should be regulated for news and current affairs programming. However, that figure sinks to 57% for those aged between 18 and 24. The polling for the study was carried out by YouGov. It conducted a representative poll of about 2,000 people online between 5 and 6 October.",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/15/gb-news-viewers-more-likely-to-wrongly-believe-net-migration-to-uk-increasing,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8cf25322a37a3b5694f08e072cd0a24b9385551/458_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22277d9e0ce9132e873bfd12c5c7882b",2025-10-15T12:44:54+00:00,40518c5e9ac9afc34fd5845b04b15dbfc1e2c8cc
e3c4c15f6b85,"Kemi brings a shovel to a gunfight, and Starmer lets her dig her own hole",,"Y ou would have thought that one embarrassment would have been enough for Kemi Badenoch this week. That she would have had time to reflect on her performance during Tuesday’s Gaza statement and decided that being the only person in Britain who is actually against a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza was not a great stance. But self-awareness just isn’t Kemi’s strong point. She has never come across a hole she didn’t want to dig deeper. She’s just not that bright. Throughout her life, people have told her she can achieve anything if she tried hard enough and she’s made the fatal mistake of believing them. Of course, Kemi might argue that she has proved the doubters wrong. She has become leader of the Tory party, after all. Though that’s not the job it used to be. A small party becoming ever smaller. Where no sensible person really wants to be leader anyway. But credit where credit’s due – Kemi is the living embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger effect. She had come to Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions pumped up to continue her interrogation over the collapse of the China spying case. Just as everyone had expected. Not least, Keir Starmer , who opened the session with a lengthy statement. The Tory accusations were baseless. It was just a desperate attempt to make trouble. The facts of the case were as described earlier – it had been the Tories’ failure, while in government, to describe the Chinese as a threat that had led to the charges being dropped. But in the interests of transparency, he was going to publish the three witness statements, including the key one from Matt Collins, the deputy national security adviser. All this completely wrongfooted Kemi. She had come to the Commons expecting to put Starmer under the cosh simply by repeating the same allegations she had made during the ministerial statement on Monday. She had made no real headway then, but had come back for another go. She is nothing if not a trier. It had worked at her party conference where standing up for an hour without falling over and announcing a tax cut she was never going to make happen was enough to make everyone think she had been sent down from heaven as leader. The latest in a long line of Tory messiahs. Other Tories sensed the danger that Kemi was in. Neil O’Brien, shadow minister for policy renewal – whatever that means – came rushing to her side, hoping to explain the implications of what Starmer was saying. Only Kemi wasn’t really in the mood for listening. She never is. Instead she just ploughed on with her original questions. “The prime minister has had to be dragged here to make a statement,” she said. “And he refuses to answer questions.” All great, except none of it was true. Starmer had voluntarily chosen to make a statement and had said he would be happy to answer any questions. From there, it was pretty much all downhill for Kemi. She would have been better off saying she would return to the case once she had time to consider the new evidence. Put the prime minister on notice that this was not yet over. Then change tack for the rest of PMQs . Tax rises, for example. But Kemi is Kemi. She can’t change. Can’t think on her feet. Or when sitting down, for that matter. So for the next 10 minutes she just had to suck it up while she had her arse handed to her on a plate by Starmer. While Keir appeared confident that the evidence would back up his assertions that no pressure had been put on the Crown Prosecution Service to drop the case, Kemi was all shouty conspiracy theory allegations. “You’re a lawyer, not a leader,” said Kemi at one point. Failing to appreciate that this was one occasion where it was quite useful to have some legal expertise. Keir merely pointed out that she was neither a lawyer nor a leader. Case proved. None of which is to say that Starmer provided all the answers. The case is incredibly complex and the evidence confusing. Apparently it’s fine for us to spy on the US – it’s a patriotic duty – but not for the Chinese to spy on us. Spying on friends isn’t really spying. Just backup. Helping them out. Nor was it clear why anyone might think that a Tory MP, Alicia Kearns, was worth spying on. She’s never done anything of any interest to a would-be spy. Copying out her diary would hardly be intelligence. Above all, no one has properly explained why the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges. No one – apart from Kemi – is ruling out incompetence. As it was, Kemi was out-thought and outgunned. Starmer was able to point to quotes from both James Cleverly, the then foreign secretary, and Kemi herself in which they had described being careful not to call China a threat. Time and again, he hammered home his central point that it had been the Tories’ failures that had led to the collapse of the trial. He looked and sounded like a man who thought he had nothing to hide. Tory Tom Tugendhat, who probably knows rather more about the legal complexities of the case, asked Starmer outright whether the government had put any pressure on the CPS. “No,” he said. What’s more, when he had been director of public prosecutions, no government had ever leant on him. It was an article of faith. If it turns out Starmer has been economical with the truth after this, then he will be in a lot of bother. But no one is holding their breath. A lively session ended with Cleverly making a point of order. When he had said China was not a threat, what he had really meant was that China was a huge threat. Would that do? It wouldn’t. Poor old Dimly. Sometimes he says it best when he says nothing at all.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/15/kemi-brings-a-shovel-to-a-gunfight-and-starmer-lets-her-dig-her-own-hole,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc0d7e678f3f983a2994633aabfef0e8b2d27135/1527_70_4370_3496/master/4370.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5387ef635fcf03e721e16f5f47f13ba0",2025-10-15T16:45:01+00:00,8892e9ef7c06f68105769f9a93a409146ec97e03
fcf1a9a126a8,The crisis engulfing Emmanuel Macron contains a warning for Keir Starmer,,"B ritain and France do not share a fixed quota of political stability such that reduced volatility on one side of the Channel causes chaos across the water. It was just a coincidence that Keir Starmer won a huge majority at precisely the moment last July when legislative elections made France ungovernable for Emmanuel Macron. It was a misfortune for both men, and for Europe , that their political trajectories were out of sync. Macron had dealt with four Tory prime ministers before finding a potential ally in the ascendant Labour leader. By then his presidency was in spiralling decline. Britain was rousing itself from Brexit delirium just as France was losing the plot. The two conditions are not comparable in scale. France’s parliamentary paralysis is a big mess. Britain leaving the EU was a monumental calamity. But they are alike, as harms that were self-inflicted at the ballot box by arrogant leaders with misplaced confidence in their powers of persuasion. David Cameron held a referendum in 2016 because he was sure he could charm voters into keeping EU membership. Theresa May incinerated the Tories’ parliamentary majority in 2017 because she was convinced the country would recoil from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party and give her a vast personal mandate to enact Brexit. Macron’s folly had elements of both errors. He dissolved the national assembly last summer because he imagined fresh elections would focus moderate French minds on the threat posed by the far-right National Rally (RN), which had recently triumphed in European elections. He was right, up to a point. Millions of voters did mobilise to deny RN a majority, but to the benefit of leftwing parties that despise the president. Macron responded by trying to form governments from a depleted pool of loyal centrists , in denial of parliamentary arithmetic and defiance of the convention that presidents name prime ministers with some deference to the will of the electorate. The result has been months of paralysis, protest, polarisation, collapsing technocratic administrations, recriminations, demands for new parliamentary elections and calls for a presidential resignation. Macron has no intention of standing down before his term expires in 2027 and no obvious avenue to get much done in the meantime. The combination of frenzy and stasis – everything in turmoil, nothing changing – is reminiscent of the rolling Brexit crisis in parliament that ended in December 2019. By then, enough voters were sickened and demoralised by the whole spectacle that they gave Boris Johnson licence to finish the job however he wanted. In a French version of that story the denouement puts Marine Le Pen, the RN’s former leader and veteran presidential candidate, into the Élysée Palace. Or, if a court upholds a ban on her standing for office as the penalty for an embezzlement conviction, it would be Jordan Bardella, the party’s slick, business-friendly millennial leader. France is so unlike Britain in terms of constitution and political culture that analogies hardly stick. For neighbouring nations with intimately interwoven history, similarly sized populations and comparable economies, the lack of affinity between leaders is remarkable. Or maybe not. Proximity breeds rivalry. French presidents and UK prime ministers always find common ground eventually. The global imperative of cooperation trumps local competition, but solutions have to be reached through a cloud of mistrust formed by unsettled particles of centuries-old enmity. The transatlantic relationship has always been a more comfortable fit for UK prime ministers. There has never been a match of personalities and programmes across the Channel akin to the Thatcher-Reagan alliance of the 1980s or the spark that leapt from Bill Clinton’s New Democrats a decade later to jump start Tony Blair’s New Labour. If they hadn’t risen out of phase, Macron and Starmer might plausibly have achieved something close. They both see themselves as champions of pragmatic, liberal democratic centre-ground politics, unburdened by dogmas of left and right, on a mission to push back a rising tide of demagogy and nationalism. They both arrived at the pinnacle of their respective systems with relatively little experience of government or party politics. Macron became president at 39, having skipped the standard French apprenticeship of mayoral offices and senior ministries. Starmer was 61 when he became prime minister, but he had only been an MP for nine years, and never in government. With professional backgrounds in finance and the law, neither man can be called an outsider but nor were they typical political animals, indigenous to the jungles in which they arrived as top cat. They each neglected to learn some of the feral skills and pack behaviours required for survival. The French president’s arrogance is more spectacular than the British prime minister’s understated self-assurance, but both have made needless enemies by failing to cultivate alliances beyond their innermost cliques. Their personal relationship is said to be warm and open, although not exactly fizzing with chemistry. (Only intimate friends and family have access to that level of connection with the Labour leader.) Their styles are vastly different. At the peak of his powers, Macron had a magnetic eloquence that is not in Starmer’s repertoire. No one has ever accused the Labour prime minister of rhetoric that soars too high in lofty abstraction and geopolitical analysis of Europe’s future. That is Macron’s comfort zone. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Critics may quibble about the detail of such agreements, but there is a clear dividend in enhanced trust. It helps that relations are no longer polluted by the hostile tabloid briefings and snarky historical allusion that were de rigueur whenever the Tories felt Paris was being uncooperative. It turns out that 21st-century diplomacy works better without juvenile comments about Agincourt . Dropping pointless Brexit bluster can only move the dial so far. There are structural limits on bilateral cooperation between an EU member and a “third country”. It doesn’t help that Starmer has been unable to articulate a concept of Britain’s future relationship with its neighbours – a sense of destination and strategic purpose to engage Macron’s interest in what Brussels policymakers call the “variable geometry” of the European project. The UK prime minister came to power with timid and hazy pro-European ambitions. And by then the French president, who might have been excited by something bolder, was already haemorrhaging authority from his multiple domestic wounds. The hope of some Franco-British special relationship to bolster Europe belongs in the realm of counterfactual imagination. In the real world, the comparison of Macronism and Starmerism works only as a tragedy of missed opportunity; a tale of two missions that captured the centre ground, then failed to build anything durable there. The French president is besieged by radical forces of left and right, each naming the other as their mortal enemy, while harmonising in scorn for an incumbent who has run out of road. Macron leaves no legacy for an anointed successor to defend. His blessing would probably kill any candidacy. The cry to rally to the aid of a Republic under threat from the far right has been issued and reissued with diminishing returns through successive elections. The wolf entered the mainstream long ago. It prowls freely in parliament, persuading increasing numbers of French voters and business leaders that it has domesticated itself, that it is no longer the predator of cautionary fable. It growls that the real threat to democracy and the economy comes from the left. Nigel Farage and his pack of British wolves are watching and learning. They see how resistance is worn down. They see support for the liberal centre drain away because it only ever finds its voice in a last-minute panic of self-defence. They see how to cast moderate, pragmatic government as feeble, corrupt advocacy for the status quo. That is the trap being set for Starmer.

3803c8caa5af,"The Guardian view on the IMF’s warning: Britain’s economy runs hot for profits, cold for pay",,"B loomberg’s headline said it all: “UK Faces Worst G-7 Inflation and Flat Living Standards, IMF Says”. The International Monetary Fund warns that inflation will be higher in the UK than in any other major advanced economy – including in the US, where Donald Trump’s tariffs are driving up costs for American consumers. This while GDP growth per head crawls at 0.4%, the weakest of any major economy. Real wages have stagnated for 11 months. Meanwhile, official figures show that unemployment has climbed to 4.8%, the highest since spring 2021. Forget talk of Britain’s “upgraded growth”; the economy, under Labour, is running hot only for those collecting profits. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) projects that by 2029 average disposable incomes will be £570 lower than today, a fall of 1.3% – the sharpest drop in living standards since records began in 1961. This isn’t a simple case of prices getting ahead of demand. What Britain faces is profit inflation : prices are rising while wages stand still. As Lord Keynes noted, this is a transfer from labour to capital – an increase in mark-ups, not in productivity. The Treasury takes the opposite view. Despite the evidence, it thinks total spending is about right to buy all the goods and services that the economy could produce at full employment. It sees inflation as evidence of overheating because of “wage stickiness” and rising import costs. This reasoning has become increasingly difficult to sustain. In August the Bank of England broke ranks to say that the lack of jobs was partly down to a “ weakness in underlying demand ”. Britain’s household saving rate – around 11% – is the highest, bar the pandemic, since the early 2010s , signalling not exuberance but caution. Consumer confidence is falling. Britain doesn’t need more belt-tightening. It needs more spending targeted at helping those who are in need. This means a budget deficit big enough to substantially offset our trade gap – otherwise the squeeze just lands on families and firms. There should also be a shift in spending – via higher benefits and better-funded public services – towards households, not asset holders. As Mathew Lawrence of the Common Wealth thinktank argues in the Guardian, the state should intervene to make essentials such as energy, housing and transport affordable. There is a moral argument for redistribution. But it is also an economic necessity. The JRF is right when it says security is productive. Families with a financial buffer can invest in skills and take risks; those living month to month cannot. Yet Labour is fixated with the idea that rising asset values will make Britain properous. In opposition, Rachel Reeves promised to review £174bn of tax reliefs, many of which channel “social spending” into asset prices – such as pension subsidies and capital-gains exemptions. She should keep that promise, and look at wealth taxes. Labour risks ending up in a position where it is defending fiscal rules that undermine voters’ livelihoods. Polls suggest that the public are already unimpressed with the government’s performance on raising living standards. A record of falling real wages and rising prices rarely wins elections. The alternative is simple enough: less help for balance sheets, more help for pay packets. We’ve tried pushing growth through rising asset prices before. It ended badly in 2008, and led to a Labour government losing power. That ought to make ministers think again.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-imfs-warning-britains-economy-runs-hot-for-profits-cold-for-pay,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7985cd640ac863d37e4763ded6181a5800efee10/0_0_6683_5346/master/6683.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f755b2b5e9c734ac1c1ad597cbca2acf",2025-10-14T17:59:16+00:00,39d6a1ac54b8c5a96a401140ab21c78804aca0ab
cce6205b2193,The Guardian view on the rising risk from flooding: uninsurable buildings should focus minds on climate adaptation,,"T he bleak prospect facing the market town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire, due to rising flood risks, is first and foremost a problem for locals. After seven floods in four years , and with plans for new flood defences around the town abandoned after costs rose to £30m, the town council announced this month that three buildings it owns, including a theatre and historic pump rooms, no longer have insurance. Independent retailers are in a similar situation, and some are packing up as a result. The number of empty properties is growing. Tenbury is at higher risk than most places from floods, due to its low-lying position between the River Teme and Kyre Brook. But the threat it faces is not unique, and will become more common in future. Last year UK insurers paid out a record £585m for weather-related damage to homes and possessions, after unusually severe storms led to floods in several counties , with buildings left under water in towns including Henley, Wellingborough and Tewkesbury. Analysis by Aviva, the insurance company, found that the number of properties at risk from flooding in England is likely to rise from 6.3m to 8m by the middle of this century. In some neighbourhoods in south-east London, and the towns of Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, 90% of homes are projected to be at risk. Current spending on flood defences is below the £1.5bn annual total recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission. In last year’s budget, future plans were said to be under review , with the latest announcement focused on making it easier for councils in poorer areas to secure funding. Natural flood management measures such as tree planting and wetlands will also be prioritised from next April. But with spending cuts as well as tax rises expected in November, climate resilience and flooding experts must keep up the pressure on ministers to take the rising threat level seriously. The situation in Tenbury should help to focus minds, not least in the local Conservative party. Dame Harriett Baldwin, the Conservative MP who represents West Worcestershire, has said she is furious that the defences proposed for the town were not approved. But the bigger picture is that flood defences nationally are in an alarming state of disrepair following years of underinvestment. Rather than seeking to remedy this, the Tory party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, now wants to repeal the Climate Change Act and abolish the committee of experts that advises ministers about resilience and adaptation. This is a rightwing import. In the US state of Florida, the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has excised references to climate change from state law, despite growing evidence of the rising threat posed by extreme weather. Home insurance costs in the state rose by 42% in 2023 , and more than a dozen insurers have left following a series of disasters. The insurance industry has long been recognised as a potential ally by those struggling for stronger policies on emissions and other forms of climate risk reduction. Earlier this year, one leading insurer warned that without drastic emissions cuts, the threat of a “climate-induced credit crunch” and market paralysis would keep on rising. The uninsurable listed pump rooms in Tenbury can thus be seen as a canary in a coalmine, as well as a building whose loss – if floods end up destroying it – will by felt by thousands of people.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-rising-risk-from-flooding-uninsurable-buildings-should-focus-minds-on-climate-adaptation,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61e12280babeb5544924b07ca3dac4bc4bf390e4/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fbbe472907b56aead9a32fd057f28b5d",2025-10-14T17:58:52+00:00,0ffa0bb002cf610c2c9b125a19092e1b0cd1d54d
7de0dd3b2d79,Keir Starmer back on familiar ground after walk-on part in the Trump show in Egypt,,"K eir Starmer has always known that Monday’s visit to Egypt was going to be the Donald Trump Show. After all, almost every day is the Donald Trump Show and there was no way the US president was going to share the limelight on this of all days. The day when the living Israeli hostages were freed, 1,900 Palestinian detainees were freed and the first aid trucks entered Gaza. This was The Donald’s peace deal . A narcissist is going to narcissise. Everyone else reduced to supporting actors. At best. Keir was relegated to a non-speaking walk on part as an extra. Pushed away after a couple of seconds. Probably preferable to being arm-wrestled like Emmanuel Macron. Though not much. Come Tuesday, Starmer was back in the UK and ready to make a statement to the Commons on the situation in Gaza . One that was altogether more nuanced than much that had been said the day before. One where the celebrations were tempered with a cautious pragmatism. The ceasefire was only the first tentative, necessary step on the way to a permanent peace. No one could take anything for granted. War had become a way of life in the Middle East. It was still possible for everything to turn to dust in a matter of weeks. First though, a shout out to Donald Trump . Through whom all things are possible. Everyone is obliged to thank The Donald for everything these days. He has spies who are paid to keep tabs on all his mentions. Any mentions that are less than hagiographical are regarded with disapproval. On the president’s hitlist. Here’s the thing. The Donald hasn’t orchestrated a ceasefire because he regards it as a moral duty. Part of his office. But because he is doing the world a favour. Everything is transactional. He needs adoration. And a Nobel peace prize . That done, Starmer could move on. Britain had offered its full support to the peace process. Had worked tirelessly behind the scenes, with no need of recognition. Because it was our job. Recognising a Palestinian state had allowed other Arab nations to condemn Hamas. And we knew a thing or two about decommissioning weapons from the Good Friday agreement. But it was going to be a long haul. The Donald wasn’t the first person to come to the Middle-East promising “Everlasting Peace” and that hadn’t worked out especially well. You can have too many Messiahs. What to say about Kemi Badenoch’s reply? Obviously, Kemi comes with one severe psychological impairment. Everything for her is a fight. Her against the world. Her against the Labour party. She looks on any form of agreement as a sign of profound weakness. She just can’t go there. But there’s also another possible explanation for her behaviour. That she is nowhere near as bright as she imagines herself to be. If she finds a stick, she has the uncanny knack of always picking the wrong end. After a fairly neutral opening couple of sentences in which she welcomed the return of the hostages – she had nothing to say about the return of the Palestinians or the reconstruction of Gaza: she takes her partisanship seriously – Kemi started launching an attack on Starmer and the country’s status in the world. For someone who often likes to say how much she loves the UK, she sure spends a lot of time talking it down. And if she really thinks the country is beyond saving, then maybe she and the Tory party could take some responsibility. The prime minister was just welcoming the terrorists back into Gaza, she said. Except he wasn’t. He had spoken at length about Hamas having no part in a future Palestinian state. Kemi was not to be denied. Starmer had damaged relations with Israel . We had played no part in the ceasefire agreement. Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, had said it was delusional to imagine we had. She didn’t seem to have clocked the Steve Witkoff tweet praising the efforts of the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. It was all properly batshit. Here was parliament discussing the most promising peace initiative in the Middle East for the best part of three decades and Kemi just wanted to try to score points off the Labour party. More worryingly, she appeared to have no idea how peace negotiations actually worked. That you needed a plan to which both sides could agree. There had to be something in it for everyone. And sometimes you need to be able to tell your allies some home truths. That something has got to give. That it might have helped the process for the US and the UK to have disagreed on some matters. Sometimes, you have to wonder if Kemi is a serious politician. That was certainly the conclusion all her backbenchers seemed to have reached. All those who spoke after her ignored what she had said. They weren’t going to stoop to her level. This was a time for them to be better than that. After all, what chance was there for a lasting peace in the Middle East if the Commons couldn’t even reach some kind of consensus? One after the other, the Tory MPs lined up to implicitly condemn their leader. Edward Leigh was first to speak. He was concerned not just that Hamas were openly executing Palestinians, but that nothing had been agreed either on ending the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank or on the formation of a Palestinian state. Kemi would have just been happy for the Palestinians to live among the rubble for eternity. Others soon followed. Andrew Mitchell, Julian Lewis, Kit Malthouse. Even Oliver Dowden couldn’t find a nice word to say in support of Kemi. Their contributions were all measured and constructive. Rising to the occasion. Keir made a point of thanking each and everyone of them. They were from a former Conservative party which he had once known and respected. Another world. Even Richard Tice came across as the voice of reason. A surreal moment for all of us. You get the feeling that deep down, Dicky is an establishment man through and through. Much more of this and he will be out on his ear from Reform. The only MP to channel his inner Kemi was the DUP’s Sammy Wilson. Kemi should think long and hard about this. If your target audience is Sammy, you’ve almost certainly picked the wrong side.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/14/keir-starmer-back-on-familiar-ground-after-walk-on-part-in-the-trump-show-in-egypt,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2195ddf391ddf977ad1db07e912181305c849c44/299_0_2991_2393/master/2991.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3855c3f3cb9e0105b9c203611d28ef82",2025-10-14T17:42:41+00:00,81abc093f56d0047e89dafde6ebc86d59983d6a1
8262db4c87cd,Soaring bills are the gift that keeps on giving for Reform. Shame Labour doesn’t have the guts to do anything about them,,"T he profound squeeze on living standards has become the defining, explosive feature of British politics. Each week seems to bring more pain in the form of higher bills. Water bills are forecast to rise again next year , on top of the energy price cap that recently increased to £1,755 a year. For rightwing populists, the cost of living crisis is the gift that keeps on giving, allowing them to blame the experience of declining living standards on migrants and perceived “outsiders”. Unless Britain’s crisis of livability is addressed, Labour will probably be the handmaiden of a Reform victory. We often hear that the cost of living crisis is caused by rising energy prices linked to Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, or by disruption caused by the climate crisis. These factors, while hugely important, are not the whole story. The structure of Britain’s economy amplifies the effects of inflation and makes life more expensive. When external shocks hit our economy, they translate into people paying even higher prices here than they do elsewhere. This is because essential services, such as energy, housing and transport, have been designed as opportunities for profit extraction. Take the energy sector. Recent analysis from Common Wealth, the thinktank I direct, estimated that a quarter of the typical energy bill in 2024 was profit. That is equivalent to every household paying £416 a year so other people can grow rich. The water industry tells a similar story. Almost a third of the average bill goes towards funding shareholder dividends and interest payments. And the rail sector is much the same: more than 100% of its post-tax profits are distributed to shareholders, but most of the industry’s income comes from government subsidies. The cost of living crisis is often framed as a regrettable but somewhat inevitable outcome of market forces and geopolitics. In truth, it reflects political choices about how we organise the provision of basic necessities. Households across Britain are paying a vast “privatisation premium” to access essential services. According to our estimates, the public have funded almost £200bn in dividends to the shareholders of the privatised water, energy and transport companies since the 1990s. Picture the impact: every time you get paid, a slice of your payslip flows out of your bank account and into that of a utility company, where it joins other streams of income from people across the UK, flowing into a gigantic river that siphons wealth away from working people and towards investors. You could think of this privatisation premium as a poll tax that nobody voted for. Because these services are essential to everyday life, we have no choice but to pay for them, no matter how much they cost, often to monopolies that face no competition. The public pay twice over for essentials: first, through higher bills that pad corporate profits, and second, through higher taxes that help subsidise the private providers of essential services. This hidden tax is inherently regressive, because it hits people on lower incomes the hardest. Labour should take direct aim at this premium, and redistribute income from companies and their shareholders back towards ordinary households, or stop this money from being extracted in the first place. Greater Manchester’s bus network, known as the Bee Network, is a case study of these possibilities. Since returning to public control, a simpler and more effective integrated fare structure has been introduced, and the average ticket price has fallen by 15% . While the network is not yet under full public ownership, it shows the potential for improving services and cutting the cost of essentials. But the government is in a bind. The corporations that profit from the cost crisis are the same ones it is desperately trying to get to invest in its plans for infrastructure, housing and the green transition. These companies have enormous leverage – and they know it. Look at how Thames Water’s creditors have recently behaved. Since the government is unwilling to nationalise the water company, creditors have it over a barrel. They have handed the government an ultimatum: relax environmental standards for 15 years , or we will walk away and the whole company will collapse. Or take Ofgem’s systematic favouring of providers over consumers. The regulator has seemingly been reluctant to correct billions in excess profits because it’s scared that investors might take flight. Squeezing out the privatisation premium while these companies still hold the keys to our infrastructure, and still wield all the power, is a dangerous game for the government to play. It will never amount to a negotiation between equals. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Water, energy and transport should be brought back into public ownership and run for public benefit rather than private extraction. This isn’t just about fairness – it’s sound macroeconomic policy. When essential services move out of the market and become free at the point of use, two things happen at once. Households stop paying prices that include the privatisation premium, leaving them with more disposable income. And these rising private costs vanish from inflation statistics, much as GP visits and hospital stays don’t appear in the consumer price index. That statistical shift is not just an accounting trick. Since inflation has momentum – companies raise prices partly based on what they see happening elsewhere in the economy – structurally lower measured inflation helps keep future price rises in check. The Bank of England might even find it has more room to cut interest rates, since the inflation figures it targets would no longer be driven up by profiteering in essential services. True, taxes may need to rise. But unlike the flat prices that include the privatisation premium and hit everyone equally, and therefore the poorest hardest, taxation can be progressive. Design it right, and most households can keep the savings from eliminating shareholder payouts while still contributing to the cost of essential services according to their ability to pay. What we are really talking about here is recognising that “inflation” and “cost of living” measure different things. Clever policy can improve both – but only if we are willing to challenge the business models that currently extract wealth from basic human needs. Everyone should be able to afford a decent and dignified life. Confronting the cost of living crisis will require addressing the business models that have hollowed out Britain’s foundations and left the public to pick up the tab. The ones that reward asset-sweating over asset-building, that prize financial engineering over productive investment. These are not economic accidents. They are features of the British economy. Unless Labour dismantles them, and builds a new era of public provision, it will have no hope of truly improving people’s living standards, and its political fortunes will continue to decline.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/14/bills-reform-labour-cost-of-living-britain,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/815cbcf5e58bfff222a075a969ea98bfa9865d2a/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5e2a274b7f0845abd28f7c087f4c753b",2025-10-14T09:00:16+00:00,69fd6f26312258933b56ce0f25660b6651f89df5
7204379b5d33,"Rachel Reeves, just tell voters why taxes must go up – and then do it",,"I t’s late already: only six weeks to prepare the way for what’s to come. Everyone knows taxes will rise on 26 November, budget day . Speculation runs wild, often malevolently designed to frighten. Will she, won’t she break her pledge not to raise the three big taxes? Even if the chancellor keeps her promise, people already think she’s broken it. She (unwisely) promised tax rises were one-and-done at the last budget, so best to raise a hefty sum now as she’ll be damned anyway. In the old saw, taxes are certain: what’s uncertain is whether they threaten the death of this government. She is some £40bn short , but she’s not short of super-abundant advice. But though everyone knows tax rises are coming, neither she nor the prime minister are rolling the political pitch to explain why this must happen and expound the choices. Above all, now is the time to illuminate first political principles – the civic and moral virtues of taxation itself, which is not a burden but the price of civilisation. Since there’s no avoiding it, make a political virtue of necessity. Remind people what their taxes buy, retell what cuts and austerity did to the public realm and tell voters truths they don’t know: Britain is a lower-taxed nation than its neighbours, and it shows. Ask not what tax cuts will do for your pocket, but what taxes will do for everything that matters most in life. On what would have been her 100th birthday on Monday, the right memorialised Margaret Thatcher, who ignited the nation’s tax-phobia, setting off explosive wealth inequality. (A suitable memento is up for auction, her mother-of-pearl caviar set in a red leather Asprey box.) She redefined tax from a citizen’s contribution to society to a cash-grab by a greedily wasteful state. You will always spend the pound in your pocket better than the state will, she used to say. That’s for Labour to defy, reminding people of life’s basic values. Ask voters what do you care about most? Security of family, neighbourhood and country. Certainty of good treatment in sickness, everyone’s children well-educated for national thriving and support if stricken by bad luck. Streets, parks, public spaces to be proud of, with stadiums, museums and galleries to enjoy. Your tax pound buys what the pound in your pocket never can. That’s the song about hope for the future. Tax reform is the other tune, ironing out irrationalities of relief-riddled injustice. Broader shoulders can carry more weight, but without pretending everything can be paid for by the rich. The Resolution Foundation exposes that the wealth gap between old (early 60s) and young (early 30s) has more than doubled since 2008 : a shift not gained through enterprise, but mostly through an unearned property boom. Look how wealth has shifted from public to private pockets , causing public squalor amid private wealth. These facts Labour needs to state. The great regret, Labour’s original sin, was that fateful pledge not to raise the three taxes collecting approximately 75% of tax revenue; Labour would have won the election anyway. Most authorities say raising income tax is the least economically disruptive, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the National Institute of Economic and Social Research , Prof Sam Freedman of the London School of Economics, psephologist Peter Kellner and many others. But the answer seems to be no: Reeves lets it be known she requests no costings on raising the three forbidden taxes. Further sins? Why was the chance missed to change course having opened the Treasury books on their first day and having found a genuinely shocking level of cheating ? No funds existed to pay for 40 new hospitals and roads without budgets , and Labour claimed Jeremy Hunt’s national insurance tax cut was not financed, while every public service was burned out, with councils tipping into bankruptcy – not through fecklessness but through sabotage. The chance was missed, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causing Donald Trump’s demand for huge extra defence spending, plus his terrible tariffs. The IFS says all governments colluded in a “ conspiracy of silence ” about the state of UK finances. It and others plead for a tax-reforming budget , no more “directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes” to get by for now: straighten out council and property taxes, wealth-related taxes, fuel and road taxes and pension reliefs generous to the rich. There has been no word from the Treasury on radical reforms. When I reached pension age my payslip jumped up with no national insurance to pay. Why? All income should be subject to the same tax and national insurance, earned and unearned, that of pensioners, landlords, shareholders and the self-employed, while equalising capital gains. The Resolution Foundation proposes an ingenious compromise. Raise income tax by 2p but cut national insurance by the same, yielding £6bn from non-earners, protecting all working employees as promised. It’s no use asking the public: polling commissioned by Tax Associates shows they always choose to tax someone else. Their top four options were gambling, capital gains (only 0.5% pay), banks and VAT on private schools, all good but not nearly enough. That’s why Labour needs to explain the hard tax facts of life. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

f665549a06ad,Digital ID: Danes and Estonians find it ‘pretty uncontroversial’,,"For Danish teenagers, getting enrolled for MitID (my ID) has become somewhat of a rite of passage. From the age of 13, Danes can enrol for the national digital ID system, which can be used for everything from logging into online banking to signing documents electronically and booking a doctor’s appointment. But when they hit 15, all children and their parents receive a letter from the government advising them that from now on, the teenagers will receive their own official communications from authorities which will be sent to them via “digital post”, and they will need digital ID to access it. While there is the option to opt out and instead receive physical mail, few do. Today, 97% of the Danish population aged 15 and over is enrolled in MitID and only 5% of Danes have opted out of digital post. The British government, which recently announced plans to introduce a digital ID scheme in the UK by 2029, said it would “take the best aspects” of such systems around the world , including those in Denmark and Estonia. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, has said the new ID would be an app-based system rather than a physical card and hold information on residency status, name, nationality, date of birth and a photo. It would be compulsory to have one to work in the UK. In Denmark, it has taken time to get people accustomed to using digital ID. Enabling people to use it for key apps such as banking was crucial to making it a success, said Adam Lebech, the deputy director general of Denmark’s agency for digital government , and the introduction of digital post had also helped drive take-up. To try to improve access among older generations, volunteers have been trained to show elderly people how to use it. “Up until about 85 years of age the numbers [of those using digital ID] are very high and then it drops after that,” said Lebech. Numbers of Danish people using digital ID and digital post are said to be ‘very high’ up to the age of 85. Photograph: Aleksandar Nakic/Getty Images Like Britain, Denmark has never had a physical national ID card, but it has been developing its digital ID scheme since 2001. In 2022 it completed the move over to its third iteration, MitID, which Lebech said was more secure than its predecessor. It is usually used as an app on a smartphone or tablet but can also take the form of a code display or audio code reader for those who are not able to use an app. Peter Christian Bech-Nielsen, the tech correspondent at the Danish newspaper Ingeniøren (the Engineer), said the digital ID scheme worked well and, so far at least, had come up against little friction from citizens. “Because we are a country where most people trust politicians and the public sector to a high degree, this has been pretty uncontroversial,” he said. But, he added, attitudes to surveillance were changing – in part because of increased awareness of online tracking and public discussion around the subject. “In Denmark in the last 20 years it has been going in one direction only, which is more surveillance, more control. At some point that’s bound to have some repercussions.” At a time of increased instability and heightened threat of sabotage and hybrid warfare across Europe , digitisation also comes with considerable risk if the system goes down. “In the old days you could pretty much walk into a municipal office. You cannot really do that any more,” said Bech-Nielsen. “You have to book an appointment online. So that would be very hard [in the event of a digital system failure], which definitely makes us a less resilient society in terms of hybrid warfare.” Lebech said the digital security threat level was constantly high, an “enormous challenge.” There were, he added, “constantly threats against it” – mainly from social engineering . “It requires constant development and constant battles against criminals,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea started to gain traction in the 1990s after Estonia redeclared its independence from the Soviet Union and needed to rebuild its institutions. “With limited resources but strong technical talent, the government saw digitalisation as a way to deliver public services efficiently and transparently,” said Kristiina Kriisa, a spokesperson for the e-Estonia Briefing Centre . “The goal was to streamline paperwork, reduce bureaucracy, and enable citizens to interact with the state from anywhere.” When Estonia first introduced its national digital ID card in 2002, it became one of the first countries in the world to connect a physical ID document to secure online authentication and legally binding digital signatures. Now citizens can use it to vote digitally, file their taxes and use online banking; an analogue option is maintained. The country also invested heavily in digital literacy in schools. Kriisa said most Estonians were open to new ideas but there were some fears over privacy and security. “The government addressed this by building a legal and technical framework based on trust: citizens own their own data, can see who has accessed it, and are protected by strong data protection laws,” she said. “Due to this transparency, opposition was limited and never became a significant political obstacle. People could see the system worked and saved them time.” As well as using strong encryption and a public key infrastructure (PKI) – which means every card or mobile ID contains unique cryptographic keys – access to sensitive data is logged. Citizens can view their logs themselves, and a national cybersecurity team is constantly on the lookout for threats. Leif Kalev, a political studies professor at Tallinn University, said on the whole, Estonians had “generally been quite willing to accept some reduction in personal freedoms in exchange for technological innovation and new opportunities”. But, he said, the growing body of digital data about individual citizens had prompted worries among some. “The biggest questions have arisen around the fact that the accumulation of digital data about individuals allows for increasingly extensive analysis and knowledge about a person, raising the issue of what the reasonable limits of this should be – from banks and stores to the police and tax authorities,” he said. There are also concerns about the vote-counting system for e-voting. “Certainly, the growing computing power, such as with quantum computers, also poses challenges –the nature of which will become clear in time,” Kalev said.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/15/digital-id-denmark-estonia-uncontroversial-concerns-security-privacy,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4035e7b7eff3d81c9e1f6c60ed048be1af0ed7c4/74_0_1927_1541/master/1927.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8d39a34de920c1c206a2d981df02e2f",2025-10-15T04:01:12+00:00,ee40cdb2f9693fa557e4a32253e7e3ed9c88b9a5
ab08696a7bd4,Young people are biggest victims of UK’s fragile jobs market,,"So much about the UK jobs market is influenced by Rachel Reeves. Without overdoing the blame, say many experts, the chancellor’s tough budget last year and the likelihood of a repeat next month hangs over employers and how they recruit and pay staff. The latest official figures show a rising number of young people out of work in the three months to August. More broadly, unemployment rose to a four-year high and the number of vacancies fell. And then there was the stubborn increase in the public sector wage bill, which outpaced the much more modest increase in private sector wages. Reeves can be held to account for the increasing cost of employment after the hit to employer national insurance and jump in the national living wage that were signalled at the budget last year and implemented in April. Joe Nellis, an economics professor and adviser to the accountants MHA, said the impact was being felt mainly by young people, both graduates and non-graduates, who were most affected by the lack of vacancies. Some experts have blamed a greater reliance by employers on artificial intelligence to carry out the work usually performed by new recruits. But Nellis said employers were simply too scared to take a chance on younger people when minimum wages and taxes were much higher than last year. Employers have singled out the large cut in the threshold for paying national insurance for their reluctance to hire new staff as much as they blame the almost 2p increase in the rate to 15%. It meant many part-time workers were for the first time caught by national insurance. Part-time work is often the entry point for younger staff, but that avenue is now closed to many. Public sector pay rises remain a disproportionate factor in the pay figures after the bumper rises to health and education workers last year. That was an attempt to clear the decks by Labour and appears to have largely succeeded. After rescuing much of the public sector after years of suppressed wages under the last Conservative government, protests about it not being enough have subsided. It means August’s wage rises are likely to be a blip for both the public and private sector. Sanjay Raja, a UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: “Wage bargaining power has softened. And private sector pay settlements should land comfortably around 3% next year.” The prospect of further pain in next month’s budget also hangs over the labour market. While public sector organisations know what funds they will receive over the next three years after a settlement with the Treasury, private sector employers are waiting to see how their prospects might change should extra taxes apply to them. Reeves has made it clear that the Treasury will need to find extra income and businesses are understandably wary they will be tapped again. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

44ab6b6eec87,Muddle over semantics or pressure from China? Collapsed spying case remains baffling,,"There is a baffling contradiction at the heart of the efforts of Dan Jarvis, the security minister, to explain why the prosecution of two Britons accused of spying for China collapsed last month. The problem, he insisted in front of MPs on Monday, was that “it was not the policy of a Conservative government to classify China as a threat to national security”. Except there is plenty of evidence to suggest that China was recognised as a threat by the previous governments in documents and public statements by ministers and officials. All this makes the failure of the government witness – Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser – to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising. The context here is the ongoing fallout from the collapse of the prosecution of Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, who was working for the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns at the time of his arrest, and his friend Christopher Berry, a researcher based in China. Both were accused of spying for China under the 1911 Official Secrets Act because the alleged offences took place between late 2021 and early 2023, when that law was still in force. The archaic legislation, now replaced by the National Security Act, required Collins – as the government witness – to label China as an enemy, redefined after a court case in July 2024 as a “current threat to national security”. But it seems he did not do so to the satisfaction of the Crown Prosecution Service, not just in his original witness statement of December 2023 but again in February and July 2025. The formal explanation continues to be it was this failure that led to the CPS abandoning its case, a month before a trial was due to start. Jarvis, so keen to distance ministers and the prime minister’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, from the embarrassing episode, insisted that the content of the all important evidence was a “matter for the deputy national security adviser”. Although Britain’s relationship with China will always be complex and cannot be reduced to a single word, as Jarvis tried to argue, the idea that Chinese actors were not threatening the UK between 2021 and 2023 is absurd. Kemi Badenoch, responding for the Conservatives, had plenty to aim at, starting with the same policy documents that the Labour minister had sought to offer in his defence. Jarvis cited Boris Johnson’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy published in March 2021, perhaps the best guide to the prevailing policy at the time of the alleged spying. The policy review described China as a “systemic challenge” but, as the Tory party leader was able to point out, also that it was the “biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security”. During this period, between August 2021 and October 2022, the Electoral Commission was hacked by Chinese actors, allowing the cyberattackers access to the electoral register of 40 million people. When the Conservatives formally attributed the hack to Chinese actors, Rishi Sunak, then the prime minister, said China was “the greatest state-based challenge to our national security”. Against this backdrop it is unclear why Downing Street and Jarvis continue to focus on Conservative policy at the time of the alleged offences, when doing so continues to invite scepticism and further questions about whether pressure was discreetly applied on the civil servant to restrict his witness statements. There is no shortage of evidence that Labour, influenced by Powell, wants a closer relationship with China. An obvious solution would be to provide more information by releasing Collins’s three witness statements, redacting, if necessary, any unproven allegations against Cash and Berry. Jarvis did not rule this out on Monday, but said he could not release anything “which may still be used in any further ongoing legal processes”, with Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, still pressing for a private prosecution. This will need to be resolved. For now Labour has struggled to provide an explanation that will kill off suspicion that the government failed to supply prosecutors the information they needed to improve the climate with Beijing. If the collapse of the case really amounts to a muddle over semantics, seeing Collins’s evidence ought to help.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/muddle-over-semantics-or-pressure-from-china-collapsed-spying-case-remains-baffling,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee066fc4e3dd3dbb4e6362791aaffbf989d4408e/139_0_860_688/master/860.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6761721a7176728e3442eb5f6ff5181e",2025-10-13T18:51:50+00:00,1a99fa6fabf0b742444cc461c3cc6afa579b9d10
050183f6a14e,Trump takes centre stage as questions linger over UK’s role in Gaza ceasefire,,"For British officials who had spent the last 24 hours talking up the UK’s role in negotiating peace in Gaza , Monday’s press conference by Donald Trump in Egypt was a brutal lesson in realpolitik. “Where’s the United Kingdom?” asked the US president before ushering up Keir Starmer, who had been stood behind him. Trump briefly shook the prime minister’s hand and called him “his friend”, before turning his back on him and continuing to explain how he had brought peace to the Middle East without allowing the prime minister to say a word. The images were seized on by critics as evidence that Britain had been little more than a bystander while more powerful players haggled over Gaza’s future. A day earlier, Mike Huckabee , the US ambassador to Israel, had described the British education secretary as “delusional” after she talked about the UK’s “key role” in negotiating the deal. Meanwhile Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, reposted a message by the former British military officer, Richard Kemp, claiming: “The British government played no role in the ceasefire agreement, except a negative one by encouraging Hamas to resist through recognition of a nonexistent ‘Palestinian state’.” Downing Street, however, has pointed to comments by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, who posted praise on X about the role played by Starmer’s national security adviser Jonathan Powell. The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Monday: “We’ve been offering our full support for these efforts, over the last few weeks and months, including working behind the scenes with the US, Arab and European nations to help develop ideas and build consensus on the steps that need to be taken to deliver a plan for Gaza’s future.” Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The UK has made it very clear all along that it cares about this, and that matters. For all that Israel complained about the UK recognising Palestinian statehood, that did play an important role in signalling how engaged the UK and others were in what was happening in the region.” Officials point to the roles played by Powell and Tony Blair, the former prime minister, and insist that their experience in piloting the Northern Ireland peace process proved invaluable in bringing Israel and Hamas to the negotiating table. They claim this influence was in part substantive. Point 13 of the 20-point plan, for example, deals with demilitarisation of Gaza, mirroring how important weapons decommissioning proved in the Good Friday agreement. Point 18 meanwhile calls for an “interfaith dialogue process” aimed at “emphasising the benefits that can be derived from peace” – an echo of the Forum for Reconciliation and Peace, which was set up in Northern Ireland in 1994. Some experts reject the idea that Powell, Blair or anyone in Starmer’s government could have helped shape the substance of the deal, not least because it is based on a similar one promoted by the former US president, Joe Biden, before Labour entered government. “This deal has been on the table since Biden,” said Maddox. “It has very little to do with the Good Friday agreement.” One area where Powell does appear to have had an influence however is persuading all sides to enter the negotiation process without necessarily knowing the outcome. “What Northern Ireland taught us is that taking part in the process builds its own trust and momentum,” said one official. “So even if you don’t believe the other side will stick to their commitments, you embark on phase one anyway as a way to show commitment and generate the trust, which comes later.” Starmer himself spent much of Monday talking to other world leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh, repeatedly emphasising that the UK “stands ready to play a leadership role in the reconstruction of Gaza”, according to statements from Downing Street. The prime minister told leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Jordan’s King Abdullah that Britain could specifically help monitor the process of Hamas decommissioning its weapons. Meanwhile Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, is leading a three-day summit at Wilton Park dedicated to discussing the reconstruction of Gaza – with the UK offering £20m in aid towards the effort. But whether the British government will play a more direct role in any transition authority appears to remain undecided. “The precise membership and shape of that board is all still subject to discussion,” No 10 said on Monday.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/uk-role-in-gaza-peace-settlement-questioned-by-us-figures,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da5b0d3079f45801a7ea82ea124d9a01e89bd29b/261_0_2215_1772/master/2215.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65ea6477f17239b96d578c7f2674440e",2025-10-13T17:54:26+00:00,76d94579835bf3072091f57212eb37800ce1cd0c
97f62191fb67,"Raila Odinga, towering Kenyan opposition figure, dies aged 80",,"The veteran Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who ran five times for the presidency and had a profound influence on the country’s politics, has died aged 80 in India . Odinga was in the southern city of Kochi for treatment. The Press Trust of India news agency reported that he had a cardiac arrest during a morning walk. In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Kenya’s president, William Ruto, described Odinga as “a once-in-a-generation leader”, “a giant of democracy” and “a tireless warrior of good governance”. He said: “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage, a pan-Africanist, a unifier who sought peace and unity above power and self-gain, an unceasing servant of the people who gave his all for the promise of a better Kenya.” Ruto declared seven national days of mourning and said Odinga would be accorded a state funeral. An enduring opposition figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga became an MP in 2002 and his most recent run for the presidency was in 2022. Mourners in Nairobi on Wednesday following news of Odinga’s death. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images His narrow loss to Mwai Kibaki in the disputed 2007 election triggered unrest that killed about 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. He became prime minister in 2008 in a national unity government headed by Kibaki as part of a deal to end the bloodshed. In 1982, Odinga, a son of Kenya’s first vice-president, Oginga Odinga, was charged with treason in connection with a coup against the then president, Daniel arap Moi, and detained without trial for six years. An ardent political activist, he was arrested many times during Moi’s administration for fighting against his one-party rule. His fight for democracy helped the country achieve two milestone political reforms: changing to a multiparty democracy in 1991, and enacting a new constitution in 2010. Ruto said in his address: “For decades, Raila dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, equity, and freedom. He endured detention and persecution so that this nation might know and enjoy democracy.” A hugely popular figure, Odinga was able to mobilise massive crowds to attend his rallies, and supporters called him Baba – “father” in Swahili. As news of his death reached the streets, hundreds of supporters from the Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera, where he was MP, made their way in a procession to his home in the Karen neighbourhood. In reaction to youth-led anti-government protests last year, he entered an agreement with the president, William Ruto, under which his Orange Democratic Movement party became part of a “broad-based government” and gained a role in policymaking. A mourner outside the official residence of Raila Odinga in Nairobi. Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images Tributes have poured in for the former prime minister. The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta said : “We have lost a father to the nation, a steadfast champion for the people, and a true son of Kenya. His legacy is not just in the political battles he fought, but in the peace he helped build. It is etched in the very fabric of our nation.” The former chief justice and current presidential aspirant David Maraga said he was shocked by news of Odinga’s death. He described him as “a patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa”. “Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country. Africa has lost a leading voice in pushing for peace, security and development. The world has lost a great leader,” he said . Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission, said Odinga was “a steadfast champion of democracy, good governance, and people-centred development”. He said : “His decades-long commitment to justice, pluralism, and democratic reform left an indelible mark not only on Kenya but across the African continent.” The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said Odinga was a “towering statesman”. Condolences were also offered by Ethiopia’s prime minister , Abiy Ahmed, and the Tanzanian president , Samia Suluhu Hassan, who described Odinga’s death as a tragedy “not just for Kenya, but for all of us”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/raila-odinga-former-kenya-pm-dies,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f33f721974b469db5bb5d78fe0aa85acb1307ef4/453_0_4527_3621/master/4527.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e519dd9c52acaf2c07b0fc92800526f2",2025-10-15T13:28:49+00:00,0942818573438387b82fc5be7be7052d9efa85fe
621414036a69,"Thousands trapped in El Fasher siege on ‘edge of survival’, says report",,"The besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher has been declared “uninhabitable” with new data indicating most homes are destroyed and critical levels of malnourishment among people trapped there. The stark assessment comes as the city endures constant artillery and drone attacks, shoehorning its 250,000 starving people into a shrinking urban enclave. For 549 days El Fasher has been surrounded by fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who have prevented all humanitarian access entering the city as it attempts to seize the army’s last stronghold in west Sudan. Testimonies from households encompassing almost 900 people who recently fled the city – countless others have been abducted and killed by the RSF for trying to escape – confirm a population “pushed to the edge of survival”. The interviews, coordinated last month by US-based medical humanitarian group MedGlobal , offer a first detailed assessment of life inside the siege. A makeshift bunker dug in El Fasher as a hideout from clashes between the paramilitary RSF and the Sudanese army and allied militias. Photograph: Muammar Ibrahim/AFP/Getty Images More than 90% reported their homes had been destroyed, damaged or looted before they fled. A quarter of households had experienced a death within the previous three months. Health screenings on those who reached the town of Al Dabbah, Northern State, after walking for days from El Fasher, found acute and widespread levels of malnutrition. Three-quarters of escapers said they “never or rarely” had food because of the siege. Half revealed that they “never or rarely” had access to water. MedGlobal’s executive director, Joseph Belliveau, said: “The 500-day siege of El Fasher has pushed its inhabitants to the edge of survival. “Some of those who recently arrived to Northern State shared what life was like in El Fasher: ubiquitous violence, destroyed homes, severe shortages of food and water, and almost no access to healthcare. “As one woman put it: ‘In El Fasher I smell death rather than life and hope.’” El Fasher is facing intensifying RSF artillery and drone attacks with one salvo last weekend striking a displacement shelter, killing at least 57 people, including 22 women and 17 children. Three-quarters of residents told MedGlobal they had been forced to move home at least three times while 81% said they “never felt safe” moving around the city. “The destruction of homes and health infrastructure has made El Fasher uninhabitable,” said MedGlobal.

Satellite image © 2022 Maxar Technologies/DigitalGlobe/Getty Images Hope that the siege might end grew last month when US president Donald Trump’s senior adviser for African affairs, Massad Boulos , claimed he and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – which has been repeatedly accused of supporting the RSF – had secured an agreement to allow aid into the city. Those efforts appear to have collapsed, with the RSF instead tightening its siege. El Fasher is now fully encircled by huge earthen berms (raised embankments), making it even harder for civilians to escape. However, in a recent unexpected twist – and with the city believed to be on the brink of collapse – airdrops by the Sudanese military have temporarily resupplied those defending the city. Yet food remains scarce, with MedGlobal’s screenings finding one in five children under five was acutely malnourished. Children under 18 months old were most affected, with 27.5% acutely malnourished. In addition, 38% of pregnant and lactating women were malnourished, undermining maternal health and increasing the risk of infants being born prematurely or underweight. The highest rates were recorded among adolescent girls with 60% of those aged 15 to 19 experiencing what MedGlobal described as “wasting”. Although El Fasher is cut off from the outside world by communications blackouts – 86% reported “no or rare access” to phones or internet – the Guardian has maintained contact with a number of people in the city. Abdessalam Kitir, 50, described using milk from his surviving goat – the other was killed in a drone attack last month – to keep alive a newborn whose entire family died after an RSF shell flattened their home. “The baby lost his mother and father and three brothers and sisters. He was evacuated to the hospital,” said Kitir. But even El Fasher’s last remaining hospital – al Saudi – is being routinely targeted with 13 people killed last week when the RSF shelled it. Indiscriminate shelling means many families spend days in trenches or underground bunkers. Half said they had been victims of violence while 71% had witnessed violence against neighbours and others in the city.

The Sudanese military is also accused of myriad war crimes, most recently when at least 16 people died in one of its drone attacks on a town to the east of El Fasher several days ago. On Tuesday, the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights described Sudan’s conflict as a “war on children”. Lawyers at the centre said children were subject to mass starvation, forced displacement and deliberate attacks. They added that states such as the UAE – which denies supporting the RSF – are in violation of their obligations under the genocide convention for their role in the war.

ddfd37c7e426,Elite military unit says it has seized power in Madagascar,,"An elite military unit said it had taken power in Madagascar on Tuesday, after the country’s parliament impeached president Andry Rajoelina after weeks of anti-government protests. Rajoelina, who said on Monday in a Facebook Live video that he had gone into hiding after attempts to kill him, had refused demands to step down, but the demonstrators won the backing of the influential Capsat unit at the weekend. On Tuesday, the presidency posted a statement saying there had been an “attempted coup d’état”. It continued: “The president of the republic remains fully in office and is ensuring the maintenance of constitutional order and national stability.” Rajoelina has not been seen in public in Madagascar for several days. He reportedly fled the Indian Ocean island on a French military aircraft on Sunday night, after the Capsat military unit said on Saturday that it would not shoot at protesters. While no order for the military to shoot civilians had been made public, the gendarmerie, a police force controlled by the Ministry of Defence, killed demonstrators during the early days of youth-led protests that began on 25 September. The marches started in protest against water and electricity outages and quickly grew to calling for radical political reform and the president’s resignation.

Photograph: Luis Tato/AFP/Getty Images Col Michael Randrianirina, the leader of Capsat, which is short for Corps d’administration des personnels et des services administratifs et techniques , told reporters at a government building in the capital Antananarivo on Tuesday that the military would form a council of officers from the army, gendarmerie military police and police, while a prime minister would be appointed to “quickly” form a civilian government. Randrianirina said in the statement: “Perhaps in time [the council] will include senior civilian advisers. It is this committee that will carry out the work of the presidency … At the same time, after a few days, we will set up a civilian government.” “We have taken power,” Randrianirina told Agence-France Presse, after reading out the statement. Minutes earlier, the lower house of parliament had voted to impeach Rajoelina for desertion of duty. The official presidency Facebook account posted a statement saying that the parliamentary session was “devoid of any legal basis”. The president had dissolved parliament just hours before in a bid to rescue his position. Capsat’s coup marked a dramatic fall from grace for Rajoelina, a 51-year-old former DJ who was himself brought to power by the military regiment, a unit that controls military logistics, in 2009, after street protests against the high cost of living and Rajoelina’s dismissal as mayor of Antananarivo by his predecessor as president, Marc Ravalomanana. Rajoelina was initially president until 2014. He returned to power in 2019 and was re-elected in 2023, in a vote marred by allegations of rigging. Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with a GDP per capita of just $545 last year , according to World Bank data. The island is rich in natural resources, including vanilla and precious gems, which campaigners say have been exploited by officials and corrupt businesspeople. The country ranked 140 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index. The United Nations said 22 people were killed in the first few days of the protest by security forces and during violence and looting by “individuals and gangs not associated with the protesters”. Rajoelina initially denied anyone had been killed, then said that 12 “looters and vandals” had died. The protests were coordinated at first by Gen Z Madagascar , a leaderless group of young people. They use Discord and Signal privately, while posting publicly on Instagram and Facebook. On Saturday, Capsat said it would not fire at protesters and called on other parts of the military to join forces with it. That afternoon, Capsat soldiers drove out of their barracks in southern Antananarivo, accompanied by thousands of cheering protesters, to the symbolic 13 May Square outside city hall. Protesters in Madagascar gather in the capital to celebrate – video On Sunday, Capsat said it was taking control of the military and appointed a new leader of the armed forces. The gendarmerie also fell in line, saying there had been “faults and excesses” in its response to the protests. Also on Sunday, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, the head of Capsat, was installed as chief of the army staff during a ceremony at the army headquarters attended by armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo. “I give him my blessing,” the minister said of Pikulas. Pikulas said to journalists after the ceremony that events in Madagascar had been “unpredictable”, adding: “The army has a responsibility to restore calm and peace throughout Madagascar.” The Gen Z Madagascar movement celebrated the coup on Tuesday. “It’s a great day to be alive!!” it posted on its Instagram stories, followed by videos of people celebrating. “I’m happy personally, because for now the army has been with us, the people, and it knows what we want and that’s what they’re doing right now,” said an 18-year-old activist who helps to run the Gen Z Madagascar social media accounts. He continued: “So the president is calling it a coup, but he’s the one that left the country. He’s the one that came to power with a coup as well, so it’s very hypocritical.” However, a fellow activist said he was “50:50” about the military’s intervention. “It was a must, because as you know, Madagascar was a very corrupt system and I’m happy that this is finally the end of this corrupt system,” he said. “But … I don’t really know what intentions the military group have, so I prefer to stay on my guard and see what they want to do and what they are going to do.” Jean-Luc Raharimanana, 58, a Malagasy novelist and playwright, also celebrated Rajoelina’s overthrow: “It’s a utopia in progress. I truly hope the result lives up to this magnificent struggle.” Agence-France Presse contributed to this report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/elite-military-unit-says-it-has-seized-power-in-madagascar,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e69e83e17a8a91745f73709b9c63e5afecb498/813_0_6074_4860/master/6074.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a5990a4ce0cb63de6261120cb36e343b",2025-10-14T17:41:41+00:00,48ee1caa718752fa74246c723b24472aed0ce349
f82f585a9292,Cameroon opposition leader declares victory in presidential election,,"The Cameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary has declared himself the winner of the 12 October presidential election and called on the incumbent, Paul Biya, to accept the end of his 43-year rule. “Our victory is clear, it must be respected,” Tchiroma said in a video statement on Facebook with the national flag in the background, before directly addressing 92-year-old Biya: “We call on the regime in power to show greatness and to honour the truth of the ballot box with a long-awaited gesture: that phone call of congratulations, which will demonstrate the political maturity of our nation and the future strength of our democracy.” Elecam, the Cameroonian electoral commission, has yet to release the results, which are expected at the latest by 26 October, after validation by the constitutional council. Supporters on both sides are claiming victory based on images circulating on social media of blackboards and papers tallying the results. While it is permitted to publish tally sheets from individual polling stations, it is illegal to announce the overall result of the vote before the constitutional council. “This is the red line that must not be crossed,” the territorial administration minister, Paul Atanga Nji, told a press conference on Sunday. The election, contested by nine opposition candidates, was conducted in a single-round format where the candidate with the most votes wins. More than 8 million citizens were eligible to vote but the turnout remains unknown. Some of the other candidates have already congratulated Tchiroma. A longtime Biya ally and former government spokesperson, Tchiroma, 76, broke ranks by resigning in June, and emerged as the leading opposition candidate. He heads the Front for the National Salvation of Cameroon (FSNC) and is backed by the Union for Change, a coalition of opposition parties. “A country cannot exist in the service of one man,” Tchiroma wrote in an open letter announcing his candidacy. “It must live in the service of its people.” In the 2018 presidential election, opposition challenger Maurice Kamto declared himself the winner the day after the vote. He was subsequently arrested. His supporters’ rallies were dispersed with teargas and water cannon and dozens were detained. Some are still in jail. Biya is only the second head of state to lead Cameroon since independence from France in 1960. He has ruled with an iron fist, repressing all political and armed opposition, and holding on to power despite social upheaval, economic disparity and separatist violence. Tchiroma’s election manifesto promised a transition period of three to five years to rebuild the country, which he said Biya had destroyed. skip past newsletter promotion Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

9989499545e4,Madagascar president says he fled country in fear for his life,,"Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, said he had fled the country in fear for his life after a military rebellion but did not announce his resignation in a speech broadcast on social media late on Monday from an undisclosed location. The 51-year-old has faced weeks of gen Z-led anti-government protests, which reached a pivotal point on Saturday when an elite military unit joined the protests and called for the president and other ministers to step down. That prompted Rajoelina to say that an illegal attempt to seize power was under way in the Indian Ocean island and to leave the country. “I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life,” Rajoelina said in his late-night speech, which was also meant to be shown on Madagascar television but was delayed for hours after soldiers attempted to take control of the state broadcaster buildings, according to the president’s office. The speech was ultimately broadcast on the presidency’s official Facebook page but not on national TV. They were Rajoelina’s first public comments since the Capsat military unit turned against his government in an apparent coup and joined thousands of protesters rallying in a main square in the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend. Protesters march alongside a Madagascar military vehicle in Antananarivo on Monday. Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters Rajoelina called for dialogue “to find a way out of this situation” and said the constitution should be respected. He did not say how he had left Madagascar or where he was, but a report claimed he had been flown out of the country on a French military plane. A French foreign ministry spokesperson declined to comment on that report. Rajoelina was first president from 2009 to 2014 before returning to power in 2019. He was increasingly isolated after losing the support of a key army unit that joined thousands of youths activists known as “Gen Z Madagascar” to protest against corruption and poverty. The movement had earlier turned down an invitation to meet him for dialogue and demanded his resignation. People flooded a square in front of the Antananarivo city hall on Monday, waving flags and chanting slogans, some hanging off military vehicles as they arrived, according to Agence France-Presse reporters. Protesters hang a banner, featuring a symbol adopted by gen Z protest movements worldwide, in front of the city hall in Antananarivo. Photograph: Zo Andrianjafy/Reuters Among the demonstrators were soldiers from the elite Capsat unit, which played a major role in the 2009 coup during Rajoelina’s rise to the presidency after mass protests forced his predecessor Marc Ravalomanana out of power. Also present were gendarmerie officers, accused of using heavy-handed tactics during the near-daily protests over more than two weeks. They admitted in a video statement to “faults and excesses” in their response. At least 22 people were killed in the first days by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, according to the UN. But Rajoelina had disputed the toll, saying last week there were “12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals”. On Saturday, some Capsat soldiers posted a video to social media saying: “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters.” “Close the gates, and await our instructions,” they added. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades in arms because they will not take care of our families if we die.” The showdown began after the arrest of two politicians on 19 September accused of planning a protest against the country’s chronic power and water outages.

102e359f6b2d,Canadian man fined for submitting AI hallucinations as part of legal defense,,"A Quebec man has been ordered to pay C$5,000 (US$3,562) for submitting artificial intelligence hallucinations as part of his legal defense, a move the judge warned was “highly reprehensible” and threatened to undermine integrity in the legal system. Justice Luc Morin of Quebec superior court levied the fine on Jean Laprade in a decision released on 1 October , capping a legal saga the judge said “contains several elements worthy of a successful movie script”, including a “hijacked plane passing through several complacent airports”, Interpol red alerts and the “inappropriate use of artificial intelligence” by Laprade. At issue was a deal for three helicopters and an airplane that Laprade had brokered while in the west African country of Guinea . An error in the contract mistakenly awarded the businessperson an aircraft that was far more valuable than the one agreed upon. Laprade was accused of “diverting” it to Quebec and fended off efforts to recover the plane by two aviation companies. A 2021 decision by the Paris international arbitration chamber ordered him to pay C$2.7m for the aircraft, which has been sitting at the Sherbrooke airport under a seizure order since 2019. In his defense, Laprade submitted several pieces of information to the court that had been fabricated by artificial intelligence, including “eight instances of non-existent citations, decisions not rendered, references without purpose and inconsistent conclusions”. Morin noted in his decision that the courts had previously warned the legal community in 2023 about the use of artificial intelligence, issuing a notice that information generated by AI must be subject to “rigorous human control”. Laprade’s attempt to “mislead the opposing party and the Tribunal by producing fictitious extracts” of case law represented a “serious breach”, Morin wrote. “It should be remembered that the filing of a procedure remains a solemn act that can never be taken lightly.” Laprade apologized and admitted his submissions were “probably not perfect” but said the use of artificial intelligence was key in his defense. Morin noted that Laprade, who is 74 and “who has clearly lived a very interesting life”, faced a challenge in defending himself without legal counsel. “While the court is sensitive to the fact that Mr Laprade’s intention was to defend himself to the best of his abilities using artificial intelligence, his conduct remains highly reprehensible,” wrote the judge. “He must bear alone all the opprobrium resulting from quotations ‘hallucinated’ by artificial intelligence on which he relied to generate his contestation.” Morin also acknowledged both the power and lure of artificial intelligence, which he said could soon transform the courts. “Although its intoxicating promises are matched only by the fears associated with its inappropriate use, artificial intelligence will seriously test the vigilance of the courts for years to come.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/canada-ai-hallucinations-legal-defense,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625c3c33c05e80afecae58aa2af38e7ecddfe73b/362_0_3352_2683/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a57ef0cf593b5b368b1e59ebb843cabc",2025-10-15T16:31:31+00:00,fe320cd4cd9aefef232d70623a016730b8310df9
c130ddb26452,Canadian jobs ‘sacrificed on Trump’s altar’ as Stellantis announces US investment,,"Canadian jobs are being “sacrificed on the Trump altar”, union leaders have warned, after the automaker Stellantis announced plans to transfer production of one Jeep model to the United States. Stellantis announced what it described as its largest US investment push in its 100-year history, saying the $13bn cash injection would create 5,000 jobs across the midwestern United States. Stellantis told AFP that “as part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the US.” Unifor, Canada’s largest private-sector union representing thousands of autoworkers, said the model in question was the Jeep Compass, which will shift from a plant in Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois. Unifor leaders said the jobs were yet more casualties of Donald Trump’s trade war. “Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Lana Payne, Unifor’s national president, said in a statement, calling on Mark Carney’s government “to use Canada’s leverage now to fight for our auto jobs”. Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, called the announcement “painful” for workers. “I have spoken with Stellantis to stress my disappointment with their decision to prioritize investment in the US,” Ford said, also urging Carney “to stand up for the 157,000 workers in Ontario’s auto sector”. Reshoring auto jobs has been a central plank of Trump’s trade policy. Canada has been partly spared from his global auto sector tariffs through an existing North American trade pact. But the levies in place have created uncertainty for Canadian autoworkers. Carney, who met with Trump in Washington last week to advance trade talks, has expressed optimism about the prospects for a deal to cut tariffs in certain sectors such as aluminum, but a breakthrough on autos appears less promising. Reacting to the Stellantis announcement, Carney said the company’s decision was “a direct consequence of current US tariffs ”. He said his government would continue to prioritize investments “that will transform our economy from being overly reliant on our largest trade partner [the US]”. Rafael Gomez, an industrial relations experts at the University of Toronto, told AFP that Canada needs to be prepared for a steady loss of auto assembly jobs over the coming years. Trump will not relent on tariffs designed to ensure more cars are made in the US, Gomez said. “Think of the photo op – cutting a ribbon in front of the first new Jeep made in Illinois in years,” he added. Canada should prioritize being an essential provider of auto parts to serve US assembly plants, Gomez said. Stellantis told AFP it remains committed to Canada. “We have been in Canada for over 100 years, and we are investing,” the company said in a statement. “We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/canada-auto-stellantis-us-investment,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30ff5954526d83723c405e886dc104583851f2a/515_0_5152_4123/master/5152.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65231c33b2d87b380507c0a47fa9040f",2025-10-15T16:30:16+00:00,7c43eec10421932faa9695d6b4efd019e875a97f
7d06406e0281,‘Catholicism is reinventing itself’: Brazilians waking at 4am to stream prayers,,"P sychologist Cláudia Rodrigues de Oliveira Barbosa, 54, needs to be at work by 7.40am, but she wakes up at 3.40am – not because she has a lengthy commute, but to watch a “dawn prayer” livestream on YouTube. She is one of the millions of Brazilians who tune in to the 4am sermons of Catholic friar Gilson da Silva Pupo Azevedo, 38, known as Frei Gilson , who has recently averaged an impressive 2m daily views for each video. “Some people find it odd that I wake up so early to pray with him, but it’s a time when the house is quiet and you’re disconnected from the world,” said Barbosa, who lives with her husband and two teenage boys. The habit of rising early to watch prayer livestreams is growing rapidly in the country, which is home to the world’s largest Catholic population. Frei Gilson is the most prominent of a number of religious leaders who have become livestreamers, and experts say the trend suggests that Brazil may be a testing ground for religious influencers updating Catholic rituals to keep them alive. “The Catholic church is trying to renew itself through digital missionaries, and I would say that Brazil is a major exporter of ideas to the Catholic world,” said religion scholar Rodrigo Toniol, professor of anthropology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The shift comes at worrying moment for the church: census data released this year showed that while three decades ago Catholics made up 82.9% of Brazilians, they now account for just over half of the population. Even so, they still comprise 56.7% of the 213 million people, with the second-largest faith group – evangelicals – accounting for 26.9%. “I’ve always prayed the chaplet and the rosary since I was a child; but the dawn livestreams are new,” said Danielle de Freitas Silva, 40, a dentist who recently spent 40 consecutive days waking before sunrise to pray with Frei Gilson. “I’m exhausted, because its tough waking up at 4am and then carrying on with a normal work routine – with a young daughter … but in that moment I truly feel close to Jesus,” she added. Frei Gilson did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for an interview, but recently said on a podcast that he began the early morning prayers in 2020, as a personal penance during Lent: “Giving up sweets and soda no longer felt like much of a sacrifice, so I thought that I could give my sleep to God,” he said. His broadcasts have grown year by year, with some videos now surpassing 4m views. A recent 40-day rosary period dedicated to Saint Michael ended with a 4am event attended in person by 37,000 people in Cachoeira Paulista, and also livestreamed. YouTube did not release viewing figures but a spokesperson said that, particularly since 2024, “we have seen a real boom in live prayer broadcasts” in Brazil, which have experienced “exponential growth”. Evangelical leaders, such as Pastor Vinicius Iracet, 38, who has more than 11 million subscribers on his YouTube channel , have also embraced the trend Iracet said he has more Catholic than evangelical viewers, something relatively surprising given that some Brazilian Catholics are reluctant to consume Protestant content. “I don’t talk about religion, but about Christ and his word,” said Iracet, who also insisted he does not discuss politics: “I have my political views, but I don’t share them because I think it would create more problems than help those who follow me.” Frei Gilson was associated with the former president Jair Bolsonaro after being briefly mentioned in the police inquiry into the far-right leader’s attempted coup . The friar was allegedly the recipient of a “coup prayer” sent by one of those under investigation, but no link between him and the case was ever established. For researcher Magali Cunha of the NGO Institute for the Study of Religion , the apolitical character of most prayer livestreamers also explains their growth, after years of polarisation during which priests and pastors took increasingly outspoken political stances – usually in support of rightwing or far-right candidates. “Political disputes have divided families and churches … so many of the people joining the livestreams see these digital spaces as a chance to disconnect from this polarised world,” she said. Both Cunha and Toniol agree that the livestream prayers phenomenon, although amplified by social media, is in many ways an update of longstanding habits such as listening to sermons on the radio or spending the night in prayer. “As Catholicism loses some of its appeal and people no longer practice as much as before, the logic of these influencers is to ritualise people’s daily lives with a prayer, a hymn, a devotion,” said Toniol, who recently returned from a postdoctoral fellowship in Rome, where he attended a Vatican meeting for digital missionaries. “The Catholic church, this powerful 2,000-year-old institution, is a master at transforming itself to overcome crises … Phenomena such as that of Frei Gilson show that Brazil remains predominantly Catholic, and that Catholicism, far from dying, is reinventing itself,” he added.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/brazil-prayer-livestreams-catholic-church,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21600edb8660608de881022b79409c42d4355762/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70ff504b6c9c1732c36d9e20e5e8ac52",2025-10-15T09:00:32+00:00,bfaa2c000e13f4fc47072ef21c0a2e7e1afb8b55
76f4141b74f4,Trump threatens to cut US aid to Argentina if Milei loses election,,"Donald Trump has warned he could cut financial aid to Argentina if his ally Javier Milei loses crucial legislative elections later this month. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina ,” the US president said as Milei visited the White House to seek the Republican’s political and economic support. “I’m with this man because his philosophy is correct. And he may win and he may not win – I think he’s going to win. And if he wins we are staying with him, and if he doesn’t win we are gone.” Trump’s administration has already promised $20bn to prop up Argentina’s struggling economy but his backing has failed to calm the markets – or help Milei’s polling before midterms on 26 October. The results of the elections, in which Milei’s minority party is hoping to boost its seat tally, will dictate whether he can pass tough cost-cutting reforms or will face a legislative brick wall for the next two years of his term. Hailing Milei as a “great leader”, Trump said he would “fully endorse” his ideological ally in the elections. “He’s Maga all the way, it’s ‘Make Argentina Great Again,’” he added. Trump has, however, faced questions about how a big bailout for Argentina tallies with that same “America First” policy. Asked by reporters what the benefit to the United States was, Trump replied: “We are helping a great philosophy take over a great country. We want to see it succeed.” With Argentina struggling to stave off yet another financial crisis and Milei’s disapproval ratings rising, the country’s president has come to his rightwing ally Trump for help. Trump has repeatedly voiced political support for Milei, while backing it up with a promise of huge economic aid, but the markets remain spooked by Argentina. In recent weeks, the highly indebted country has had to spend more than $1bn to defend the peso, a strategy most economists believe is unsustainable. That prompted Milei’s allies in Washington to step in with a financial bailout. “Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity,” the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last week, announcing a $20bn deal. The announcement sparked a rally in Argentine bonds and stocks and helped ease pressure on the peso. It also marked a rare instance of direct US intervention in Latin American currency markets, underscoring Washington’s strategic interest in Milei’s success. In Argentina, there has been fevered speculation about what Trump might want from Milei in return for his support. Before Milei took power, Argentina – a major lithium producer – had been deepening ties with China. The Argentine president’s office said the leaders would discuss “multiple topics”. Trump also threatened trade penalties, including tariffs, against Spain on Tuesday, saying he was unhappy with its refusal to raise defence spending to 5% and calling the move disrespectful to Nato. “I’m very unhappy with Spain,” he told reporters at the White House. “They’re the only country that didn’t raise their number up to 5%. I was thinking of giving them trade punishment through tariffs because of what they did, and I think I may do that.” Nato leaders agreed in June to raise military spending to 5%, although the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, secured a last-minute exemption at the time, saying Spain would only spend up to 2.1%. Madrid has argued it compensates for the lower spending with strong troop contributions to Nato missions, including deployments in Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/trump-threatens-to-cut-us-aid-to-argentina-if-milei-loses-election,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d32b8954a0a3597f4500b6489e6d2da0280302/116_0_1996_1596/master/1996.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46e2499f32069cca1360fb3cf0424afa",2025-10-14T20:41:58+00:00,b133a18c2d40d40b68dc8684a4e6b3d4b192eda0
dc2cd6bef19a,Trump says six were killed in US strike on another boat allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela,,"Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has struck another small boat that he accuses of carrying drugs in waters off the coast of Venezuela , killing six people aboard. “The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike,” Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social social media platform. “No U.S. Forces were harmed.” Trump wrote that “intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics” and said that it was “associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks” but did not provide any evidence. Trump said that defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, ordered the strike on Tuesday morning and also shared video footage of the strike, as he has with prior strikes. This marks the fifth deadly US strike in the Caribbean, according to the Associated Press since the beginning of September , and comes just weeks after Trump administration officials said that the US is now in a “non international armed conflict” with drug cartels. An internal Trump administration memo obtained by the New York Times earlier this month reportedly stated that Trump has deemed cartels engaged in drug smuggling as “non-state armed groups” whose actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States”. The US has defendedthe boat strikes as countering “narco-terrorist” members of Tren de Aragua , which has been designated a foreign terrorist organization. The White House has argued that military action is a necessary escalation to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US. However, some lawmakers and human rights groups have questioned the legality of the attacks. In September, experts at the United Nations condemned the US strikes on small boats it believes to be trafficking drugs as extrajudicial executions. “International law does not allow governments to simply murder alleged drug traffickers,” the experts said. “Criminal activities should be disrupted, investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the rule of law, including through international cooperation.” Last week, Colombian president Gustavo Petro said that there were “indications” that one of the recently targeted boats was Colombian “and had Colombians onboard”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

a3533a59f549,Shein warns on Trump tariff uncertainty after profits slip,,"Shein has reported a 20% rise in global revenues to $37bn (£27.7bn) but profits have fallen as the fast-fashion retailer faced increased costs, even before it felt the impact of recent changes to US tax laws. The Singaporean parent company of the rapidly growing retailer said pre-tax profits had fallen by 13% to $1.3bn last year from $1.5bn in 2023 after an increase in selling and marketing costs, according to new accounts. Shein is thought to be trying to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange after efforts to list in the US and UK for an estimated £50bn valuation went awry. The China-founded online seller warned that changes to US tariff policies since April this year and their “frequent evolution” had “increased the level of uncertainties in the global economy”. It warned: “The ongoing evolution of trade policies continues to introduce complexities for businesses that may affect the group’s and the company’s future financial condition and operations.” Shein, which makes its revenues from selling goods and from fees on marketplace sellers, is thought to have taken a big hit to trade in the US this year after Donald Trump’s administration closed a loophole that allowed goods worth less than $800 to be imported and sent directly to shoppers without certain checks and duty. The de minimis exemption , which had been in place since 1938, was intended to foster growth for importers of small goods, latterly including e-commerce marketplaces. However, the exemption had been criticised for enabling the rapid growth of cheap imports from China via Shein and Temu. Income tax paid by the group remained steady at about $188m, although that included $6.1m deferred and adjusted tax relating to prior years. Shein’s UK arm has been accused of transferring the “vast bulk of income” to its Singaporean parent to cut its British tax bill. The company paid £9.6m in corporation tax in the UK despite making £2bn in sales last year. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

0e4aa01c5de2,Exiled Hong Kong dissidents fear UK plan to restart extraditions will put them in danger,,"Exiled Hong Kong dissidents say they fear UK government plans to restart some extraditions with the city could put them in greater danger, saying Hong Kong authorities will use any pretext to pursue them. An amendment to UK extradition laws was passed on Tuesday more than five years after Britain and several other countries suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong in response to the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, and its imposition of a Beijing-designed national security law. The UK Home Office says the suspension of the treaty made all extraditions with Hong Kong impossible “even if there were strong operational grounds” because it was still listed as a treaty state in the law. The amendment has redesignated Hong Kong as a non-treaty state, bringing it into line with other countries (including China) for extraditions assessed on a case-by-case basis. The security minister, Dan Jarvis, has said London will “never allow” extraditions for political purposes. All requests are assessed by courts, and subjects have the right to appeal. “This government is uncompromising in its commitment to human rights, the rule of law, and the protection of all individuals who reside in the United Kingdom, including the many Hongkongers who have chosen to make their lives here,” a Home Office spokesperson said. But dissidents and advocates say they fear Hong Kong authorities could exploit the ad hoc process to target political figures. About 220,000 Hongkongers with British national overseas status have fled to the UK, seeking residency. More have escaped to the US, Australia, Canada, and other countries, some as refugees. But Hong Kong has vowed to pursue overseas activists “to the end”, issuing arrest warrants and bounties for 38. “Even if the current government does not intend to hand us over, we need binding commitments that this will never happen under any future government,” said Chloe Cheung, of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation. Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician now living in exile in London, said UK assurances that requests must be “non-political” were easily undermined. “When you are the subject of an international arrest warrant and a bounty – a clear act of hostile state behaviour on UK soil – a statement of commitment is simply not enough.” Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have a track record for laying non-political charges against dissidents, sometimes to then switch out the allegation. Supporters of Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong media tycoon and leading pro-democracy activist, have labelled his lease fraud convictions as politically motivated and trumped up. Lai is on trial for national security offences. “The idea, after watching the Jimmy Lai show trial, that we should be sending anybody back to China is an absurdity,” said the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. Luke de Pulford, a co-founder of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, called for the government to offer a “dedicated and concrete appeal mechanism to ensure nothing slips through the cracks”. In 2021 the UK government reportedly warned activist s against travelling to countries with extraditions agreements with Hong Kong. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Feng is wanted in Hong Kong for allegedly supporting a “subversive” organisation. “Making such amendments is a clear indication that the UK government is willing to compromise and cooperate with Beijing,” he said. The amendment’s timing has also drawn suspicion, tabled amid continuing efforts by the UK to negotiate a trade deal with China, and a softer UK government approach towards Beijing. In 2020 Keir Starmer, then opposition leader, welcomed Boris Johnson’s suspension of the extradition treaty, labelling it “a step in the right direction”. Emily Lau, a veteran pro-democracy politician and former legislator who remains in Hong Kong, said there was “no doubt” the UK government needed to seek trade deals to address the state of its economy. “I have no problem with countries doing business, but the UK must not sacrifice the rights of the Hong Kong people,” she said. The Home Office said extraditions were governed “by strict legal safeguards and operates entirely independently of any trade negotiations or economic considerations”.",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/oct/15/exiled-hong-hong-dissidents-uk-restart-extraditions-danger,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac571235186139f8f4089033aeff79f1486d0873/1152_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0bf8ad680daa2edd101abe0a69f91c8e",2025-10-15T06:43:26+00:00,b620e64831c2510d1fd6be8e5e916549a0322e8a
fb2a9b97d04e,Xi directs quashing of Chinese feminists even as he praises advances at women’s conference,,"Addressing dignitaries gathered in Beijing on Monday, Xi Jinping praised the “historic achievements” of women’s rights in China. In the past 30 years, the Chinese president said, maternal mortality rates had dropped by nearly 80%, and women were now participating in the project of national governance with “unprecedented confidence and vigour”. Xi was speaking at the global women’s summit, an event on Monday and Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of the historic UN’s world conference on women , which took place in Beijing. It was there in 1995 that Hillary Clinton, the then US first lady, delivered her “women’s rights are human rights” speech, lines now often quoted by people in China advocating for women’s rights. This year, Chinese officials used Xi’s speech to highlight the contributions that China has made to women’s advancements. Xi announced a $10m (£7.5m) donation to UN Women , the organisation’s gender-equality agency, as well as a $100m fund for global south countries. But while Xi hailed a “glorious chapter of women’s progress”, in recent years, Chinese feminists have found it increasingly difficult to advocate for, or even speak about, women’s rights. “Today, countless people, primarily young women, identify as feminists and practice feminist choices in their personal lives,” said Lü Pin, an activist based in New Jersey who founded an influential feminist organisation in China that was forced to close in 2018. “However, feminist activities beyond personal life are severely limited, including public discussion, let alone policy advocacy, accountability and collective action,” said Lü, who has been based in the US since 2015, when several of her associates, known as the “feminist five”, were detained in China after a protest they staged about sexual harassment on public transport. As leader, Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society and led a patriarchal turn in politics. In 2022 he unveiled a new politburo, the executive body of the Chinese Communist party, which for the first time since 1997 included no women . Although social attitudes towards divorce and workplace equality have become more liberal, the government routinely exhorts women to fulfil what it says are traditional responsibilities of marriage and child-bearing, especially to help the country tackle its falling birthrate . In 2023, Xi said that China should “cultivate a new marriage and child-bearing culture”.

Photograph: Ken Ishii/AFP/Getty Images While organised feminist groups have mostly been squashed, there are still independent bloggers and commentators who focus on women’s issues. However, even these are under increasing pressure. Last month, the official WeChat account of feminist blogger Jiang Chan, whose articles regularly garnered more than 100,000 views, according to China Digital Times , was deleted. It came a few weeks after more than 1,300 accounts on Weibo, a separate social media platform with nearly 600 million monthly active users, were given temporary or permanent bans for inciting “gender antagonism”. One account was temporarily banned for posting “extreme anti-marriage” rhetoric. In June, the platform launched a dedicated complaints category for reporting content that “promotes gender antagonism”. Wang Huiling, a vlogger from rural Anhui province, shot to fame during the Covid-19 pandemic with her forthright videos about marriage, family and women’s independence. Her experience of coming from a village, where social norms are more conservative, stood in contrast to the more middle-class feminist discourse from China’s cities. “When I started posting videos online in 2019, I hadn’t heard of feminism,” she said. She just wanted to share the real-life struggles that she and the women around her faced in Chinese society. “It was only later that I realised I was part of the feminist community and that women fighting for their human rights were feminists.” At her peak, she had more than 4 million followers on Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, and, according to Wang, more than 6 million fans across different platforms. But Wang’s precise reach in China is now hard to gauge because, in January, all of her social media accounts were deleted without explanation. In April, she was informed that her 2021 memoir, Grassroots Women, had been banned from being reprinted (although it is still available for sale on e-commerce platforms). “I don’t know the specific reason for the ban, but it was probably because they were afraid of my awakening of independence in some women,” Wang said.

f4db7d23bc35,Japan’s baby boom among foreign-born population spotlights demographic timebomb,,"This week brought encouraging news for Japan ’s long battle to defuse its demographic timebomb: in 2024, the number of babies born to one sector of the population rose to a record of more than 22,000 – that’s about 3,000 more than the previous year and a 50% increase on a decade ago. But none of the women who answered calls – invariably issued by conservative male politicians – to have more children were Japanese. Despite the happy backdrop, the cries of babies born to women from China, Brazil, the Philippines and Vietnam reverberating around maternity wards was a reminder of the failure of successive governments to persuade Japanese couples to have bigger families . Births among Japanese parents stood at 686,000 babies, 41,000 fewer than in 2023, according to the data, released in the same week as figures showing that Japan’s foreign population is edging towards 4 million (3.2%) – a share of the 124 million population that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. The surge in migration has not happened by accident, and should not have been unexpected. It has been seven years since Japan’s then prime minister Shinzō Abe – hardly a liberal – recognised the need to accept more low-skilled workers to address labour shortages. Non-Japanese faces are no longer a novelty in towns and cities and, increasingly, in depopulated rural regions. Immigrants work in convenience stores, restaurants and factories, on building sites and in agriculture and fishing. Previous descriptions of Japan as a modern-day sakoku nation of self-imposed isolation, whose leaders refuse to lower the drawbridge to all but a few foreign workers, is clearly out of date. But the national debate over migration feels all too familiar, starting with the response to recent elections in which Sanseito , a minor party of the right, dramatically strengthened its presence in the upper house after vowing to put “Japanese first”. Sanseito now has 15 seats in a 248-seat chamber, in addition to three in the more powerful lower house. Its rise could – as some commentators suggested – be short-lived as voters, having registered their dissent, return to more mainstream parties. A snap general election notwithstanding, Sanseito and its leader, Sohei Kamiya, will have to wait until 2028 to build on the gains it made this summer, but it has already succeeded in setting the tone of the debate on immigration. All of the major parties, including those on the centre left, have voiced concern over foreign workers, while the governing Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has vowed to bring illegal immigration down to zero and ensure that guest workers do more to integrate. During the LDP’s recent contest to elect a new leader, the winner, Sanae Takaichi , opened her campaign with a broadside against badly behaved foreign tourists, claiming without evidence that she had personally witnessed a visitor assault one of the sacred deer in Nara, where she is an MP. Other politicians have tapped into claims that foreign migrants are taking jobs from Japanese workers and are more likely to commit crimes – neither of which are supported by evidence. The debate occasionally spills over into xenophobia. In Kawaguchi, near Tokyo, Kurdish residents are the targets of hate speech and misinformation. Authorities in four regional cities were recently forced to clarify that a now-cancelled friendship initiative with African countries would not lead to an influx of workers from Mozambique, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. At a ski resort in Hokkaido, locals are protesting against plans to build lodgings for more than 1,000 seasonal workers, many of whom are foreign, drafted in to work in tourism and construction. There are signs, though, that economic necessity will eclipse the political rhetoric and migration will continue to accelerate at a pace that could see foreigners comprise more than 10% of the population in 15 years’ time – three decades sooner than previously forecast. That would please business leaders polled by the Nikkei business paper in September, almost all of whom said migrant workers were the vital link in a supply chain that would strain to breaking point without them. While Japan’s employers have answered the migrant worker question in the affirmative, the choice between economic decline and a more diverse population is one the country’s politicians continue to dodge.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/japans-imported-baby-boom-spotlights-a-political-and-demographic-timebomb,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/028cce1f992364b625b30fa5855ee58b28c59326/2502_1121_4739_3791/master/4739.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0cd1872b03fd27cab1bd59f13989f96",2025-10-14T23:31:43+00:00,c45fc41812866c5e04d2c47aca4b3ac47b1c70ba
9161bced7837,US raised concerns about Chinese boss of chipmaker before Dutch takeover,,"US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of a China-owned chipmaker before it was taken over by the Dutch government this week, according to court papers. The documents show US officials warned the Netherlands in June that Nexperia may not be able to export to the US if its Chinese chief executive, Zhang Xuezheng, remained in post. Late on Sunday the Dutch government said it had invoked a cold war-era law to effectively take control of the company, citing “major shortcomings that could jeopardise security of supply” of chips to European factories. By that point Zhang had been suspended from Nexperia, which is controlled by the Chinese company Wingtech. It has now emerged that the US had raised concerns about Nexperia’s management as far back as June. A preliminary court ruling released on Tuesday included minutes of a meeting from 12 June in which the US Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation told the Dutch foreign ministry: “The fact that the company’s CEO is still the same Chinese owner is problematic … It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced.” Washington put Wingtech on its “entity list” of companies seen as a threat to national security last year, for its alleged role in “aiding China’s government’s efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capacity”. Wingtech, which is 30% owned by Chinese national and regional governments and affiliated investment funds, bought the Dutch chipmaker in 2018 from the Dutch consumer electronics company Philips. On 30 September, that entity list was expanded to include company subsidiaries, which meant Nexperia would be hit by its restrictions by the end of November. In an extraordinary move, the Dutch government revealed on Sunday that it had taken control of the Nijmegen-headquartered chipmaker, citing worries about the possible transfer of technology to Wingtech. That has heightened tensions with Beijing, with Nexperia saying it is now in negotiations with the US to remove barriers to exports. On Tuesday, China also prohibited Nexperia and its subcontractors from exporting components assembled in China as tensions with the US escalated. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the central committee of the Chinese Communist party, described the takeover as “robbery in legal disguise”, warning that the west was using “national security” as an excuse for its failures to keep up with the Chinese. “China’s scientific and technological progress has profoundly shaken the nerves of western hegemony,” it said. The Dutch intervention comes 18 months after the UK government ordered Wingtech to sell its 86% stake in a silicon chip plant in Newport in Wales , the largest chip plant in the country, amid security concerns. Wingtech called the Dutch government’s intervention in Nexperia “excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Dutch economy minister Vincent Karremans told the Dutch broadcaster NOS: “I recently received serious and urgent signals that the company has major shortcomings that could jeopardise security of supply. “This would have major consequences for the European and Dutch economies.” The Dutch invoked never-before-used powers under a Dutch law known as the “Availability of Goods Act”, which does not give it ownership but gives it the power to reverse or block management decisions it considers harmful. It also points out that it has several subsidiaries in Europe, including wafer production facilities in Manchester and Hamburg. The Amsterdam commercial court ruling in a “preliminary opinion” that there were “well-founded reasons to doubt the correct policy and correct conduct of affairs” were being pursued by the company.

579df3771ba1,‘This is bad news’: Australian tropical rainforest trees switch in world first from carbon sink to emissions source,,"Australian tropical rainforest trees have become the first in the world to switch from being a carbon sink to an emissions source due to increasingly extreme temperatures and drier conditions. The change, which applies to the trees’ trunk and branches but not the roots system, began about 25 years ago, according to new research published in Nature. Trees store carbon as they grow and release it when they decay and die. Overall, tropical forests are thought to be carbon sinks – absorbing more CO 2 than they release – and uptake is assumed to increase amid rising atmospheric concentration. But nearly 50 years of data collected from tropical forests across Queensland has revealed this crucial carbon sink could be under threat. About 25 years ago, tree trunks and branches in those forests became a net emitter, with more trees dying and insufficient new growth, according to the research. “It’s the first tropical forest of its kind to show this symptom of change,” said lead author, Dr Hannah Carle from Western Sydney University. “We know that the moist tropics in Australia occupy a bit of a warmer, drier climate space than tropical forests on other continents, and therefore it might serve as a future analog for what tropical forests will experience in other parts of the world.” Prof Adrienne Nicotra from Australian National University, a co-author of the study, said it remained to be seen whether Australia’s tropical forests were a harbinger for other tropical forests globally, and further research was needed. But if so, the findings could have significant implications for global climate models, carbon budgets and climate policies. “This paper is the first time that this tipping point of a switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source in tropical rainforests has been identified clearly – not just for one year, but for 20 years,” said Prof David Karoly, an emeritus professor at the University of Melbourne and an expert in climate change science. Karoly, who was not involved in the research, said on a global scale, the share of carbon dioxide absorbed by forests, trees, and plants had been quite stable over the last 20 to 30 years, which was assumed to continue under many climate models and policies. But if similar shifts – from sink to source – were observed in other rainforests, climate projections may underestimate global warming in future . “Which is bad news,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But their reduced capacity to absorb extra carbon would make emissions cuts “a lot harder”, and require an even more rapid transition away from fossil fuels . The analysis drew on a unique set of forest data dating back to 1971, including records tracking roughly 11,000 trees across 20 forest sites in Queensland . It considered the carbon stored above ground in tree trunks and branches, but not the gains and losses below ground from soil and roots. Dr Raphael Trouve, who studies forest dynamics at the University of Melbourne and was not involved in the study, said the research highlighted the value of collecting and maintaining long term data. Trouve’s own research published earlier this year, which found mountain ash forests were thinning rapidly under drier and hotter conditions, relied on a different 50-year dataset collected in Victorian forests. The surprising findings in tropical rainforests showed the value of the data in quantifying changes in the environment, he said. “We thought the forest would be able to store more carbon because [CO 2 ] is increasing. But looking at these long term empirical datasets, we find that is not the case – it allows us to confront the theory with reality and better understand how these systems work.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/16/australian-tropical-rainforest-trees-switch-carbon-sink-emissions-source,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54120e0923830b518c7b398c220eea8fa31322e4/469_0_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b15ab6dbddd64cd47c9d3ceaaf92ac6",2025-10-15T15:00:39+00:00,3702b3d3534c6130aef24e807e21d9360fb04d7e
11f8d66823ea,"Expanding Asio’s interrogation powers could leading to ‘fishing expeditions’, critics say",,"Labor’s moves to expand Asio’s compulsory questioning powers could lead to “fishing expeditions” against individuals not charged with any crime and risk permanently damaging human rights, civil liberties groups warn. The federal government is planning on making the domestic spy agency’s powers for compulsory questioning permanent, while also significantly expanding the offences covered by the rules. Introduced in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, the compulsory questioning powers would cover sabotage, promotion of communal violence, attacks on the defence system and serious threats to Australia’s border security. But legislation introduced to parliament by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke , would also end so-called sunset provisions – the effective expiry dates that require parliament to reconsider the powers on a regular basis. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, intelligence operatives have powers to issue a questioning warrant, requiring a person as young as 14 to give information or produce items that may assist in a serious investigation. The powers are being temporarily extended, for 18 months, to allow parliament to consider a permanent expansion. Asio has hardly used the powers since 2020. Just four warrants were served on three people, in counter-terror and espionage cases, in that time. Guardian Australia revealed in July a review of the legislation was under way by parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security. In a joint submission, Liberty Victoria and the New South Wales and Queensland councils for civil liberties say the plan would seriously diminish the right to a fair trial and risk Asio being characterised as a secret police force, rather than an intelligence agency. They say the laws would unfairly allow the government to force an innocent person to undergo compulsory questioning, with their answers available for use by prosecutors. “This creates an incentive for the executive to conduct ‘fishing expeditions’ against individuals who could not otherwise be investigated under ordinary criminal procedure,” their submission said. It noted a 2016 review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor had recommended the powers be repealed or allowed to lapse. The NSW Council for Civil Liberties’ president, Timothy Roberts, said the powers should be withdrawn. “Any government interested in maintaining its identity as ‘democratic’ would not have laws with such far-reaching powers,” he said. “It is alarming with all the recent international examples of the dangers of this type of overreach, our government has chosen not to shore up its citizens rights, and instead erode them.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are found in no other liberal democracy and must not be made permanent,” he said. Asio has told the committee the questioning powers were a “unique and critical tool” for investigating threats. The agency said the country faced “more security surprises” in the next five years than what has occurred in the past few years. Espionage and foreign interference were at unprecedented levels, it said, while political violence represents an “elevated concern” amid growing political polarisation. It also warned sabotage will pose an increasing challenge to authorities and could quickly escalate, and insisted powers to question minors were warranted. “Given the increase in the prevalence of minors in Asio’s terrorism caseload – all attacks and major counter-terrorism disruptions in 2024 involved minors or young people – the numbers of minors being radicalised online, and the way minors are moving towards violence more quickly, Asio considers the retention of these powers is necessary and proportionate to the potential threat to security.” The organisation offered a hypothetical scenario to illustrate its use of the powers, in which an Australian citizen was helping organise a people-smuggling operation offshore. In the scenario, the individual refuses to answer questions after returning to Australia, before being compelled under the laws. Their answers see a people-smuggling boat stopped before it reaches Australia. The home affairs department called the powers “a vital capability for Asio in its mission to protect Australia and Australians from threats to their security”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/expanding-asio-interrogation-powers-damage-human-rights-activists-warn,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c0efa5ffeceff7f524094b20ac59b67c947ba4/472_0_4718_3775/master/4718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ee6badfc2d498fe61531741a1372dbe",2025-10-15T14:00:39+00:00,2809b9d9deee4f85712d9dbdd52e54a95366fa3d
a98d474e1abb,Westpac makes it harder for younger customers to earn advertised interest rates,,"Westpac is tightening conditions on its savings account for younger customers as growing numbers of banks make it harder to earn advertised interest rates on their deposits. The bank has joined smaller competitors in changing interest-related restrictions on some accounts – despite the Reserve Bank of Australia leaving interest rates on hold in September . Conditional accounts, such as Westpac’s Life account, help banks access customers’ money and finance their lending business at a discount, according to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission analysis, because two in three savers miss out on their headline interest rate . In November, Westpac will quadruple the number of transactions required to achieve the full 5% rate for 18 to 29-year-olds with Life accounts, from five a month to 20. Customers who fail to deposit and increase their balance each month already see their interest slashed to just 0.25%. Savers who meet those conditions but make fewer than 20 payments from a linked spending account will see their rate drop to 4.25%. The changes push customers who spend and save with different institutions to move all their banking to Westpac, according to Andrew Grant, associate professor at the University of Sydney business school. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The only way you’re going to get [the 5% rate] without making a conscious, costly, time-consuming effort [to] achieve that goal is by just using it as your main bank,” Grant said. Westpac holds about a fifth of all Australian households’ deposits and about a fifth of home loans. Locking in younger customers would deliver Westpac more future home loan business, while deterring savers from shopping around for better rates at other banks, reducing competition, Grant said. Some customers, deterred by the difficulty of reorganising their finances, told Guardian Australian they planned to focus their spending on the bank. “I could change my savings setup so I don’t use this Westpac account that has that condition, but I think it’s more likely I’d have to just be very vigilant,” one 21-year-old student, who did not wish to be identified, said. The changes will also broaden account eligibility to include 18 to 34-year-olds. A Westpac spokesperson said the changes would ensure those who chose to spend and save with the bank were rewarded. Restrictive conditions have become more common in Australia over the past 20 years and now apply to more than half of the savings options in online database Finder . While Westpac is the only bank requiring 20 transactions, nine other banks now require savers to spend each month to get their full interest, according to the financial comparison site Mozo. Bar chart showing how banks have slashed the base interest for savings Over the past decade, banks have reduced the base interest component on conditional accounts while making their no-strings alternatives less attractive. While bonus accounts in September offered annual interest of 4.05%, as they did in 2013, regular accounts offered just 1.3%, compared to 2.35% in 2013, RBA data shows. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From October, Ubank customers will receive no interest unless they deposit more than they withdraw each month. Customers had previously only been required to deposit $500, which they could withdraw as they wished. Interest tiers have also been simplified to apply to balances up to $1m. The Ubank chief product officer, Andrew Morrison, said the changes made accounts easier to use and responded to customers’ desires to grow their savings. Others have tightened existing restrictions, with AMP and Unity upping the amounts by which customers must grow their accounts in 2025, according to Canstar analysis. Up, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s youth brand, began requiring that customers avoid withdrawing money or face slashed interest as part of a package of changes in September. The bank’s chief executive, Xavier Shay, said the changes were in response to customer demands. Stricter requirements make it more costly for customers to access their money, according to Andrew Hingston, lecturer in personal finance at the University of New South Wales. “Even withdrawing a small amount, like $200 to pay a bill … you’re forgoing quite a bit of interest to do that,” Hingston said. “Not having a requirement to grow, that was a lot more flexible, a much better system.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/westpac-makes-it-harder-for-younger-customers-to-earn-advertised-interest-rates,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df53a4b69dea7d46c9e0d7ddb4d43cb950ce7013/697_0_4583_3668/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43b703c04e91d570a2dde0727232be2c",2025-10-15T14:00:39+00:00,bea4cce18881ae283a9260371a87d785125d3072
274296860db9,Lehrmann fights to safeguard personal diaries seized during anti-corruption raid over ‘James Bond-like allegations’,,"Former political staffer Bruce Lehrmann is fighting to safeguard personal diaries that were seized during a raid on his home by the anti-corruption watchdog. The National Anti-Corruption Commission raided his home in June 2024 amid an investigation into claims he misappropriated secret documents related to French submarines. Lehrmann denies the allegation and claims investigators seized only two handwritten personal diaries during the raid. The former political staffer told the federal court the diaries contained confidential information that should not be disclosed due to a claim of legal professional privilege. “Those diaries ... may become an issue. It’s my concern that they’re held by [NACC Commissioner Paul Brereton],” Lehrmann said on Wednesday. “My submission would be that they should be held by an independent party and quarantined.” But commission lawyer Bora Kaplan said his client had not received a claim of legal professional privilege from Lehrmann. Justice Brigitte Markovic said she was not sure she had the power to make the orders sought by Lehrmann, and suggested he communicate with the commission about the diaries. “If it’s necessary to raise the matter in court, that can be done in due course,” she said. Lehrmann is suing Brereton and federal Labor government minister Don Farrell over the legal costs he incurred during the investigation into what he described as “frivolous, James Bond-like allegations”. He claims he was repeatedly told he was entitled to funding for legal representation to defend himself during the investigation, but he still has not received any money. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Justice Brigitte Markovic noted it has been a year without a decision from the Nacc on whether funding would be provided. She ordered mediation between Lehrmann and Farrell be held before 1 December in hopes of speeding the process along. Lehrmann welcomed the move, which he believes could be successful in resolving his dispute with the minister. “This is the second time I’ve proposed mediation with [Farrell]. On both occasions, I’ve been refused,” he said. “If funding had been granted, we may not even be here, and if we can seek a resolution through mediation, then there’ll be no need to pursue action as against [Farrell].” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lehrmann reminded Justice Markovic that she did not need their consent to order mediation, prompting her to reply: “I’m well aware of my powers, Mr Lehrmann.” The judge ordered the mediation be resolved by 1 December and set the matter down for a one-day hearing in February. Lehrmann agreed to the timetable, noting that if mediation was successful he would be in “no rush necessarily” to ventilate his claims against Brereton. The former political staffer, who is “impecunious and in serious financial peril”, hopes to receive the requested funding so he can be represented by lawyers at the hearing. The former political staffer is accused of gathering the confidential information in March 2019, only days after he was alleged to have raped his colleague Brittany Higgins in Parliament House. He has denied the claims, which remain untested in a criminal court after a 2022 trial in the ACT was abandoned due to juror misconduct. The federal court’s Justice Michael Lee found in 2024 the allegations he raped Higgins were proven on the balance of probabilities and dismissed his defamation suit against Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson.

Police say they hold “grave fears” for Peter Willoughby who wandered into bushland in Hollybank forest reserve, in the state’s north-east, on 5 October. Separately, bushwalker Daryl Fong, 30, went missing while hiking in Mount Field national park, in Tasmania’s south-east, over the weekend. Police resumed searching for Willoughby on Wednesday after efforts were paused last Friday due to poor weather posing a risk for rescuers in the dense bushland. Search and rescue teams returned to Hollybank forest reserve to scour the area for Willoughby. Police officers and SES personnel searched previously examined areas and ventured south from the bushwalker’s last known location. Map showing location of Hollybank forest reserve in Tasmania. The Tasmania Police Northern Search and Rescue Inspector, Nick Clark, said despite the extensive searching over the past 10 days Willoughby was not located. “We remain determined to find Mr Willoughby, but given the length of time he has been missing, and the inclement weather conditions in the area, police hold serious concerns for his welfare,” he said. Willoughby, from Scottsdale, was reported missing on the afternoon of 5 October, after he went walking in the thick forest near Hollybank. Police previously said he was in the area to retrieve his silver Subaru Outback station wagon, which had become stuck on a nearby road the prior week. While retrieving the car on 5 October with others he became separated from the group. The elderly man is being treated for a medical condition, which can result in him sometimes becoming disoriented, police said.

0e3d189a81bb,Russian drone incursion ‘tactically stupid and counterproductive’ says Polish minister,,"Poland’s foreign minister has accused Russia of a “tactically stupid and counterproductive” escalation of the war in Ukraine, saying its drone incursion into Poland last month appeared to be deliberate. Radosław Sikorski, on a visit to London, said all Vladimir Putin had achieved with the incursion was a consolidation of western opinion against him. He also dismissed Russian concerns that supplying US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine would be unnecessarily provocative. The move by Russia had involved 21 drones in a seven-hour incursion in early September, forcing the closure of airports in the east and centre of the country. “We think the preponderance of evidence suggests that it was deliberate,” Sikorski said. “They were launched from a single location, and they were all unarmed. If this was an accidental offshoot of that night’s attack on Ukraine, you would expect the mix of drones to be the same, some armed, some unarmed. All the ones that crossed into Poland were unarmed,” he said. The drones, understood to be Russian-made Gerbera decoys, were launched from Russia, in an incursion that was “seemingly coordinated with Belarus”, he said. It was, he added, partly a test of Poland and Nato’s air defences, forcing Poland and Nato allies to respond by scrambling fighter jets and other air defences. Sikorski was speaking before a planned meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, at which the defence of Europe’s eastern flank and supply of drones to Ukraine will be discussed. After the Polish incursion, Nato allies agreed to supply further jets for air policing as part of an operation called Eastern Sentry. According to a leaked defence paper to be published on Thursday, the European Commission will also call for European drone defences to be “fully functional by the end of 2027” as part of a project previously known as the “drone wall”. The Polish drone incident is one of several incursions into Nato airspace by Russia in September, with Russian drones also sighted in the Baltic states, Romania and Norway, and potentially elsewhere in Scandinavia. Sikorski said the incursions were a reminder that Putin believed he was “at war with us” – a situation that he argued dated back in the Russian president’s mind to the 2006 Alexander Litvinenko poisoning and his combative speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference. “He’s been at war with us, but we didn’t acknowledge it because it seemed too preposterous and too strange,” Sikorski said. The incursion into Poland was part of a “spectrum of provocations”, he said, including poisonings, sabotage and arson attacks, such as incendiary bombs at parcel sites in Poland, Germany and the UK.

Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters Though Putin was “probing”, Sikorski said, the incursions and other hybrid threats had been “tactically stupid and counterproductive for him. What is he achieving? He is achieving the consolidation of public support for a policy of deterrence against Russia.” Donald Trump is expected to discuss whether to supply Ukraine with US Tomahawks, which have a range of more than 1,000 miles, in a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that the issue was of “extreme concern” to Russia. But Sikorski said concerns about the conflict spreading were exaggerated. “Every time we intended to give Ukraine new missiles, new types of weapons, somebody said: ‘Don’t do it, it’s escalatory. Don’t send them tanks. Don’t send them MiG fighters. Don’t send them F-16s. Don’t give them Himars [rockets] don’t give them Atacms [missiles].’ And every time Russia has had to adjust.” The Tomahawks, Sikorski said, could be used to target Russian oil refineries, the subject of recent Ukrainian drone strikes. “Russia’s vastness means that you don’t have enough anti-aircraft assets to protect all the targets,” he said, noting Ukraine was having success in reducing Russia’s capacity to produce oil. “When you achieve success you should reinforce it.” Sikorski said that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, had been “whispering into Trump’s ear that Russia always wins”. However, the Polish minister said that Russia had been defeated in Crimea in the 19th century, in the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, in the first world war, against Poland in 1920 and more recently in Afghanistan. “Only when Russia loses a war are there any reforms,” Sikorski said. “If Russia lost the war it would be good for Ukraine, it would be good for Europe, but it would also be good for Russia.” The Polish minister was in the UK for routine meetings, including with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, and Jonathan Powell, Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. He also visited parliament, where he helped unveil a decommissioned Shahed-136 drone at an event organised by United Against Nuclear Iran. The UK on Wednesday announced fresh sanctions against Russia, targeting its two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, and 51 “shadow fleet” oil tankers, in what it described as a new attempt to tighten energy sanctions and choke off the Kremlin’s revenues. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Washington would be willing to work with European countries on steeper sanctions. The drone wall idea , proposed by the EU executive, envisaged a system of “anti-drone capabilities for detection, tracking, and neutralisation, as well as capabilities to hit ground targets leveraging drone technology for precision strikes” according to a draft defence roadmap seen by the Guardian. However, EU sources said the name “drone wall” would be dropped to help the initiative win broader support. EU leaders will be asked to endorse the defence roadmap at a Brussels summit on 23 October as part of a drive to ensure the continent can defend itself from foreign invasion by 2030 . The idea originated in the Baltic states, but has met scepticism farther west. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said something “a little more sophisticated and complex was needed”. In Germany, where the word “wall” has an unhappy historical resonance, senior politicians have cast doubt on the idea, while endorsing drone defence. To help win broader geographical support, EU officials argue drone defences could help protecting borders and infrastructure, combating organised crime.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/russian-drone-incursion-tactically-stupid-and-counterproductive-says-polish-minister,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be6f637a1b097a56a2549eec4506a935923e764/541_51_4391_3513/master/4391.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=856bb1384ec4a2258489bb919e29671c",2025-10-15T16:03:14+00:00,4a2b89b7087d29d6d7cdc236922e5a18c821e99c

Unleashed on the UK by Brexit, this was unprecedented political turmoil. So how might we describe what is happening in France , now on its fifth (or sixth, depending how you count) premier in two years – three of them in the past 10 months? The latest prime minister, the recently reappointed Sébastien Lecornu, may have bought himself a stay of execution on Tuesday , sacrificing Emmanuel Macron’s flagship pensions overhaul in exchange for opposition Socialist votes as the price for his government’s survival. But it is, at best, a temporary fix. The EU’s second-largest economy is locked in a political permacrisis, the likes of which it has not seen for decades – perhaps not since the start of its Fifth Republic in 1958 – and from which there appears no easy escape. We’ll look at the reasons for that, as well as what might follow over the coming weeks and years, shortly. First, let’s recap. Minority rule Essential context: ever since Macron called an ill-advised snap general election in 2024, France has had a hung parliament divided into three warring blocs – left, far right and his own centre-right alliance – none with anything close to a majority. At the same time, the country faces dual debt and deficit crises : its debt-to-GDP ratio and budget shortfall are now almost twice the EU limit, and hard constitutional deadlines to pass a 2026 budget that at least begins to rein in spending are nigh. Against that unforgiving backdrop, both Lecornu’s immediate predecessors as French prime minister – Michel Barnier, who lasted from September to December 2024, and François Bayrou, who took office from December 2024 to September 2025 – were ousted by parliament . In mid-September, the president appointed his close ally Lecornu as his latest PM . But when, a little over two weeks ago, Lecornu unveiled his new cabinet – which turned out to be much the same as the old one – he faced fury from allies and opponents alike. So much so that the next day, he resigned . After just 27 days in office, Lecornu became the shortest-lived premier in modern French history . In a dignified speech, he blamed political intransigence, saying “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” would make his job all but impossible. Another twist in the tale … Sébastien Lecornu delivers a statement after his resignation. Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/AFP/Getty Images Then, another twist in the tale: just hours after Lecornu’s resignation, Macron asked him to stay on for another 48 hours in a last-ditch effort to salvage cross-party backing – a task, to put it mildly, not without complications. Next, two of Macron’s former PMs publicly turned on the embattled president . Meanwhile, the far-right National Rally (RN) and radical left France Unbowed (LFI) refused to meet Lecornu, promising to vote down any and every new government unless there were snap elections. Lecornu stuck at his job, talking to everyone who was prepared to hear him out. At the end of his 48 hours, he went on TV to say he believed “a path still existed” to avoid elections. Macron’s office confirmed the president would appoint a new prime minister two days later. Macron kept his promise – and on Friday appointed … Sébastien Lecornu, again . So this week – with Macron helpfully sniping from the sidelines that the country’s rival political parties were “fuelling division” and “solely responsible for this chaos” – was Lecornu’s moment of truth. Could he survive – and can he pass that vital budget? In a high-stakes speech, the 39-year-old PM spelled out his budget priorities, giving the centre-left Socialist party (PS), who detest Macron’s unpopular pension overhaul, what they were waiting for: Macron’s flagship reform would be frozen until 2027. With the conservative Les Républicains (LR) already on board, the Socialists said they would not back no-confidence motions tabled against Lecornu by the far right and radical left – meaning the government should survive those votes, due on Thursday. It is, however, by no means certain to be able to pass its planned €30bn budget squeeze: the PS explicitly warned that it would be seeking more concessions. “This,” said its leader, Olivier Faure, “is just the start.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And, like the PS, the conservatives are themselves divided over how to handle the new government – some are still itching to topple it. A glance at the parliamentary arithmetic shows how tough Lecornu’s task – and longer-term survival – will be. A total of 264 deputies from the far-right RN, radical-left LFI, Greens, Communists and hardline-right UDR want him out. To achieve that, they need a majority of 288 votes in parliament – so if they can persuade just 24 of the PS’s 69 deputies or the LR’s 47 (or both) to vote with them, Macron’s fifth precarious prime minister in two years is, like his predecessors, toast. Few would bet against that happening sooner rather than later. Even if, by some miracle, the dysfunctional assembly summons up the collective responsibility to pass a budget by year-end, the prospects for the government beyond that look bleak. So is there a way out? Snap elections would be unlikely to solve the problem: polls suggest pretty much every party bar the RN would lose seats, but there would still be no clear majority. A new prime minister would face the same intractable arithmetic. Uncertain future … polls suggest Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella to be the next occupant of the Élysée Palace. Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/Reuters Another possibility might be for Macron himself to resign. After winning the presidential election, his successor would dissolve parliament and hope to secure a parliamentary majority in the ensuing legislative vote. But that, too, is uncertain. Polls suggest the next occupant of the Elysée Palace will be Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella. There is at least an odds-on chance that France’s voters, having elected a far-right president, might think twice about handing them control of parliament. Ultimately, France may not emerge from its quagmire until its politicians accept the new political reality, which is that clear majorities are a thing of the past, winner-takes-all no longer applies, and compromise is not synonymous with failure. Many think that cultural shift will not be possible under the country’s current constitution. “This is no conventional parliamentary crisis, but a crise de régime” that will prove anything but temporary, wrote historian Pierre Purseigle . “The regime … was never designed to facilitate – and even disincentivises – the emergence of governing coalitions common in the rest of Europe ,” Purseigle says. “ The Fifth Republic may well have entered its terminal phase.” To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here .",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/frances-parliamentary-quagmire-is-the-dawning-of-a-new-political-reality,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a18a85ef15311969212b52876092783acaaaae/337_0_5009_4007/master/5009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92fefc149079e5887735e2d47c84d29d",2025-10-15T14:30:38+00:00,8a0f27e63a717d1691fdcabcd6c6847a53bfafdb

US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday urged allies to ramp up investment in the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, which replaced US arms donations to Ukraine and now requires allies to pay for US weapons deliveries. He told reporters before a meeting at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels: You get peace when you are strong.

The EU is pressing to have a new system of anti-drone defences fully up and running by the end of 2027, officials told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday, as part of a push to ward off Russia. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen first called to create a “drone wall” to counter Moscow last month, hours after Nato jets shot down Russian unmanned aircraft in Poland. Sergiy Petrovich Lysak has been appointed as the head of the Odesa city military administration, as confirmed by an order on the website for the president of Ukraine on Wednesday. The move comes after Zelenskyy on Tuesday revoked the citizenship of Odesa’s mayor on the grounds that he also had a Russian passport, acting to end the tenure of a divisive figure who has run the Black Sea port city for 11 years. Russia struck Ukrainian power infrastructure with drones overnight, knocking out electricity supplies in several areas including in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, the Ukrainian Energy Ministry said on Wednesday. Power grid operator Ukrenergo said power supplies were limited in seven regions, most in the east. State-run gas firm Naftogaz said a thermal power plant had been hit, without identifying the plant. Germany will spend €10bn ($11.6bn) in coming years for all kinds of drones, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said at a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. He also said that Germany will offer to take the lead in an EU air defence shield and that Germany will increase its contribution to air policing. Belgium’s defence minister Theo Francken said on Wednesday the Belgian and Dutch governments will sign a missile defence systems agreement. Francken told reporters on Wednesday ahead of a meeting with Nato defence ministers: “We will sign an agreement with the Netherlands to have … (a) missile defence system. It will be the NASAMS system, the Norwegian System. We will buy NASAMS to protect our skies.” After winning a major concession on pension reform from prime minister Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Socialists on Wednesday set their sights on including a tax on billionaires in the 2026 budget as talks over its passage began in parliament. Lecornu told lawmakers on Wednesday he would propose in November an amendment to the social security financing law in order to suspend a landmark pension reform until after the 2027 election, sacrificing one of president Emmanuel Macron’s legacy achievements to ensure the survival of his minority government. An Austrian court on Wednesday sentenced fallen property tycoon Rene Benko to two years in prison for insolvency fraud, the first conviction in a wide-ranging investigation into the collapse of his real-estate empire. Benko, once one of Austria’s richest men, founded Signa Holding in 2000, but the debt-laden group crumbled in 2023 in the largest insolvency proceedings in the country’s history. Riot police scuffled with medical staff at an Athens public hospital on Wednesday during a protest over the state of public health services held during a visit to the facility by prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Police in riot gear fired volleys of pepper spray and used shields and batons to push away doctors at the University general hospital Attikon who were demanding to meet with Mitsotakis, local media reported. Greece’s parliament on Wednesday debated a controversial reform proposed by the conservative government, which would allow 13-hour workdays under exceptional circumstances, drawing fire from unions and opposition parties. Unions have staged two general strikes against the reform this month, the latest on Tuesday, with thousands of workers protesting a bill “worthy of the Middle Ages,” according to the left-wing Syriza party, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The government insists that the 13-hour workday is optional, only affects the private sector, and can only be applied up to 37 days a year. Labour minister Niki Kerameus argued in parliament: We are now giving the possibility (to an employee) to perform this extra work for the same employer, without commuting, with increased pay of 40%. The reform is seen as targeted towards Greece’s services sector, especially during the busy summer tourism season, enabling employers to avoid hiring additional staff. But opposition parties and unions argue that workers will risk layoffs if they refuse longer hours. Stefanos Chatziliadis, a senior member of civil service union ADEDY, told AFP during a Tuesday protest in Thessaloniki: Our health, both mental and physical, and the balance between personal and professional life are goods that cannot be replaced with money. Making it legal to work from morning till night is not normal and cannot be tolerated by our society. It is truly barbaric. It is inhuman. An American tourist was killed and another was seriously wounded on Wednesday morning during a knife attack in Portugal, police said, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The attack happened in the seaside resort of Cascais west of the capital, Lisbon. A Portuguese police spokesperson told AFP: One of the tourists died at the scene and the other suffered serious injuries to the face and arm. The surviving tourist was taken to hospital in Lisbon, media reported. Three people suspected of carrying out the attack escaped in a vehicle and have not yet been found. “We have circulated to all our officers the necessary information to find the suspects,” the police said.

Photograph: Leonhard Föger/Reuters Benko, 48, was accused of concealing assets amounting to €660,000 (about $770,000) at the expense of creditors in the course of the insolvency. At the two-day trial in the city of Innsbruck, Benko was found guilty of one count of insolvency fraud for gifting €300,000 (about $350,000) to his mother in late 2023. The court sentenced him to two years in prison. It acquitted him on the second count, an alleged advance payment of about €360,000 for the rent and operating expenses of a villa that prosecutors deemed “economically unjustifiable”. The conviction can still be appealed. Benko has been in custody since being arrested at his villa in Innsbruck in January. He has denied all accusations of wrongdoing. During the trial, he branded the prosecution’s allegations “the height of cynicism”.

The prime minister was threatened by two no-confidence motions filed by hard-left and far-right parties, but his pension reform concession ensured the Socialists would not back the measures.

Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images “Passing the budget will be harder than surviving a confidence vote,” Rabobank macro strategist Stefan Koopman said in a note, adding that further concessions would fail to resolve France’s deficit issues. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said his party would now fight to introduce its flagship Zucman wealth tax, aiming to raise revenue with higher taxes on France’s richest individuals. “In the forthcoming debate, we on the left will be working together to defend the Zucman tax and public services and to protect the poorest,” Faure wrote in a post on X. The tax, named after an idea put forward by French economist Gabriel Zucman, entails a 2% levy on wealth above €100m, affecting about 0.01% of taxpayers. Share Updated at 09.42 EDT Giorgos Sideris, head of the association of hospital doctors of Athens and Piraeus, has said salaries of healthcare staff in the Greek capital have been “frozen” amid a dispute with prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Associated Press (AP) reports. Riot police were seen scuffling with medical staff at the University general hospital Attikon when Mitsotakis was visiting a new oncology department and the refurbished emergency department. Health workers were protesting staff shortages, low pay and poor working conditions. Sideris said: They think we’re going to thank them because they owe us 10,000 days of leave. They think we’re going to thank them for keeping our salaries frozen. The head of the association, who is a doctor at the hospital, said 130 patients had recently been sleeping on stretchers in corridors due to overcrowding and that an extra 125 nursing staff were urgently needed “just to operate at safety level.” Riot police scuffled with medical staff at an Athens public hospital on Wednesday during a protest over the state of public health services held during a visit to the facility by prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Associated Press (AP) reports.

The hospital’s new oncology ward was built with funding from a charity organisation, and is expected to care for more than 20,000 patients per year, a 41% increase from 2019, the prime minister’s office said. Speaking during the inauguration, Mitsotakis said regular funding for Attikon had increased from €90m ($104.5m). Staffing levels had also increased, he said, “not to the level that we’d like, but we continue to insist on this great effort to comprehensively restructure the National Health System.” Foreign donors have provided 93.3 billion crowns ($4.5 billion) to a Czech-led initiative to find and deliver large-calibre ammunition to Ukraine , and the Czech Republic has contributed 1.7 billion crowns, defence minister Jana Cernochova said on Wednesday. Increased ammunition supplies in 2024 and 2025 have helped reduce Ukraine’s disadvantage compared with Russia on the frontline, although it is unclear whether the Czech action will continue under the next government. Prime minister Petr Fiala said at a news conference with Cernochova that the Czech Republic has arranged supplies of 3.7 million artillery rounds to Ukraine, including 1.3 million so far this year. Funding for the supplies has come from the initiative, as well as the yield on frozen Russian assets, bilateral cooperation and direct Ukrainian purchases, he said. Fiala said this year’s supplies should reach 1.8 million shells. The Nato military alliance has intensified its intelligence gathering activities near the borders of Russia and its ally Belarus , Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying on Wednesday. Germany has agreed to negotiate with Turkey over potential deliveries of Eurofighter jets, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said on Wednesday. “The German government has responded positively to a preliminary request from Airbus to negotiate the delivery of Eurofighters to Turkey,” the spokesperson said. “These aircraft are used for collective defence within the Nato framework.” He added that foreign minister Johann Wadephul will travel to Ankara on Friday to discuss the issue with his Turkish counterpart.

Officials told AFP that Brussels wants the project – now called the “European Drone Defence Initiative” – to begin initially working by the end of 2026, and to be fully functioning by the end of 2027. The Guardian was unable to independently verify AFP’s report. The initiative is one of several flagship EU projects set to be unveiled by the European Commission on Thursday in a roadmap aimed at preparing the bloc for a potential attack by Moscow by 2030.

Lawmakers from German chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right CDU/CSU have reacted furiously to defence minister Boris Pistorius’ stance on army recruitement being voluntary, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Senior CDU lawmaker Norbert Roettgen told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung: In 30 years in parliament, I have never seen a minister torpedo an important bill and plunge his own MPs into chaos like this. Nato targets call for Germany to build up its total military strength to 460,000 troops – made up of 260,000 active soldiers and 200,000 reservists. But the Bundeswehr is now a far cry from those figures, with around only 182,000 active soldiers and 49,000 reservists. Pistorius hopes to avoid the need for a draft lottery, which has been pushed by Merz, by attracting more volunteers with better pay and benefits like free driving licences and technical training opportunities. German defence minister Boris Pistorius hit back on Wednesday at critics within his own government as a row over army recruitment threatens to overshadow Berlin’s push to bolster its military deterrence, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Conservative chancellor Friedrich Merz, citing the threat of a hostile Russia, has tasked Pistorius of the centre-left Social Democrats with boosting recruitment to build up “the strongest conventional army in Europe”. But the question of how to get there has led to angry recriminations, as Pistorius prefers a purely voluntary approach and Merz’s CDU/CSU has advocated the potential use of a draft lottery if necessary. The coalition government had planned a first reading of a compromise draft law this week, but disagreement on the details sparked a row on Tuesday. Pistorius told reporters on Wednesday that the idea of a draft lottery was a “lazy compromise” and would be too time-consuming in practice.

Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 07.07 EDT Russian forces have added a key upgrade to their drone fleet since the summer, according to Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian military and drone expert whose team studies intercepted Russian drones, the Associated Press (AP) reports. Cameras and radio modems, which send and receive data wirelessly, have been fitted to various types of long-range strike drones. That allows operators to adjust a drone’s flight path in real time, sharply increasing precision compared to preprogrammed models. Beskrestnov said locomotives are particularly vulnerable to the new technology, because they are relatively slow and follow predictable routes. If the Russians keep hitting diesel and electric locomotives, the time will come very soon when the track will still be intact – but we’ll have nothing left to run on it. The modified drones can fly up to 200km into Ukrainian territory while streaming video back to operators in Russian-held areas, Beskrestnov said. An official at Ukraine’s defence ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity to AP, said Ukrainian forces also have recovered and examined a Geran-type drone fitted with a civilian camera and radio modem. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed.

Share Updated at 06.57 EDT Pjotr Sauer is a Russian affairs reporter for the Guardian When Vladimir Putin first announced he would host a “Russia-Arab world” summit, the Kremlin imagined the region’s leaders flying to Moscow to discuss regional security and energy relations, with the Russian leader presiding. Announced in April and prepared for months, the summit had been scheduled for Wednesday, intended as a showcase of Moscow’s enduring influence in the Middle East and proof it remains far from isolated despite western sanctions. But Putin was forced to shelve the gathering after only a handful of leaders, including Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and the head of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, confirmed their attendance. Instead, on Monday, global attention turned to Egypt, where world leaders gathered for a Gaza “peace summit” – with Russia notably absent. At Sharm el-Sheikh, Donald Trump joined Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in welcoming heads of states from across the Middle East and Europe as they signed a long-awaited Gaza treaty, with leaders jostling to be photographed beside the US president. While analysts say Moscow was never expected to play a major role in the Gaza peace process, its absence in Egypt underscored a reality the Kremlin is reluctant to admit: as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its influence in the Middle East – long touted as a counterweight to that of the west – is waning.

A scheme agreed by the governing parties over the summer under a plan laid out by the popular defence minister, Boris Pistorius of the Social Democrats (SPD), would have relied on voluntary recruitment to draw tens of thousands of young men to military service. But doubts among the chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc that that plan would be sufficient to top up troop levels led to insistent calls for a compulsory mechanism – a form of conscription – to kick in automatically if necessary. “We want to try to achieve this voluntarily with the SPD first,” said Merz, whose support has plunged amid coalition infighting, earlier this month. “I am sceptical. If we succeed, so much the better.” Merz pledged on taking office in May to create Europe’s strongest conventional army . Germany does not have its own nuclear arsenal. The dispute came to a head this week after Pistorius vetoed a compromise under which a contingent of young men selected by a lottery could have been pressed into mandatory Bundeswehr service if the volunteer programme failed to produce enough recruits. A news conference to announce the outlines of the new “conscription lite” draft bill, which was to have been introduced to the Bundestag lower house of parliament this week, was hastily cancelled late on Tuesday. The parties blamed each other. “In over 30 years as a member of the Bundestag, I have never seen a federal minister directly torpedo an important legislative process in his own area of responsibility and plunge his own parliamentary group into chaos,” Norbert Röttgen, a senior Christian Democrat, told the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. Pistorius fired back that he had long rejected key aspects of the CDU’s proposals, insisting in Berlin’s Tagesspiegel newspaper: “I don’t torpedo things, and I’m not destructive either.” A previous draft law from the summer had included a passage stipulating that the Bundestag could order young men called up only “if the defence policy situation makes a rapid expansion [of troop levels] imperative”. Conservatives found the language too vague and demanded a compulsory option in the law from the start. The parties have agreed on a first phase of all 18-year-old men filling out a mandatory questionnaire about their fitness and interest in military service. Including women in a conscription programme would require a constitutional amendment, which is not on the table at this time. Until 2011, men were obliged to perform some form of civic service upon turning 18, with those who did not want to serve in the army having the option to instead carry out Zivildienst in institutions such as hospitals or elderly care homes. The army downsized after the cold war and both services were eventually suspended under Angela Merkel, although a clause allowing the state to draft men remains part of the basic law. But since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, experts have expressed alarm at the state of the military , with dwindling numbers of recruits and severe equipment shortages. Critics say the conditions have created a vicious circle, making military service unattractive. In response to Nato assessments of the threat posed by Russia, Germany has pledged to gradually boost troop levels to 260,000 soldiers from 180,000 currently, in addition to 200,000 reservists. A poll this week found a majority of Germans – 54% – support a return to the conscription system , with support strongest among those over the age of 60. The inspector general of the armed forces, Carsten Breuer, has stressed the urgency of revising the recruitment process and voiced confidence that the original draft law could attract legions of new volunteers. “We need rapid growth potential to enable us to defend ourselves and also to deter attacks,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/germany-coalition-row-military-resources-boris-pistorius-social-democrats,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848e02a26c40ceb3f08439d0b196171fe5d582ec/659_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e8ab268393f605245465acfbee57f60",2025-10-15T14:19:38+00:00,ef5926fb2684cae849eb885681c6f3dfd37b4c22
39e6251f6588,"Driverless taxis from Waymo will be on London’s roads next year, US firm announces",,"People in London could be hiring driverless taxis from Waymo next year, after the US autonomous vehicle company announced plans to launch its services there. The UK capital will become the first European city to have an autonomous taxi service of the kind now familiar in San Francisco and four other US cities using Waymo’s technology. The launch pits an innovation sometimes dubbed the “robotaxi” against London’s famous black cabs, which can trace their history back to the first horse-drawn hackney coaches of the Tudor era. But a representative of the capital’s cab drivers said they were not concerned by the arrival of a “fairground ride” and questioned the reliability of driverless vehicles. Waymo said its cars were now on their way to London and would start driving on the capital’s streets in the coming weeks with “trained human specialists”, or safety drivers, behind the wheel. The company, originally formed as a spin-off from Google’s self-driving car programme, said it would scale up operations and work closely with Transport for London and the Department for Transportto obtain the permits needed to offer fully autonomous rides in 2026. Uber and the UK tech company Wayve have also announced their own plans to trial their driverless taxis in the capital next year, after the British government said it would accelerate rules allowing public trials to take place before legislation enabling self-driving vehicles passes in full. The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I’m delighted that Waymo intends to bring their services to London next year, under our proposed piloting scheme. “Boosting the AV [autonomous vehicle] sector will increase accessible transport options alongside bringing jobs, investment and opportunities to the UK. Cutting-edge investment like this will help us deliver our mission to be world leaders in new technology and spearhead national renewal.” A fuller rollout of self-driving taxis is expected in the UK after the Automated Vehicles Act fully takes effect in late 2027. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents black-cab drivers, known in the city as “cabbies”, said: “It’s a fairground ride. “It’s a tourist attraction in San Francisco. Quite frequently one of them will lock up in the middle of a junction because it gets confused and the police have to come and park, wait for the Waymo man to get his laptop out and get it going again.” He said London would pose a bigger challenge for Waymo, due to its irregular road system. He added that he did not believe there was public appetite for the technology. “If there was demand for it, Nigel Farage would be saying get rid of immigrants, have driverless cars instead. But there’s no demand for it.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Waymo, part of the Alphabet group that also owns Google, already has ties to Britain after opening its first European engineering hub in Oxford in 2019. It is also launching services in Tokyo using Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles, its only other current venture outside the US. Its co-chief executive Tekedra Mawakana said the technology was “making roads safer and transportation more accessible”, adding: “We’ve demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing, and we can’t wait to expand the benefits of our technology to the United Kingdom.” Waymo launched its autonomous taxis in 2020 and has amassed a fleet of more than 2,000 driverless vehicles. It says it has taken more than 10 million passengers in the US, offering services in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Atlanta. London would become the only European city in which the company is operational, pending approval from central government and Transport for London. Despite some alarming incidents , Waymo said the data showed that cars driven by humans were involved in incidents that injured pedestrians 12 times more often than its autonomous vehicles. Its cars use cameras, artificial intelligence, radar and lidar – sensors that use lasers to measure distance in three dimensions – to create a map of objects around the vehicle, including in darkness and weather conditions such as rain.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/15/driverless-taxis-from-waymo-will-be-on-londons-roads-next-year-us-firm-announces,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cf1bf49daa7e80b897635f58a11d3f6c90ed84/317_0_3252_2602/master/3252.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab88f967f2b71fac836bfdacb57451fd",2025-10-15T09:00:32+00:00,b884d81843e3430874f0f78ceb82c960b448b5af
377ae4069d4b,Gaza ceasefire live: Israel says body handed over by Hamas is not one of the hostages,,"Summary of the day so far It is 5pm in Gaza and Israel . Here is a summary of some of the key events reported on the blog so far today: The Israeli military said on Wednesday that one of the bodies handed over by Hamas the previous day as part of the ceasefire deal is not that of one of the hostages who was held in Gaza. Four bodies were handed over by Hamas on Tuesday to ease pressure on the fragile ceasefire, after the first four on Monday – when the last 20 living hostages were released. The families of former Gaza hostages Ouriel Baruch, Eitan Levy and Tamir Nimrodi, posted statements on social media after Israel’s forensic research laboratory confirmed the identities. Baruch was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Nimrodi, who had been serving with the Israeli defence body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza, was taken by militants from the Erez border crossing. Levy was kidnapped while driving a friend to kibbutz Be’eri during the Hamas attack. Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and Israel resumed preparations to open the main Rafah crossing after a dispute over the return of the bodies of dead hostages that had threatened to derail the ceasefire deal with Hamas. Cogat declined to comment on the number of trucks expected to enter Gaza on Wednesday. Israel had threatened to keep Rafah shut and reduce aid supplies because Hamas was returning bodies too slowly. Gaza humanitarian aid trucks wait to cross intro strip – video Israel’s far-right security minister called for a total halt on humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Speaking on Tuesday, Itamar Ben Gvir, who is a security minister despite having been convicted in 2007 of racist incitement and supporting groups on terrorism blacklists, said Hamas was “playing games”. Forensic authorities in Gaza have started the identification process of 45 bodies of Palestinians that Israel released on Tuesday as part of the ceasefire deal, according to the health ministry . Israel is expected to transfer more bodies, though the total number has not been announced. The Palestinian Centre for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons urged Israel on Tuesday to provide all available information on bodies returned to Gaza, including “names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths”. The centre said it received information that some of the bodies that were transferred on Tuesday were only partial remains, raising concerns about the circumstances of their death and detention The health ministry said the bodies of 19 people had been brought to hospitals in Gaza over the past 24 hours. They include 16 bodies that were recovered from under the rubble, the ministry said in its daily report. Hospitals also received 35 injured Palestinians. The ministry said it did not add the 45 bodies that Israel transferred to Gaza on Tuesday to its tally. The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip is expected to reopen to allow people to cross on Thursday with an EU mission expected to deploy there, two sources have told Reuters. According to the news agency, the sources did not specify what restrictions might be applied to those seeking to cross. The Israeli military and the office of the Israeli prime minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. Mohammad Shtayyeh, special envoy to president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas said an agreement with the EU border assistance mission (EUBam) to help the authority manage the Rafah crossing effectively, which was paused in March as hostilities recommenced, is still valid. “We don’t need a new agreement. The agreement is there, and I think now it’s in the final shape of putting all the bits and pieces together for it to function,” he told reporters in Geneva on a visit to Switzerland where he met Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis. The European Union said on Wednesday it is on standby to deploy EUBam at the Rafah border crossing in Gaza if conditions on the ground improve. Anouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the European Commission said the EUBam remains on standby to deploy to the Rafah crossing point “as soon as conditions allow.” He did not elaborate on those conditions. Under Gaza’s ceasefire deal, Israel freed dozens of doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical personnel seized during raids on hospitals. But more than 100 remain in Israeli prisons , including Dr Hossam Abu Safiya, a hospital director who became the face of the struggle to keep treating patients under Israeli siege and bombardment. Despite widespread calls for his release, Abu Safiya was not among the hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners freed on Monday in exchange for 20 hostages held by Hamas. Palestinian Authority representatives are touring Europe to try to convince countries that have not yet recognised a Palestinian state to get onboard, a presidential envoy said during a visit to Switzerland on Wednesday. Former Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, now serving as special envoy for president Mahmoud Abbas, told reporters that he had met Switzerland’s top diplomat to push Berne to join “the countries who recognise Palestine”. Israel’s siege on Gaza, which has killed one in every 33 locals , has also decimated infrastructure and ecosystems, according to a new report. The war in Gaza has left more than 300 water wells damaged or inaccessible while taking a major toll on the capacity of desalination plants. Sewage in Gaza constitutes another public health crisis, while Israeli troops have also damaged more than 80% of croplands in Gaza. Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in a Tel Aviv court on Wednesday for the latest hearing in his long-running corruption trial, which opened in May 2020. The prime minister kept a smiling face as he and his entourage of several ministers from his conservative Likud party were heckled by protesters en route to the tribunal. Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Four to five deceased hostages are expected to be returned to Israel from Gaza this evening , a source familiar with the matter has told CNN. Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all of the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours, though the group has indicated that locating some of the remains amid the rubble of Gaza will take longer. So far, seven of the remaining 28 deceased hostages have been returned (the number was eight but Israel has since said one of the bodies was not one of the hostages). Share Updated at 13.29 EDT Gaza needs massive boost in emergency aid after ceasefire, UN relief chief says The United Nations is seeking a dramatic boost in humanitarian aid for Gaza , saying the hundreds of relief trucks cleared to enter the devastated enclave under a ceasefire were nowhere near the thousands needed to ease a humanitarian disaster. Tom Fletcher, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and its top emergency relief coordinator, told Reuters in an interview that thousands of humanitarian vehicles must enter weekly to avert further catastrophe. “We have 190,000 metric tons of provisions on the borders waiting to go in and we’re determined to deliver. That’s essential life-saving food and nutrition,” Fletcher said. Israel’s two-year air and ground war against Palestinian militant group Hamas drove almost all Gaza’s 2.2 million people from their homes, and famine is present in the north, global monitors say.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Dozens of soldiers and civilians have been killed after fresh clashes broke out along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and Islamabad carried out retaliatory airstrikes on the Afghan capital, Kabul, and Kandahar province. The two sides declared a ceasefire by Wednesday night after the latest outbreak of violence, which came after the deadliest cross-border clashes in years over the weekend. Both countries accused the other of sparking the violence. Pakistan’s military said the Afghan Taliban had carried out “unprovoked fire” on major border posts close to the Kurram district and the crossing between the Chaman and Spin Boldak districts on Tuesday evening. It said it had retaliated with mortar fire and drone strikes, killing 20 Taliban fighters. Pakistani security sources confirmed that the air force had also carried out strikes on headquarters of Taliban forces in Kandahar province, where the cross-firing reportedly began, and on targets in Kabul. Images showed the “friendship gate” at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing had sustained significant damage in the attacks, and it remained closed for the day. Hundreds of people fled Pakistani border villages overnight and local residents reported cross-border firing, strikes and drone deployment that lasted into the evening. In Kandahar province, residents said many people along the border areas had also been fleeing. The Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, travelled to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with Vladimir Putin , marking their first meeting since the fall of the Kremlin ally Bashar al-Assad and his subsequent exile in Russia. The talks underscored Moscow’s efforts to safeguard its military foothold in Syria and forge relations with the new rulers in Damascus, with both sides taking a pragmatic approach despite having been enemies only a year ago. The meeting is notable given that Sharaa, a former jihadist, led the successful rebellion against the Moscow-backed Assad regime last year, in which his rebel forces briefly came under fire from Russian jets before Moscow withdrew its support for the Assad family. Speaking in the Kremlin, Sharaa said his government respected all previously signed agreements between Damascus and Moscow, indicating that Russia would be allowed to retain its military bases in Syria, though the exact scale of their presence remains unclear. Sharaa’s visit comes after Moscow was forced to postpone a long-planned summit with Arab leaders after a series of cancellations by regional heavyweights preoccupied with Gaza peace talks. In his remarks, Putin said Russia had “always based its relations with Syria on the interests of the Syrian people”, adding that the relationship “has always been exclusively friendly”. A top US military official in the Middle East has urged Hamas “to stop shooting Palestinian civilians”. This came after reports that the group’s fighters clashed with armed parties and killed alleged gangsters in what it described as an effort to restore law and order. “We strongly urge Hamas to immediately suspend violence and shooting innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza — in both Hamas-held parts of Gaza and those secured by the IDF behind the Yellow Line,” said Admiral Brad Cooper of the United States Central Command, referring to the initial ceasefire line dividing zones of control in Gaza. He used an acronym of the Israeli military. The call came a day after president Donald Trump said the clashes left him unbothered and did not affect the agreement that could pave the way for Hamas’ disarmament. The only border crossing between Gaza and Egypt is expected to open to allow hundreds of trucks carrying desperately needed aid into the devastated Palestinian territory. Aid agencies said on Wednesday they were hoping for an increase in humanitarian assistance, especially to the north of Gaza , to where more than 300,000 displaced people have returned in recent days. Thousands of tonnes of aid, including food and medical supplies, has been loaded on to trucks waiting in Egypt or stockpiled elsewhere in the region, humanitarian officials said. At least 400 trucks carrying aid were heading for Gaza , the Egyptian Red Crescent said on Wednesday afternoon, but it was unclear how long it would take for the convoys to complete border formalities and enter the territory.

The meeting underlines Russia’s desire to establish working ties with Syria’s new leadership and secure a military foothold in the country, reports the Associated Press (AP). Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday the future of the Russian bases in Syria was on the talks’ agenda. Syrian state news agency Sana reported that al-Sharaa and Putin will “discuss regional and international developments of mutual interest and explore ways to develop cooperation to serve the common interests of both countries”. According to the AP, Al-Sharaa did not mention the Russian bases in his brief televised remarks at the start of the meeting but emphasised the “long historic relationship” between the countries and their “common interests,” noting that Syria still partially depends on Russian production and expertise, particularly in the energy field. He said: We are trying to restore and define in a new way the nature of this relationship.

The meeting is notable given that Sharaa, a former jihadist, led the successful rebellion against the Moscow-backed Assad regime last year, in which his rebel forces briefly came under fire from Russian jets before Moscow withdrew its support for the Assad family. Speaking in the Kremlin, Sharaa said his government respected all previously signed agreements between Damascus and Moscow, indicating that Russia would be allowed to retain its military bases in Syria, though the exact scale of their presence remains unclear. Sharaa’s visit comes after Moscow was forced to postpone a long-planned summit with Arab leaders after a series of cancellations by regional heavyweights preoccupied with Gaza peace talks. In his remarks, Putin said Russia had “always based its relations with Syria on the interests of the Syrian people”, adding that the relationship “has always been exclusively friendly”. Russia’s 2015 military intervention in Syria’s civil war kept Assad’s brutal regime in power and came at great cost to the Syrian people. A 2020 UN investigation into atrocities committed in Syria accused Russia of direct involvement in war crimes for indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets such as medical facilities . Russia’s backing of Assad allowed it to expand its influence and establish several key military facilities in Syria. The fate of Russia’s two main military bases in Syria was thrown into doubt after Assad’s dramatic fall, and its presence there has since been sharply reduced. The sites hold an outsized importance to Russia: the Tartus facility gives Putin access to a warm water port, while Moscow has used the Khmeimim airbase as a staging post to fly its military contractors in and out of locations across Africa. After Assad’s demise, Russia withdrew several naval vessels from its Tartus base, dismantled air defence radars, and airlifted other military equipment and personnel . Syria’s new authorities have also cancelled an investment deal with Moscow over the management of Tartus in favour of DP World, the Dubai-based logistics company. Russia has continued to supply Syria with oil, grain and other vital resources at discount prices. Observers have compared Moscow’s flexible diplomacy in Syria to its approach to the Taliban. The group was designated as a terrorist organisation in 2003, but was later courted by the Kremlin after seizing power in Afghanistan in 2021. For Sharaa, the Moscow visit marks an effort to diversify his alliances and project a more moderate, state-building image. In recent months, he has held talks with Donald Trump, as well as several European and Gulf leaders, securing significant sanctions relief while maintaining close ties with Turkey, his main regional backer. Syria may also view Moscow as a counterweight to Israel, which has repeatedly bombed Syrian military facilities over the past year. During the visit to Moscow, Sharaa is expected to formally request Assad’s extradition for trial over crimes against Syrians, according to Reuters. Little is known about Assad’s life in exile since his chaotic exit from Syria aboard a Russian plane. The German Die Zeit outlet reported last week that the former president divides his time between a luxury Moscow flat and a secure country villa, spending much of his day playing video games. His wife, Asma, who was born in Britain, is reportedly undergoing treatment for leukaemia. Russia’s longtime foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that Assad and his family were granted asylum “for purely humanitarian reasons” after facing risks of repression at home. Lavrov added that Assad “faces no problems living in our capital” and dismissed rumours that the former leader had been hospitalised owing to poisoning. Analysts say Moscow is unlikely to extradite Assad, given its record as a haven for fugitives such as Ukraine’s ousted president Viktor Yanukovych and the former Wirecard executive turned FSB operative, Jan Marsalek.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/syrian-president-in-first-visit-to-moscow-as-former-enemies-hold-talks,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac1ca0bab478885b6e7b891a6972ec6f875e252/568_0_5115_4092/master/5115.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a99f213a4cdbb006a1fb502290c14292",2025-10-15T14:59:33+00:00,69527b8d94bbab8460795a672b06a709865de147
abf1ca8ae207,Israel urged to open more Gaza border crossings to allow surge of aid,,"Aid agencies and the United Nations are calling for Israel to open more crossings into Gaza to allow “thousands of trucks” to enter the devastated territory every day. Preparations are being made to allow convoys through the southern Rafah crossing with Egypt on Thursday, the first such access through the critical entry point since May last year. However, humanitarian officials are also calling for other entry points to be opened, including a crossing to northern Gaza , which would allow vital supplies to reach hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have travelled across the devastated territory in recent days to reach their shattered homes. Tom Fletcher, the UN’s most senior relief coordinator, called on Israel to facilitate the “massive surge of humanitarian aid – on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted.” “We need more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles. Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said. Aid agencies say thousands of tonnes of aid, including food and medical supplies, has been loaded on to trucks waiting in Egypt or stockpiled elsewhere in the region. “We have the supplies, the tools and the skills … We just need the access,” said one international aid worker, recently returned from Gaza. The fragile ceasefire in Gaza had faced its first test when Israel on Tuesday accused Hamas of failing to comply with the deal signed last week by delaying the return the bodies of hostages. In retaliation, Israel said it would cut the number of trucks it would allow into Gaza to 300, half the total agreed in the ceasefire deal, and postpone indefinitely the opening of the Rafah crossing. Hours later, Hamas handed over the remains of three more hostages to the Red Cross, bringing to eight the number of bodies transferred since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold, and leaving 21 to be accounted for. Vehicles transporting the bodies of four hostages arrive at the national forensic medicine centre in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty The militant Islamist organisation said the delays were due to difficulties locating burial sites amid the swaths of rubble left by the two-year conflict. A fourth body transferred by Hamas was found not to be that of a hostage. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that heavy equipment needed for repairing damaged infrastructure would be permitted to enter Gaza and Palestinians who had left the territory during the war would be allowed back for the first time. Others would be allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing, subject to Israel’s security approval. Palestinians awaiting medical evacuation said they had not yet received notification from the World Health Organization to prepare for travel.

Israel has repeatedly blocked aid from entering Gaza during the conflict, prompting accusations it has used starvation as a weapon of war . A famine was declared in parts of the territory in August. The EU said on Wednesday it was on standby to deploy a longstanding humanitarian mission, known as a EUBam (EU Border Assistance Missions), at the Rafah crossing if conditions on the ground improved. Humanitarian officials in Gaza City said on Wednesday assistance was desperately needed, with hundreds of thousands of people without clean water, food and other essentials and many more suffering greatly. Though aid was supposed to start flowing over the weekend, on Monday crossings from Israel were closed to allow the hostage transfer and Palestinian prisoners to reach Gaza and then for national holidays. Palestinians collect water from a broken pipe in Gaza City on 12 October. Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/AP Tess Ingram of Unicef, speaking from southern Gaza, said: “We had heard that Sunday would be the first day of a big scale-up of aid coming in but what we’ve seen so far is in very sharp contrast to how high and desperate the needs are. “People are not sure when they are next going to get any water. There is not enough food. We had 45 outpatient nutrition clinics open in August, now there are just seven.” Trump’s proposed plan calls for “full aid” to enter Gaza. Later phases of the plan call for Hamas to disarm and give up all power, which it has so far refused to do, instead launching a security crackdown to reassert its authority in Gaza through public executions and clashes with local clans. Longer-term elements include how Gaza will be governed and the makeup of an international stabilisation force but are yet to be fully discussed. map On Monday, Israelis celebrated the return of the last 20 living hostages in Gaza and Palestinians rejoiced at Israel’s release of about 2,000 prisoners and detainees as part of the ceasefire’s first phase. Negotiations are under way on a second phase, which will have to resolve multiple thorny issues. In a demonstration of the political challenges facing the truce, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister and an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace”. “Nazi terrorism understands only force and the only way to solve problems with it is to wipe it off the face of the earth,” he added, accusing Hamas of lies and abuse over the return of hostages’ bodies. The Hostages Family Forum, a group representing many of the hostages’ families, said the three dead hostages whose remains were identified on Tuesday night were Uriel Baruch, Tamir Nimrodi and Eitan Levi.

The forum said Levi was abducted while driving a friend to a kibbutz during the Hamas attack.

Meanwhile a hospital in Gaza said the 45 anonymous remains of Palestinians they had received in return arrived with cuffs on their legs and arms. The latest handover of dead hostages held in Gaza on Tuesday night came after the Israeli government threatened to halve the expected flow of aid into the strip. Grieving Israeli families were angered after only four of the missing 28 deceased hostages were released on Monday, when the 20 Israelis still alive in Gaza came home .

Photograph: Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty The Israeli military said on Wednesday that one of the bodies handed over by Hamas “does not match any of the hostages”, after examinations at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. “Hamas is required to make all necessary efforts to return the deceased hostages,” it said. The ceasefire agreement requires Hamas to make every effort to return the missing bodies in exchange for those of 360 Palestinians killed in the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, officials at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis in southern Gaza said none of the 45 bodies they had received from Israel had been identified and that they had arrived at the facility with their hands and legs cuffed. “Some are blindfolded and there are signs of gunshot wounds in some cases, while others have been run over by tanks,” the hospital told CNN . The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons called on Israel to provide all available information on the bodies being handed over “including the names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths”. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s security minister, said Hamas was ‘playing games’ and called on Benjamin Netanyahu to issue ‘a clear ultimatum’. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Reuters Speaking on Tuesday, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right security minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, despite having been convicted in 2007 of racist incitement and supporting groups on terrorism blacklists, said Hamas was “playing games” over the dead hostages. He said: “Enough with the disgrace. Moments after opening the crossings to hundreds of trucks, Hamas very quickly returned to its known methods – to lie, to cheat and to abuse families and the bodies. This Nazi terror understands only force and the only way to deal with it is to erase it from the face of the earth.” Ben Gvir called on Netanyahu to issue “a clear ultimatum to Hamas: if you do not immediately return all the bodies of our fallen and you continue with these delays, we will immediately halt all aid supplies entering the [Gaza] Strip”. Israel has repeatedly blocked aid from entering Gaza during the conflict, prompting accusations it has used starvation as a weapon of war . Humanitarian officials have repeatedly warned that assistance is desperately needed. Famine was declared in parts of Gaza in August.

The body of Baruch, a father of two from Jerusalem, was taken from the Nova music festival, where he was shot dead near his car during the Hamas attack. Levy, a taxi driver, was killed after dropping off a friend at the Be’eri kibbutz on the morning of the attack and his remains were taken into Gaza the same day. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel has freed some doctors, nurses and paramedics seized during raids on hospitals in Gaza, but other high-profile medical figures remain missing. According to the NGO Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), more than 100 remain in Israeli prisons, including Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, a hospital director, who became the face of the struggle to keep treating patients under Israeli siege and bombardment. Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, has been imprisoned without charge by Israel for nearly 10 months. HWW, which documents detentions from Gaza, said 55 medical workers – including 31 doctors and nurses – were on lists of freed detainees. The group said at least 115 medical workers remained in custody, as well as the remains of four who died while in Israeli prisons, where rights groups and witnesses have reported frequent abuse.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/bodies-released-hamas-one-not-hostage-israel-says,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee9e55fea14f5fa5eaebb273ef0942047d12b2d/458_0_5840_4672/master/5840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7627f157c9ade2cdc68a2f0dfeefdd7",2025-10-15T13:39:01+00:00,a2f61a43513a0236174687aefe86ac894e2ac2f7
9f6ace545b98,Putin’s embarrassing cancellation of Arab summit signals waning influence in Middle East,,"When Vladimir Putin first announced he would host a “Russia-Arab world” summit, the Kremlin imagined the region’s leaders flying to Moscow to discuss regional security and energy relations, with the Russian leader presiding. Announced in April and prepared for months, the summit had been scheduled for Wednesday, intended as a showcase of Moscow’s enduring influence in the Middle East and proof it remains far from isolated despite western sanctions. But Putin was forced to shelve the gathering after only a handful of leaders, including Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and the head of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, confirmed their attendance. Instead, on Monday, global attention turned to Egypt, where world leaders gathered for a Gaza “peace summit” – with Russia notably absent. At Sharm el-Sheikh, Donald Trump joined Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in welcoming heads of states from across the Middle East and Europe as they signed a long-awaited Gaza treaty, with leaders jostling to be photographed beside the US president. While analysts say Moscow was never expected to play a major role in the Gaza peace process, its absence in Egypt underscored a reality the Kremlin is reluctant to admit: as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its influence in the Middle East – long touted as a counterweight to that of the west – is waning. “Russia’s diplomatic role in the Middle East has declined as a result of the Ukraine war,” said Hanna Notte, a Berlin-based expert on Russian foreign policy. “When it comes to all the big developments, the major players in the region don’t look towards Moscow any more.” The summit in Egypt also highlighted a shift in the region, where many leaders are now focused on strengthening relations with Trump as Washington’s frustration grows over Putin’s refusal to end the war in Ukraine. For nearly a decade, the Middle East served as the stage for Putin’s long-sought return to global prominence. Russia’s 2015 military intervention in Syria’s civil war saved Bashar al-Assad’s regime from collapse, secured permanent naval and airbases on the Mediterranean, and revived Moscow’s image as a power capable of projecting force far beyond its borders. With its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was forced to divert much of its military, economic and diplomatic capacity, leaving it unable to prop up Assad as his regime crumbled. It has also watched its other key ally, Iran, see parts of its military and economic infrastructure repeatedly battered by Israeli strikes. Despite years of cultivating ties with the Palestinian Authority and hosting Hamas delegations for talks in Moscow, Russia played no tangible role in the negotiations that produced the Gaza ceasefire. By largely siding with the Palestinians and moving closer to Iran, Putin has strained his once warm relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last month that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile system to Kyiv. In public Russia’s elites have praised Trump’s efforts to end the war in Gaza, part of a broader charm offensive aimed at currying favour with the US leader. Putin said last Friday that he had offered to postpone his own Russia-Arab world summit “so as not to interfere” with Trump’s initiative, and lauded the US-led push to end the war in Gaza. “If Trump succeeds in accomplishing everything he set out to do, it would be a truly historic event,” he told reporters during a visit to Tajikistan. Still, frustration has seeped through among senior Russian officials at being sidelined. The veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that while Russia “would not refuse to take part in Middle East settlement efforts if invited”, the Kremlin was not going to “impose its services”. There was also open criticism of Trump’s deal. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former president and now deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, dismissed it as meaningless. “Releasing Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners is a good thing, of course, but it will not solve anything,” he said. “Until a full-fledged Palestinian state is established in line with the well-known UN resolutions, nothing will change. The war will continue. Everyone understands this.” Russia’s retreat from global influence reaches beyond the Middle East. Across Central Asia and the Caucasus, states once seen as loyal satellites – including Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan – are steadily drifting out of Moscow’s orbit, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced them to reassess the potential risks to their own security. In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House after mediating a peace deal between them. The agreement granted Washington exclusive rights to develop the so-called Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a corridor cutting through Armenia to link Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave on the Turkish border. Tellingly, both the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, and Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, travelled to Egypt on Monday. Putin will have another opportunity to host leaders from the Arab world, with the Kremlin indicating that the summit is likely to be rescheduled for November. “A summit serves to reinforces Russia’s message that it is not isolated outside the west,” said Notte. “It matters symbolically for Moscow, but it doesn’t restore Russia’s role as a major player in the region.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/putins-cancelled-russia-arab-summit-signals-waning-influence-in-middle-east,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0163f7a90ac7525e48f66d82836c2f26ceed3d0d/1126_0_4843_3874/master/4843.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1a5d5bd5f7816fc6d24cb1e7b167e9a",2025-10-15T08:16:31+00:00,b01b39de5187c47d718a38534caa05e0af042095
93379530adad,Dozens killed in fresh clashes along Afghanistan-Pakistan border,,"Dozens of soldiers and civilians have been killed after fresh clashes broke out along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and Islamabad carried out retaliatory airstrikes on the Afghan capital, Kabul, and Kandahar province. The two sides declared a ceasefire by Wednesday night after the latest outbreak of violence, which came after the deadliest cross-border clashes in years over the weekend. Both countries accused the other of sparking the violence. Pakistan’s military said the Afghan Taliban had carried out “unprovoked fire” on major border posts close to the Kurram district and the crossing between the Chaman and Spin Boldak districts on Tuesday evening. It said it had retaliated with mortar fire and drone strikes, killing 20 Taliban fighters. Pakistani security sources confirmed that the air force had also carried out strikes on headquarters of Taliban forces in Kandahar province, where the cross-firing reportedly began, and on targets in Kabul.

Photograph: Reuters Images showed the “friendship gate” at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing had sustained significant damage in the attacks, and it remained closed for the day. Hundreds of people fled Pakistani border villages overnight and local residents reported cross-border firing, strikes and drone deployment that lasted into the evening. In Kandahar province, residents said many people along the border areas had also been fleeing. The Afghan Taliban claimed Pakistan had “once again” launched the attacks, killing more than a dozen civilians, and they said they had killed several Pakistani soldiers and seized several border posts. Pakistan rebuffed the claim as “outrageous and blatant lies”. The heaviest casualties on Pakistan’s side were reported around the city of Chaman, which is just a few miles from the border and bore the brunt of heavy shelling from the Afghan side. Naqeeb Ullah, a resident in Chaman living just over a mile from the border, said the sky had been lit up with shelling and gunfire until the morning. “The sounds were so loud that it felt like it was happening in front of our house; all our doors and windows were shaking from the impact,” he said. Ullah said heavy firing had destroyed a local school close to the border and that he knew of several civilian fatalities. “I know a family of two or three people who were killed in attacks and a 11-year-old was badly injured in the attack,” he said. People fled their homes in Pakistani border villages last night, with many waiting for transportation in Chaman on Wednesday. Photograph: H Achakzai/AP The resumption of the deadly clashes and airstrikes has pushed the two once-amicable neighbours the closest to conflict with each other in years and has sparked fears of wider regional instability. Pakistan has maintained a longstanding relationship with the Afghan Taliban, sheltering many of the Islamist militant group’s leaders after the US invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan was among those backing the Taliban when they retook power in 2021. However, ties between the two have severely deteriorated as Islamabad has accused Kabul of giving sanctuary to the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP has been behind a rising number of deadly attacks in Pakistan in recent years. Pakistan has accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering TTP leadership and ignoring TTP training camps in Afghanistan, as well as giving finance and arms to the group, a claim Kabul denies.

Photograph: Sanaullah Seiam/AFP/Getty Images Last week, Pakistan was accused of carrying out two strikes on Afghan soil, including in Kabul, which were believed to be targeting TTP camps and leadership. Pakistan has neither denied or confirmed it was behind the strikes. In response, Taliban forces retaliated over the weekend with extensive firing at Pakistani troops stationed at border posts, prompting a heavy-handed response from Pakistan. Dozens of casualties were reported on both sides. The violence flared up again on Tuesday night, starting in Kurram district, when the Afghan Taliban were accused of cross-border shelling. Javed Ali, a nearby resident, said: “The firings and border clashes erupted at 8pm and kept ongoing from both sides for around two to three hours. We stayed inside our houses as it was terrifying.” Taliban security personnel on a Soviet-era tank are followed by motorcyclists as they ride towards the border on Wednesday.

He said those living in villages close to the border had evacuated. “Villages on the Pakistani side were hit by mortar shells and heavy firing. Hundreds of families have left the villages. We are trying to help people to vacate and shift to safer places,” he said. “Since the 2021 Taliban captured power, we have not witnessed such heavy border clashes.” By Wednesday night, both sides had agreed to a temporary 48-hour ceasefire, effective from 6pm. A statement by the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said both sides would engage in dialogue to find “a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/dozens-killed-afghanistan-pakistan-border-taliban-kurram-chaman-spin-boldak-kandahar-kabul,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4eae2a8a651d60dcc052951255ed58bc6a5908/245_0_2755_2204/master/2755.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05f7781a27418133577e25d9c2604053",2025-10-15T14:51:09+00:00,9f17ced87bfa52600f0fded26d22a3bf7853e6d7
5b114a904ead,‘Your basis to live is checked at each and every step’: India’s ID system divides opinion,,"I t is often difficult for people in India to remember life before Aadhaar. The digital biometric ID, allegedly available for every Indian citizen, was only introduced 15 years ago but its presence in daily life is ubiquitous. Indians now need an Aadhaar number to buy a house, get a job, open a bank account, pay their tax, receive benefits, buy a car, get a sim card, book priority train tickets and admit children into school. Babies can be given Aadhaar numbers almost immediately after they are born. While it is not mandatory, not having Aadhaar de facto means the state does not recognise you exist, digital rights activists say. For Umesh Patel, 47, a textile business owner in the city of Ahmedabad, Aadhaar has brought nothing but relief. He recalls the old days of bringing reams of paper to every official office, just to prove his ID – and confusion often still reigned. Now he simply flashes his Aadhaar and “everything is streamlined”, he said, describing it as a “marker of how our country is using technology for the benefit of its citizens”. “It’s a robust system that has made life much easier,” said Patel. “It is also good for the security of our country since it reduces the chances of anyone making fake documents. “Aadhaar is now part of the Indian identity.” The scheme has been deemed such a success that it was among those studied by the UK government as it looks to introduce mandatory ID cards for all citizens . Yet digital rights groups, activists and humanitarian groups paint a less rosy picture of Aadhaar and its implications for Indian society. For some of the poorest and least educated in India – whose lack of literacy, education or documents have left them unable to get an Aadhaar – the scheme has been highly exclusionary and therefore punitive, depriving some of those who need it most from being able to receive welfare or work. And as there is a growing push to have Aadhaar linked to voting rights and proof of citizenship, there are fears it will become a tool to further disenfranchise and demonise the poor. Apar Gupta, the founder and director of the Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation, said that, for many in India, Aadhaar had turned into a form of “digital coercion, in which each and every time they need to avail a government service, enter a public space or just conduct their lives, there is a constant demand for Aadhaar-based authentication”. Gupta said that since its introduction Aadhaar had “metastasised” and become the basis of an ever-expanding bureaucratic minefield of unique IDs required in order for people to conduct business. “Your very basis to live is checked at each and every step,” he said. Critics allege that India’s most recent data protection and privacy law, which remains in draft form, is not fit for purpose in protecting the privacy and possible misuse of the highly valuable and sensitive Aadhaar database, which includes biometrics such as photos, face scans, iris scans and fingerprints of more than 1 billion Indians. Over the years, the Indian media have uncovered numerous breaches of Aadhaar data, including an incident in 2018 when it was discovered that the details of 1.1 billion Indians on the Aadhaar database were being sold online for as little as 500 rupees (£5) . Keir Starmer met Narendra Modi in Mumbai last week. During his visit, Starmer praised the Aardhaar system as a ‘massive success’. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images “Under this law, which has still yet to be notified, there is no way to know if there has been a reported data breach and no oversight into how Aadhaar data may be bundled with other databases, which could enrich wider tracking and surveillance of citizens,” said Gupta. “There’s a complete lack of transparency.” While Aadhaar was introduced before the prime minister, Narendra Modi, came to power in 2014, his ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has embraced and expanded the unique digital ID scheme with gusto. As India hosted the G20 summit in 2023, Modi cited Aadhaar as one of the key successes of a “digital India” that had become an “incubator of innovation”. He has claimed that it has saved India more than $22bn in wiping out corruption in welfare schemes. The government has also pointed to Aadhaar’s vast adoption as a measure of its success and universality. More than 1.42bn Aadhaar numbers have been generated as of last month – almost the exact size of the population of India itself – making it the world’s largest digital identity scheme by a long mile. Before the scheme, more than 400 million Indians lacked any form of official ID and did not have access to a bank account. Yet, according to Chakradhar Buddha, a senior researcher at LibTech India, an organisation that has been assisting those left behind by India’s digital push, the reality on the ground – particularly in rural and tribal communities – was very different to that being painted by the government in Delhi. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ultimately, it’s a system that undermines access to essential social security and welfare for those that need it most.” The government’s insistence that Aadhaar is a watertight identity verification was questioned by Buddha, who said he had seen many examples of officials recording inaccurate names or details, creating greater problems for communities. In one village, where a tribal community did not have birth certificates, they were all given 1 January as their birthday. Tribal names are also regularly spelt wrong on Aadhaar cards as officials are unfamiliar with them. Buddha warned that using Aadhaar as a universal basis for voting rights would lead to a “mass expulsion of the poorest from the electoral register”, citing a recent example where millions of India’s poorest workers were wrongly deleted from a government system, depriving them of a livelihood, after an Aadhaar verification system was enforced. “These people are already deprived of social equality; now they want to use Aadhaar to strip away their right to political equality and universal franchise,” said Buddha. Among those who recently came up against the perils of being without an Aadhaar card was Aalam Sheikh, 34, an illiterate labourer, whose bag containing important ID documents and Aadhaar card was stolen on a train. What followed was a Kafkaesque nightmare. Not knowing his Aadhaar number, which he was given a decade ago, he had no way to get a new card. Without it, he was stopped from working his construction job, depriving his family of a vital income, and his son was later forced to withdraw from school. Months later, Sheikh has still been unable to resolve the problem and get a new card, even after travelling thousands of miles back to his village. Meanwhile, he lives in fear of being declared an illegal citizen without it. “This Aadhaar has become a nightmare for us. Why can’t the government maintain a proper system?” said Sheikh. “Everything in this country works against the poor, and so does this Aadhaar card.” Aakash Hassan contributed reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/india-id-system-divide-opinion,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a61baa70fbaba34c9d7eace6350b9e04c49f33f1/375_0_2883_2306/master/2883.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=35f412811983db1d8da021e73718f516",2025-10-14T05:00:12+00:00,7384eb05c2dfae96457713bbb149b42538727543
9b357860186b,Heavy clashes erupt along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,,"Intense clashes erupted along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Saturday night, after an attack by the Afghan Taliban on Pakistani military posts led to a heavy exchange of fire and reportedly left dozens of soldiers dead. According to officials, Afghan troops opened fire on Pakistani army posts along the north-western border with Pakistan on Saturday night and seized several of the posts. The attacks came after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes on Afghan territory, including in the capital, Kabul, earlier this week. On Sunday, Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes, gunfire and ground raids on Afghan Taliban posts along the border. In a statement, the media wing of the Pakistan military said 23 soldiers had been killed and another 29 wounded in the attacks. They claimed that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” from the Afghan side were killed in their retaliatory strikes and that terrorist training camps had been dismantled. The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier claimed that Taliban forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in the attacks, while just nine from the Taliban side were killed. Taliban security personnel patrol in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, Afghanistan. Photograph: Qudratullah Razwan/EPA The clashes signal a new low in Afghan-Pakistan relations, which have become increasingly hostile amid claims that Afghanistan is giving a safe haven to Islamist militants carrying out an escalating number of deadly attacks on Pakistani soil. Early on Sunday morning, the Taliban government’s defence ministry said its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border. “If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response,” said the ministry. Pakistan’s media wing accused the Afghan Taliban of launching attacks to “facilitate terrorism”. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement. “We will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” The cross-border strikes came after two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in south-eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks. Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of retribution operations”. Analysts said recent days showed just how volatile the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border had become. The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is contested by Afghanistan. Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Pakistan government has accused them of giving shelter to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamist militant group who are behind a deadly rise in insurgent attacks in Pakistan’s border region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Map Thousands of TTP militant attacks – mostly targeting Pakistani police, paramilitary and army – have been carried out over the past four years, leaving more than 2,500 dead. Islamabad has grown increasingly impatient with Kabul, publicly calling on the Afghan Taliban to stop harbouring TTP militants, accusing them of turning a blind eye to training camps and giving funding and arms to TTP fighters who carry out attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations backed by UN findings. Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said “Pakistan’s patience with Kabul had been wearing thin” as TTP attacks continued to escalate. Just earlier this week, at least three senior army officers, including 20 soldiers, were killed in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. According to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, there have been more than 600 attacks by TTP so far this year, the most in a decade. Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.” Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, where he was on an official visit to India this week, the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, denied that Afghanistan was giving shelter to TTP fighters. “There is no safe haven for TTP in Afghanistan,” he said. Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had reached out to “express that the war should stop”. “Afghanistan has the right to keep its territory and its borders safe and so it has retaliated to the violation,” he said. “We achieved the objective of our retaliatory mission … so from our end, we have stopped.” Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, described the border situation as “precarious”. He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan. “The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman. “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78cb4d8d819810970aaa4e9b2860e65e72bb2f2/0_0_5030_4024/master/5030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9abb5ed8bad2d354a16a97ed19e29b3",2025-10-12T12:29:38+00:00,ce2ba806c35f69886179dc08eb4a628c39bf78d3
d55518e9ad37,Unease at slow pace of change in Nepal one month on from gen Z protests,,"P rakash Bohora was one of the first of Nepal’s gen Z protesters to feel the sting of a police bullet. Like thousands of other young people, he had taken to the streets of the capital last month to protest against corruption and a draconian ban on social media. He had no idea that day in Kathmandu would escalate into what is now described as Nepal’s gen Z revolution, which saw the toppling of the government within a day, the dissolution of parliament and appointment of a new interim prime minister, the anti-corruption hardliner Sushila Karki, by the end of the week. Bohora was outside the parliament building in Kathmandu on the morning of 8 September when he heard the sound of gunfire and felt pain in his left leg. As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied trainer was left behind amid the pandemonium. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an evocative symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed.

Photograph: Prabin Ranabhat/AFP/Getty Images One month on, Bohora is still in hospital as doctors fight to save his leg. Sitting in the trauma ward, he expressed frustration at the what he saw as the slow pace of change for Nepal since the gen Z uprising, for which he paid such a heavy price. He was among those calling for the former prime minister KP Sharma Oli and the former home minister Ramesh Lekhak to be arrested for alleged corruption and their role in the shooting of protesters by police on 8 September. “It’s been a month since the movement began, yet many of our demands remain unmet,” Bohora said. Bohora had had been driven to protest in anger at a system that seemed to be making the politicians and their children wildly rich while he had faced unemployment and exploitation. Despite qualifying as a health assistant eight years ago, there was no work for Bohora in Nepal’s struggling job market and he eventually travelled to Russia for further studies. But after running out of money, he found himself coerced into joining the Russian army , fighting on the frontlines in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He saw friends killed and maimed. He finally escaped back to Nepal 18 months later. “I was lucky to return home alive,” Bohora said. “After coming back, I took to the streets hoping for a better country, free from corruption.” Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they simply wanted to raise their voice against corruption and never intended to bring about wholesale regime change – let alone be tasked with deciding the next prime minister and future of the country. Their movement had no single leader , no manifesto and no singular set of demands, and still largely remains that way. Even the decision to champion Karki, a former chief justice, as their choice of interim prime minister came after she emerged as a favourite in online discussions and polls held by thousands of gen Z protesters on the social media platform Discord. Nepal’s new interim prime minister, Sushila Karki, is an anti-corruption hardliner. The legitimacy of her government has been questioned by the country’s biggest political parties. Photograph: Monika Malla/Reuters With elections promised for March, Karki is under mounting pressure from gen Z groups to demonstrate that she will crack down on corruption as promised. Yet major bureaucratic obstacles remain in implementing large-scale reform, and the lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing bone of contention. “Right now, our main demand is to control corruption,” said Amit Khanal, 24, of the Gen-Z Movement Alliance. While there are no gen Z figures appointed to Karki’s cabinet yet, Khanal said they remained in close talks with the government. “This government was formed under special circumstances, and it must investigate the major corruption scandals, especially those involving former top leaders,” he said. “If no investigation is carried out, the entire purpose of this massive movement will be meaningless.” Om Prakash Aryal, whom Karki appointed as home minister, said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the obstructions and disconnect the political links” that had prevented the most powerful political figures from being investigated for corruption. “The environment is being created so the commission can accept complaints about anyone and investigate,” Aryal said. He emphasised that it would take time for authorities to carry out a full independent investigation into the decades of alleged graft, but added: “At the same time, there are things that must be acted on immediately. The government will not let impunity have room.” In the backdrop are growing efforts by Nepal’s biggest political parties – Nepali Congress, the Communists and the Maoists – to question the legitimacy of Karki’s interim government. After parliament was dissolved, all three parties released statements calling the move unconstitutional and dangerous. In a notable break from tradition, none attended Karki’s swearing-in ceremony. In an inflammatory speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of ulterior motives. “There is an attack on this country,” he said. “There is an attack on the sovereign power of this country. There is an attack on its territory. There is an attack on the country’s interests.” Analysts warned that the gulf between the interim government and the political parties could spell bad news for Nepal’s political stability and the success of its elections in March. Lok Raj Baral, a professor of political science and former ambassador to India, said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political old guard. “This is an opportunity for old parties to correct themselves, to transfer leadership, to renew and regain their credibility,” he said. “The old leaders were busy fighting for their chairs. They should have now learned their lesson.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

85fc1de188b5,Keir Starmer to look at India’s digital ID system during visit to Mumbai,,"Keir Starmer is to examine India’s digital ID system on his visit to Mumbai as a potential model for the UK, praising the system as a “massive success”. Speaking on his two-day trip to Mumbai, where he met an expert on India’s digital ID system, Starmer defended the introduction of a similar measure in the UK, saying he believed the rollout of a voluntary system could be expanded to school applications, mortgages and driving licences. Starmer met Nandan Nilekani, the non-exec chair of the tech company Infosys, to discuss the speed of the rollout in India and the transformation of the benefits system, which has cut bureaucracy – but also caused significant contention over the exclusion of some minorities. India’s version of the scheme – Aadhaar – has been introduced over the past 15 years to almost all of its 1.4bn citizens. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was not about a potential commercial arrangement with Infosys, adding that the government aimed to build its own version of the scheme in the public sector. But his interest in the Indian scheme will be taken as another sign that the government hopes the ID scheme will be part of the UK benefits system in time. Speaking to reporters en route to Mumbai, Starmer said he hoped digital IDs, which have plummeted in popularity since his announcement, would regain public confidence because of the convenience they could provide. “I don’t know how many times the rest of you have had to look in the bottom drawer for three bills when you want to get your kids into school or apply for this or apply for that, drives me to frustration,” he said. “I do think that we could gain a significant advantage. We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.” Keir Starmer speaks to the British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron, and the British deputy high commissioner for western India, Harjinder Kang, in Mumbai. Photograph: Leon Neal/Reuters The digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day. It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs. Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life. Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID. Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”. Protesters gather near Downing Street to voice their opposition to the plans for digital IDs. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Asked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said. Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work. “We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important. “There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.” The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech company Palantir saying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate. All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches. Net support for digital ID cards fell from 35% in the early summer to -14% at the weekend after Starmer’s announcement, according to polling by More in Common. The prime minister meets the Bollywood star Rani Mukerji during a visit to Yash Raj Films studio. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Starmer will meet his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi , on Thursday and make a keynote address at a fintech conference. The prime minister told a business delegation of more than 120 chief executives and cultural leaders that he hoped each one of them would have a deal to sign by the end of the trip. On a visit to a Bollywood production studio, Starmer announced three new Bollywood blockbusters would be made in the UK from next year by Yash Raj Films, creating more than 3,000 jobs. No 10 said deals signed during the trip would create about 7,000 jobs through Indian investment in the UK. Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules. “None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/keir-starmer-india-digital-id-visit-mumbai,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116950a317872360e58643c4079af16071a2c7d7/926_522_3453_2763/master/3453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9733965b9667ddda6a3170edf2ede5d0",2025-10-08T21:00:05+00:00,eaf49319adec7cea55c01b0de9a7a2c8f45a27ec
fff083c08c99,Competition regulator barking up the right tree on vets’ opaque pricing,,"P oor Tiddles and Fido are too often getting a bad deal – or, rather, their owners are – from the large corporates that dominate the veterinary business these days. That, very roughly, is the conclusion of the Competition and Markets Authority , which was obviously barking up the right tree when it decided 18 months ago to look at a sector that can take an opaque approach to pricing its goods and services. Prices have been rising far faster than general inflation between 2016 and 2023, says the watchdog . The increases cannot be justified – at least, nothing like fully – by investment in better kit or superior services or higher salaries. And, critically, there is a big difference between the prices charged by the large chains and the independents that, pre-2013, used to represent the bulk of the industry. The CMA found that the average price charged by a practice owned by a large vet group for consultation, treatment and medicines was 16.6% higher than at an independent vet. That statistic contributes, says the CMA, to a “customer detriment” – which can be regarded as excess profits – of more than £1bn over five years. “For a substantial part of the market as a whole, profits are much higher than they should be if competition was working well,” says the watchdog. So smash up the big chains? Try to reverse the consolidation of the past decade that has resulted in six companies – IVC Evidensia, VetPartners and Medivet (all private equity-backed), CVS and Pets at Home (both listed firms) and Linnaeus (owned by Mars, which is big in pet food as well as chocolate) – owning more than 60% of practices? Set a limit on local concentration? Well, no, the CMA is suggesting nothing so radical. It will be accused of being a watchdog with more bark than bite but, actually, it is probably right to reject significant “structural” remedies. The problem here is not one of lack of choice for consumers: a 60% combined share among six firms is not unusual in a consumer-facing market (just look at the supermarket trade). Rather, it is that the customers don’t really know what they’re getting, or how they could help themselves by shopping around. Forcing vet practices to display a price list is a basic improvement – it is amazing they’ve got away without that requirement for so long. Disclosure of corporate ownership also matters now the cat is out of the bag, as it were, on price differences. But the single biggest reform is a price cap of £16 for writing a prescription. Since it is probably impossible to try to set prices for thousands of medicines themselves, the easily implemented alternative is a flat fee for a prescription that can be used to shop at an online pharmacy; for repeat prescriptions, that ought to be effective in principle. It will all require the customers to do some leg work, of course, if the intensity of competition is to improve. But addressing the asymmetry in information between practices and customers is a useful place to start. The big operators, who had been making veiled threats about cutting investment if the CMA got too heavy, should count their blessings. There is nothing in this report that demands they do anything exceptional: they just have to provide levels of transparency that would be normal in most consumer sectors. The other half of the package is an overhaul of a regulatory system that is out of the 1960s and seems barely to have been touched thereafter. At the moment, only individual veterinary professionals are regulated and businesses are not. With such a hands-off setup, you can see why the private equity brigade was attracted by the financial possibilities that could come with rolling up independents into bigger national groups. Proper regulation and an ombudsman service for consumers look overdue. Again, though, the corporates should have little to fear: other sectors do this without a fuss.

On Wednesday, Mr Justice Mould delivered a ruling that could bring an end to a long-running battle that has generated discussion about how people can and should experience national parks. One international heritage body had said the plan for Elterwater slate quarry was tantamount to creating a “theme park” that threatened the area’s tranquility. However, supporters said the attraction would be underground and out of sight. They also argued that it was a way of welcoming a larger, more diverse group of visitors to the Lake District. The Elterwater zip wire plan was turned down in 2023 , but approved by planners in May 2024. The campaign group Friends of the Lake District then sought a judicial review that led to a two-day hearing in April this year. The group argued that planners had misunderstood their responsibilities but in his ruling the judge backed planning officials and dismissed the arguments made against the approval.

All rights reserved Michael Hill, the CEO of Friends of the Lake District, said they were now considering the implications of the judgment and whether to appeal. He said: “We are disappointed, but we are energised by the fact that we’ve managed to make a point about what we stand for.” Hill added that the charity had nothing against people coming to learn about the industrial history of the quarry, “but we believe that the way the attraction is configured with zip wires is going to trivialise the experience. It will not honour the memory of the quarrymen and the miners who worked there. It will just be an adrenaline experience.” Others to object to the plan include the International Council on Monuments and Sites (Icomos), an advisory body to the international heritage organisation Unesco. Icomos said the plans imperilled the area’s “tranquil and contemplative” quality and described the attraction as being “of a type that would transform the quarry or part of it into a theme park and would trivialise the experience of an important aspect of the Lake District’s heritage”. The envisaged use of the caverns was more “adventure tourism” than “cultural heritage interpretation”, it added. Hill said the stakes were high and he feared the Lake District could lose its Unesco world heritage status. “ Unesco took away world heritage site status from the docks at Liverpool a few years ago and they’ve done it for other places around the world,” he said. “And they could do it here if we carry on disregarding their advice about the special characteristics of this place.” skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson has refused to swear her in while the House is out of session amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, even though there is no rule that prevents him from doing so (he previously swore in two Florida Republicans while the House was in recess earlier this year). Grijalva, who won a special election in her state over three weeks ago and whose election was certified by Arizona’s secretary of state yesterday, is poised to provide the final signature on a bipartisan discharge petition needed to force a floor vote on whether to demand that the Trump administration release the Epstein files to Congress . “ This delay is not procedural, it is intentional ,” she said outside the US Capitol this morning. “He is doing everything in his power to shield this administration from accountability. That is not leadership, that is obstruction .” Yesterday evening, a group of Democrats and Grijalva marched to Johnson’s office, chanting “swear her in” and demanding that she be seated. This morning Johnson accused them of “storming” his office, showing “disdain for law enforcement” and playing “political games”. Grijalva said yesterday: “ I have not had one word from Speaker Johnson, not one word . We sent a letter. Now our attorney general is getting involved, because this is taxation without representation.” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has threatened legal action against Johnson for failing to seat Grijalva, and Grijalva said she has also been exploring her legal options for officially claiming her seat.

Greim replied that if a race-based remedy is involved, it must be in response to “intentional discrimination” . But Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the 15th amendment is not limited to “intentional” discrimination , to which Greim said the court has never held that the amendment addresses anything other than discrimination that is intentional. Sotomayor pushed back that this was not true and that the court has evaluated whether the effect of something is discrimination, regardless of whether that was the intent .

Supreme court appears poised to undercut key provision of Voting Rights Act As oral arguments at the supreme court continue, the conservative justices, who make up most of the bench, appear sympathetic to the case that new Louisiana congressional maps – which added a second majority-Black district – violate the constitution. At the heart of the case is section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits electoral maps that dilute the voting power of minority groups. Lawyers for the state of Louisiana, a group of “non-African American voters” and the Trump administration say that the court needs to do away with the 2024 map. If the court agrees, it would ultimately set a precedent that makes it considerably harder to bring redistricting lawsuits on the basis of race, and undercut section 2. Share Updated at 11.57 EDT Edward Greim , representing the “non-African American” challengers who appealed the 2024 congressional map, is now up. “It is time to reach a question this court has never reached and hold that section 2 alone is no compelling interest for racially gerrymandering citizens like the appellees,” Greim said. “The court should affirm and direct the district court to order a remedial map in time for the 2026 elections.” Share Updated at 11.57 EDT Aguinaga pushed back against Nelson’s argument that any gutting of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act would be “catastrophic”. “I think there’s been a lot of sky is falling rhetoric from the other side in this case,” Aguinaga said. “I’m not I don’t know what our legislature would do if the court rules in our favor … I don’t think the sky is going to fall.” Share Updated at 11.58 EDT A post about the possible impact in today’s case.

Share Updated at 11.58 EDT In responding to a question by justice Samuel Alito , the Louisiana solicitor general said that the Black population within Louisiana doesn’t satisfy one of the pre-requisites of the Gingles test – namely that the minority population is geographically compact . “You can identify pockets of black voters, but they are dispersed across the state there’s no way you can conceive of that population as compact,” Aguinaga said. Share Updated at 12.43 EDT An important note here, Louisiana has switched sides since March, the last time the supreme court heard this case. “We’ve taken the position that section 2, insofar as it requires race- based redistricting, is unconstitutional,” Aguinaga said. Share Updated at 11.59 EDT Now up is Benjamin Aguinaga, the solicitor general of Louisiana. “Race-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our constitution,” he said in his opening argument, adding that racial stereotypes are a consequence of the practice. “They assume, for example, that a black voter, simply because he is black, must think like other black voters, share the same interests and prefer the same political candidates, and this stereotyping system has no logical endpoint.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Nelson to answer the constitutionality question of the maps in question, particularly how it relates to the court’s 2023 decision that ruled race-based college admissions violate the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th amendment. Nelson said that the court “made it clear that it is still constitutional to use race to remedy specified discrimination”. She noted that decision, from two years ago, is “working more in our favor, we believe, than supporting our opponents”. Share Updated at 12.43 EDT Nelson was just asked by Justice Elena Kagan what the consequences would be if the court got rid of section 2. “I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson said. She went on to say that many of the Black representatives in Louisiana alone were elected from districts that exist because of the Voting Rights Act. Share Updated at 11.59 EDT One particular term we’re hearing a lot about in Nelson’s arguments is the “Gingles Test ” , which determines if a minority group is being subjected to voting dilution. “Gingles is an exacting test. It is data obsessive. It brings in experts and many other forms of evidence to establish a racial violation,” Nelson said. There are three criteria for a minority group to meet Gingles, which came about after a landmark supreme court decision in 1986. Here’s a breakdown, courtesy of ScotusBlog. The affected minority group is sufficiently large to elect a representative of its choice. The minority group is politically cohesive. The majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority group’s preferred candidates.

Among those whose visas were revoked was a South African national whose commentary attracted just 2,344 views. The individual “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk, saying ‘they’re hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom’ and alleging ‘he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash’”, according to the state department. A German national also had their visa cancelled for a post written in German that translated to: “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain.” The state department characterized this as celebrating Kirk’s death and attempting to justify his murder. The Brazilian stripped of his US visa is Tiago Santineli, a far-left standup comedian and online influencer who published a series of inflammatory tweets about Charlie Kirk after his assassination. In one 16 September post, cited by the state department on Monday, the 33-year-old comedian, who has more than 430,000 X followers, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi demonstration where they marched in tribute to him. Good riddance!” In a second part of the tweet, not cited by the state department, Santineli refers to the fatal shot to Kirk’s neck, writing: “If only someone had given Hitler this kind of tracheostomy before he had reached power. It’s too bad that Little Charlie Deep Throat was killed by another by another right-wing conservative, it takes a bit of the fun out of it, but it’s still worth it.” The controversial Brasília-born comedian, who has nearly a million YouTube subscribers, published several other incendiary messages about Kirk’s 10 September assassination. In one 18 September post, Santineli wrote beneath a photo of two well-known rightwing Brazilian politicians: “When are these [two] going to get the charlie kirk treatment?” Santineli did not reply to a request for comment but writing on X on 1 October he said he had received an email from the US embassy revoking his visa. The Brazilian boasted that that made him “the world’s first comedian to be banned from entering the US because of a joke”. “I can’t go to the US,” Santineli wrote. “But the worst thing is that Charlie Kirk will never be able to leave hahahahahahahahaha.” Another person singled out by the visa restrictions was Enrique “Kike” Gamarra, a veteran talkshow host who is often critical of Paraguay’s conservative government. In a recent programme, Gamarra said that Kirk’s killing “doesn’t absolve the way he lived his life. Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and died according to his own rules.” Gamarra declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Pro-government media in Paraguay celebrated the travel ban imposed on the broadcaster, which comes amid deepening ties between Trump’s White House and Paraguay’s president, Santiago Peña. The state department’s actions draw on a vast surveillance apparatus established in 2019 , when the department began requiring nearly all visa applicants worldwide to provide social media handles from platforms including Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn and Reddit used within the past five years. The policy, adopted under Trump’s first administration as part of “extreme vetting” measures, continued under Joe Biden, and expanded dramatically in March this year. A state department cable obtained by the Guardian at the time ordered consular offices to conduct comprehensive social media investigations of student visa applicants, with officers instructed to preserve screenshots of “potentially derogatory” content to create permanent records – even if posts were altered or deleted. The March directive established sweeping new grounds for visa denials, writing that “evidence that an applicant advocates for terrorist activity, or otherwise demonstrates a degree of public approval or public advocacy for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization” could justify rejection. It also mandated social media reviews of all students applying for visas, with fraud prevention units directed to flag and document content the administration deems threatening to national security. The directive followed high-profile visa revocations and arrests targeting pro-Palestinian campus activism, signaling an aggressive expansion of how immigration enforcement could be wielded against political speech. “The supreme court has been clear that noncitizens have a right to freedom of speech” Fitzpatrick said. “In America, no one should fear a midnight knock at the door because of their political views.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/us-visas-charlie-kirk-reaction,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b06962b66732e21313d656436c2208bb5434c2f/306_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cbe82f32401f3c2a1b5d28cf2700dce",2025-10-15T17:03:59+00:00,61ed63663749dd3573c4565f351ae102b1b11456
e4d39684ed78,US supreme court appears poised to weaken key pillar of Voting Rights Act,,"The conservative majority on the US supreme court appeared poised to weaken a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act after a lengthy oral argument on Wednesday. “This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases, but they should not be indefinite and should have an endpoint. What exactly do you think that endpoint should be?” asked Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a key swing vote in the case, to Janai Nelson, a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, who was defending the maps. “The bottom line is get rid of section two,” said Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal justice on the court, towards the end of the argument, summarizing how she understood the plethora of arguments coming from lawyers attacking the maps. The case, Louisiana v Callais , involves a dispute over Louisiana’s sixth congressional district, which snakes from Shreveport in the state’s north-west to Baton Rouge in the center. Louisiana Republicans drew the district after a successful lawsuit filed by Black voters under section two of the Voting Rights Act , which outlaws election procedures and practices that discriminate on the basis of race. Two maps of Louisiana congressional districts. One from 2022 shows one majority-Black district, the other from 2024 shows two. But the question at the heart of the case could have far-reaching implications. After hearing argument in the case in March, the supreme court took the unusual step of not issuing a ruling at the end of last term. Instead, it instructed the parties to address an explosive question: whether Louisiana’s decision to create an additional majority-minority district violated the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution, which guarantee equal protection under the law and prohibit denying the right to vote based on someone’s race. In asking the question, the supreme court set up a blockbuster case on whether section two itself was constitutional when it comes to redistricting. A ruling holding section two unconstitutional would dramatically upend American election law and strip minority voters of a tool to challenge discrimination. For decades, voting rights lawyers have turned to section two to challenge district lines – from congressional districts to school boards – that dilute the influence of minority voters. Supreme court precedent requires plaintiffs to clear a series of challenging hurdles in order to strike down an existing district. The supreme court could affirm the constitutionality of section two, strike it down altogether, or leave the provision intact but make it much harder to bring section two lawsuits. The state of Louisiana, along with a group of white voters, is urging the justices to say section two is unconstitutional. “Race-based redistricting harms voters – and by extension, our political system – by sorting them based on their skin color and then divvying them up between minority and non-minority districts,” lawyers for Louisiana wrote in a brief to the supreme court. The Trump administration has also filed a brief with the court urging the justices to raise the bar plaintiffs need to meet to win a section two case. On the other side of the case are Black voters who filed the original Voting Rights Act suit that produced Louisiana’s current congressional map. They urge the justices to uphold section two of the Voting Rights Act. “Without section 2, minority voters would continue to face extreme instances of discrimination,” their lawyers write. Without section 2, jurisdictions could simply eliminate minority opportunity districts even where they remain necessary for voters of color to have any opportunity to elect candidates of choice, wiping out minority representation and re-segregating legislatures, city councils, and school boards – as some have recently attempted to do.” The case is returning to the justices after a long and twisted legal saga. After the 2020 census, Louisiana Republicans passed a congressional map in which Black voters only comprised a majority in one of the state’s six congressional districts. A group of Black voters sued under section two of the Voting Rights Act in March of 2022, arguing that it was possible to draw a reasonably configured district in the Baton Rouge area that would give Black voters a majority in a second-congressional district. A district court judge and US court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed with them, ordering a new map. The supreme court let the map go into effect for the 2024 elections. Map of the Black population of Baton Rouge, which in the previous congressional map was divided. With the midterm elections fast approaching, Louisiana Republicans decided to draw a new map. Rejecting proposals from the plaintiffs, they adopted the strangely shaped Shreveport-to-Baton Rouge district for political reasons, saying they wanted to preserve the seats of powerful Republicans, including Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and Julia Letlow, a member of the appropriations committee. The US supreme court has said there is nothing federal courts can do to stop redistricting for partisan advantage. A Black Democrat, Cleo Fields, won the new majority-Black congressional district last fall. But when the new map went into effect, a group of white voters sued in a different court, saying that the new map violated the 14th and 15th amendments because it sorted voters based on their race. A three-judge panel agreed and struck down the new map and the supreme court heard the case on appeal.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/us-supreme-court-voting-rights-act,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895e9a100dd3c12e9ebefd984f75b663fedf7f50/296_0_2808_2248/master/2808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cdfdb8015486614c943029083e3e4467",2025-10-15T16:48:09+00:00,53a4783f9692c26715bfc20718df9e4fb6152e84
356a15d7a1f3,US falls out of world’s 10 most powerful passports list for first time in 20 years,,"For the first time in two decades, the US has dropped out of the world’s top 10 most powerful passports, marking a significant dethroning for the global superpower. According to the latest Henley Passport Index , a ranking that measures how many countries a traveler can visit without needing a visa, the US passport now ranks 12th globally, sharing the position with Malaysia. Just last year, the US was in seventh place, before slipping to 10th in July of this year. Ten years ago, it was at the top of the list. “The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings – it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics,” Christian H Kaelin, chair of Henley & Partners and creator of the index, said in a press release . “Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.” Asian countries currently dominate the upper ranks. Singapore leads with visa-free access to 193 destinations, followed by South Korea with 190, and Japan with 189. Henley & Partners, a London-based firm specializing in citizenship and residency consulting, has compiled these rankings for about 20 years using data from the International Air Transport Association. The drop coincides with stricter US immigration and travel policies under the Trump administration , which initially targeted unauthorized migration but have since extended to wider crackdowns on tourism, foreign workers and international students. Reciprocity plays a big role in a country’s rankings, Henley & Partners noted, pointing out that while US passport holders can currently access 180 destinations visa-free, the US itself allows only 46 other nationalities to enter its borders without a visa. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Recent access changes have contributed to lower rankings across the board. In April, Brazil ended visa-free entry for Americans, Canadians and Australians, citing a lack of reciprocity. Other countries have expanded visa waivers, but not for Americans. China and Vietnam, for instance, have excluded the US from newly expanded lists of countries eligible for visa-free tourism. According to Henley & Partners, countries that offer their citizens broad travel freedom but limit visa-free entry for others, such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have seen their passport strength stagnate or decline over recent years. The dramatic fall in ranking is already fueling a desire for duel citizenship among Americans, the firm says, signaling that standalone US citizenship may not be the superpower status it once was. “In coming years, more Americans will be acquiring additional citizenships in whatever way they can,” Peter J Spiro, professor of law at Temple University Law School, said in a statement . “Multiple citizenship is being normalized in American society.” While it may be a bit of an exaggeration, as one social media poster recently put it, “dual citizenship is the new American dream.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/most-powerful-passports-world-list,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae6968f69d283a8987f362ceb7e0a45f81b0614/425_0_4349_3481/master/4349.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c6947efd21bfb848cfcefc836a544fc1",2025-10-15T16:48:03+00:00,be9641c1c296bd330b116498bc6c62a488d77cbc
3e369461fd9d,"Almost 70% of US adults would be deemed obese based on new definition, study finds",,"Almost 70% of adults in the US would be deemed to have obesity based on a new definition, research suggests. The traditional definition of obesity, typically based on having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, has long been contentious, not least as it does not differentiate between fat and muscle. In an effort to tackle the issue, in January medical experts from around the world called for a new definition to be adopted. This would encompass people either with a BMI greater than 40; or those with a high BMI and at least one raised figure for measures such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or waist-to-height ratio; or those with two such raised figures regardless of BMI; or those with direct measures of excess body fat based on scans. In addition, they said obesity should be split into two categories: clinical obesity – where there are signs of illness – and pre-clinical obesity, where there are not. Now research suggests the revamped definition could result in a dramatic rise in the prevalence of obesity among adults in the US. Dr Lindsay Fourman, the first author of the study, from Mass General Brigham in the US, said the increase in obesity prevalence based on the new definition was striking, and was largely driven by people who would not have been considered to have obesity based on their BMI alone. “Recognising people with [this type of] obesity can lead to more accurate health risk stratification,” she said. “For example, someone with BMI 23 but excess abdominal fat could benefit from lifestyle interventions such as improving diet and increasing physical activity, even though their BMI is in the “normal” range. Their physician might also more closely monitor for obesity-related complications such as pre-diabetes or fatty liver.” Writing in the journal Jama Network Open , Fourman and colleagues describe how they applied the traditional and new definitions of obesity to a nationally representative group of 301,026 participants, aged 18 to 80, who had enrolled in a US-based health study between the end of May 2017 and the end of September 2023. While traditional BMI-based criteria would mean 128,992, or 43%, of the participants were deemed to have obesity, the team found this increased by nearly 60% using the new definition, encompassing 206,361, or 69%, of participants. For those aged 70 years or older, prevalence under the new definition was 78%. Almost all those with obesity under the traditional definition also had obesity under the new definition, with only 678 participants no longer considered to have obesity. However, the new definition meant 78,047 participants who would not previously have been considered to have obesity based on BMI alone would be deemed to have the condition. “Our data show that these individuals have a heightened risk of organ dysfunction and long-term health complications, suggesting that their classification as having obesity is clinically appropriate,” said Fourman. Of those deemed to have obesity without a high BMI, 48% had clinical obesity. For those who had obesity based on their BMI together with other measures, this figure was 56%. The researchers noted that while the prevalence of obesity under the new definition was similar between men and women, men showed a greater increase upon the use of the new definition, adding that while prevalence increased by a similar number of percentage points across racial groups, the greatest relative rise was among Asian individuals. Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the study, described it as thought-provoking and said further research was now needed, but noted that the newly proposed definition of obesity had yet to be adopted. “Regardless of definitions, it’s clear that current obesity levels pose major challenges especially in high-income countries like the UK, with rising weight levels underscoring the urgent need for more effective strategies to support healthier living,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/15/almost-70-of-us-adults-would-be-deemed-obese-based-on-new-definition-study-finds,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4e49e4eecff321ac0b6d3602feaf724ff41563/763_0_4629_3704/master/4629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a366bb9fad05230da31ceaa545dd735",2025-10-15T15:00:39+00:00,a8aff5e7e0e6f77990f541169a3bb71786e70bbd
84f7ee3cc95a,Vets could be made to cap prescription prices after UK watchdog investigation,,"Vets in the UK could be forced to cap prescription prices after an investigation by the markets watchdog found pet owners may be paying twice as much for some common medicines from practices than online. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found pet owners pay 16.6% more on average at large vet groups than at independent practices. It said the £6.3bn market was not fit for purpose and needed to be modernised. The watchdog has proposed 21 measures, including making vet businesses cap the cost of providing prescriptions at £16; publish comprehensive price lists; make clear if they are part of a large group; and ensure that their policies and processes allow vets to act in the best interests of pets and pet owners. The CMA advised clear price information on treatments and cremations, with prices in writing for treatments costing more than £500 and itemised bills, and pricing breakdowns for pet care plans. It also proposed creating a comprehensive price comparison website. The regulator launched its formal investigation last year after an initial inquiry prompted an “unprecedented response” from 56,000 people, including customers and vet professionals. Publishing its findings on Wednesday, the CMA said prices increased by 63% between 2016 and 2023, considerably faster than general inflation. It found owners were often unaware of the prices of common services and whether their local practices were part of large national chains, and that customers had no effective way of comparing vet prices and may be paying twice as much for common medicines from practices than online, often hundreds of pounds more. The findings are provisional, with interested parties having until next month to make submissions before a final decision is published by next March. Martin Coleman, the chair of the CMA’s inquiry group, said: “Pet owners are often left in the dark, not knowing whether their practice is independent or part of a chain or what a fair price looks like. “They are sometimes committing to expensive treatment without understanding the price in advance. And they do not always feel confident asking for a prescription or buying medicine online – even when it could save them hundreds of pounds.” The current regulatory system dates back to 1966. It only regulates individual veterinary professionals and not vet businesses, even though most practices are part of a large corporate group. The CMA found that acquisitions of vet practices by larger companies led to an increase of 9% in average prices four years later. It said many of the concerns raised with it related to the six large veterinary groups, which own the majority of practices. Two of them are listed companies (CVS and Pets at Home), three (IVC, VetPartners and Medivet) are owned by private equity investors, and Linnaeus is owned by Mars Petcare. Rob Williams, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said there were positives in the CMA’s findings but the industry had concerns that some of the measures outlined would affect the delivery of services. “In particular, we need clarity on the proposed introduction of comprehensive price lists,” he said, “Because how vet care is delivered is varied and complex and unless the CMA gets this right, it could end up creating greater confusion for consumers, which in turn could have a negative impact on animal welfare.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said Vets for Pets agreed that rules underpinning the sector needed to be updated and had been “calling on government to make progress on this for over two years”. Medivet, which has more than 350 branches in the UK, said more than half were co-owned with vets and that it already published prices for key treatments online. It said it would engage constructively with the CMA. Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection policy at the consumer group Which?, said: “Research has shown that many pet owners have been exposed to bad practices like unclear pricing, potentially excessive or unnecessary charges and no independent route for resolving their complaints. “It’s clear that the regulation of this market has become outdated, to the detriment of both pet owners and vet practices. The government must act quickly to modernise this sector.” Responding to the CMA’s findings, analysts at Jefferies said: “The tone appears to be sharper, and the transparency directives perhaps more extensive than we had anticipated, albeit no material pricing controls have been proposed.” Hargreaves Lansdown said: “The outcome is broadly as expected, but with no major negative surprises it should alleviate the uncertainty that’s been weighing on consumer and investor sentiment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/15/vets-could-be-made-to-publish-prices-after-uk-watchdog-investigation,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0762493938f6fa0ca89937b74aedd17f3582190d/448_360_2867_2294/master/2867.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d335c199546904c765baebe5cfd7d934",2025-10-15T08:22:36+00:00,2ae4208c27b61e5510fae4011c196e9b6861b9a6
7f5f383ce4ce,Banker bonuses to be paid faster after UK regulators loosen rules,,"UK regulators will speed up bonus payouts for high-earning bankers, watering down another important change introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. Since 2015 senior bankers have had to wait eight years before receiving their full bonuses to ensure individuals could be held financially accountable for any wrongdoing that came to light years later, or even after they left the bank. On Wednesday, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said they were halving that to four years. The watchdogs also went further than a previous consultation, saying they would now require a much smaller proportion of bonuses to be withheld from high-earning staff over the period. From Thursday, only 60% of the payout that falls above £660,000 will have to be deferred. The decision, which will be welcomed by the City, marks yet another rollback of post-financial crisis rules after the UK formally scrapped a banker bonus cap two years ago that limited bonuses to two times bankers’ salaries. The FCA and the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority, which have argued that the reduced deferral periods still provide enough time for any problems to surface, said the change would bring the UK “more closely in line with many other major jurisdictions”. In the EU, bankers’ bonuses are typically deferred for three to five years, while the US has no such restrictions. The PRA’s chief executive, Sam Woods, said: “These new rules will cut red tape without encouraging the reckless pay structures that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. These changes are the latest example of our commitment to boosting UK competitiveness.” Deferred bonus rules have been used to punish high-profile cases of wrongdoing in the City. Barclays froze and later cancelled £18m worth of pay and bonuses for its former chief executive Jes Staley, who resigned in 2021 after the FCA launched an investigation into his links to Jeffrey Epstein . Staley was later found to have misled the watchdog over his relationship to the former financier and sex offender. Efforts to relax bonus rules are part of a wider drive to cut red tape across the City, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, having claimed in her Mansion House speech in July that regulations were acting like as a “boot on the neck” of businesses and risked “choking off” innovation. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

c407fcdf19df,Royal Mail fined £21m by Ofcom for missing delivery targets,,"Royal Mail has been fined £21m for missing its annual delivery targets for first- and second-class mail, leading to millions of letters arriving late across the UK, according to the regulator Ofcom. This is the third time the 509-year-old postal service has been fined by the communications watchdog, and the third-biggest financial penalty Ofcom has ever issued to any company. Royal Mail delivered 77% of first class-mail and 92.5% of second-class mail on time during the 2024-25 financial year, Ofcom found. This was “well short” of its targets of 93% and 98.5%, the regulator said after a six-month investigation. It told Royal Mail it must urgently publish – and deliver – a credible improvement plan, or fines were likely to continue. While the company produced a plan for the last year, there was no improvement, Ofcom said, calling this “unacceptable”. The company has long struggled to deliver mail on time. It has been fined more than £16m over the past two years for failing to meet targets, and Ofcom began its investigation in May. In April the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský completed a drawn-out £3.6bn purchase of Royal Mail’s owner, International Distribution Services, after the takeover was approved by a UK government national security review. That same month the price of a first-class stamp rose again, up 5p to £1.70, while the cost of the second-class service rose by 2p to 87p. Ofcom gave IDS permission in July to loosen its universal service obligation (USO), ending second-class post on Saturdays and reduce the service to alternating weekdays from Monday to Friday. But this would take “many months” to roll out, the company said in September when it reported its first annual profit for three years – the first financial results since the takeover. Ian Strawhorne, Ofcom’s director of enforcement, said: “Millions of important letters are arriving late, and people aren’t getting what they pay for when they buy a stamp. “These persistent failures are unacceptable, and customers expect and deserve better. Royal Mail must rebuild consumers’ confidence as a matter of urgency. And that means making actual significant improvements, not more empty promises.” Under the USO, the company is required to deliver 93% of first-class mail within one working day of collection and 98.5% of second-class mail within three working days. Ofcom said it took any exceptional circumstances such as extreme weather into account. The regulator said: “The company breached its obligations by failing to provide an acceptable level of service without justification. It took insufficient and ineffective steps to try to prevent this failure, which is likely to have impacted millions of customers who did not get the service they paid for.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

9fec439ff2a1,Capita fined £14m for data protection failings in 2023 cyber-attack,,"The outsourcing company Capita has been fined £14m for data protection failings after hackers stole the personal information of 6.6 million people, including staff details and those of its clients’ customers. John Edwards, the UK information commissioner who levied the fine, said the March 2023 data theft from the group and companies it supported, including 325 pension providers, caused anxiety and stress for those affected. The £8m fine for Capita and £6m penalty for its Capita Pension Solutions arm come as UK businesses battle a wave of cyber-attacks in the recent wave that has crippled companies such as M&S and Jaguar Land Rover . Capita discovered the attack within 10 minutes but did not shut down the device that had been targeted by a malicious file for 58 hours, during which time the attacker was able to exploit its systems. Hackers took almost one terabyte of data, installed ransomware and reset all user passwords, locking out Capita staff. In some cases stolen information was sensitive, such as details of criminal records, financial data and “special category data”, which can include race, religion and sexual orientation. An original proposed fine of £45m was cut after Capita made representations it had made security improvements and engaged with regulators and the National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, which this week said the number of nationally significant cyber-attacks in the UK more than doubled in the past year. It called on businesses of all sizes to draw up contingency plans for if “your IT infrastructure [is] crippled tomorrow and all your screens [go] blank”. The information commissioner’s investigation found that prior to the attack, Capita failed to fix known vulnerabilities, its security operations centre was understaffed and it had carried out inadequate testing of defences despite looking after millions of personal and sometimes sensitive records. “Capita failed in its duty to protect the data entrusted to it by millions of people,” Edwards said. “The scale of this breach and its impact could have been prevented had sufficient security measures been in place. “When a company of Capita’s size falls short, the consequences can be significant. Not only for those whose data is compromised – many of whom have told us of the anxiety and stress they have suffered – but for wider trust among the public and for our future prosperity.

ea1424237670,"German retirees who continue working set to earn €2,000 a month tax-free",,"Germans who continue in the labour market beyond retirement age will be able to earn up to €2,000 (£1,750) a month tax-free on top of their pension under a scheme aimed at boosting economic growth and labour force participation rates. The “ Aktivrente ”, or active pension scheme, due to come into force in January, was promised on the campaign trail by the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, before he came into office five months ago. The government, a coalition of Merz’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and junior partners the Social Democrats (SPD), hopes the plan will incentivise post-retirement working. A draft law is expected to be approved by the cabinet on Wednesday – after Merz won over his Social Democrat sceptics earlier this month – then debated in the Bundestag. Merz has described the measure as an attempt to take the bull by the horns after three years of economic stagnation exacerbated by a lack of skilled labour, itself a consequence of a chronic demographic crisis. Fewer Germans are being born and increasing numbers are entering retirement. About 9% of the workforce – 4.8 million people – are due to retire in the next decade. The effects are felt on a daily basis across multiple sectors of the economy, including construction, education and health. The Aktivrente forms part of what Merz has called an “autumn of reforms” to bring radical structural reform to Europe’s largest economy. According to the wording of the draft bill, the tax incentive is expected to help “keep experience and knowledge in companies for longer” and bring about an “overall increase in the employment rate” as well as “contributing to economic growth and higher government revenues”. Both employees and employers will pay social security contributions on the extra moneys earned, which in turn should help to ease the strains on Germany’s health and pension systems, the finance ministry has said. The active pension is to apply to everyone who has reached the statutory retirement age of 67 and wishes to continue working in a job that is subject to social security contributions. Civil servants, tradespeople, the self-employed and those employed in agricultural and forestry industries are excluded from the scheme, however, drawing criticism from the German Economic Institute (IW). Ruth Maria Schüler, an IW pension expert, told the broadcaster BR24: “The question is how one justifies the fact that one type of income is tax-exempt while others are not?” Schüler added that it put some workers at an unfair advantage. The government estimates that if about one quarter of those eligible took up the offer, the annual cost to the state in tax losses would be just under €900m, though experts have said a figure of €1.9bn is more accurate. Regardless, the government says the focus should be on the longer-term benefits of the scheme. It argues that extra economic growth and the increase in social security contributions could mean the scheme will more than pay for itself within three years. The government has also been keen to promote the social benefits, saying that the Aktivrente could help to boost the standing of older people in society and provide a psychological uplift by encouraging those who enjoy working and are fit to continue beyond 67.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/german-retirees-who-continue-working-set-to-earn-1750-a-month-tax-free,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780ea5381bf4d96f4ebdbb0fd94c16b7cd9474fa/431_0_4337_3470/master/4337.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb6299f528876d35296d33df7b917268",2025-10-15T08:44:03+00:00,df6e063a575488cb14a7b5e7a20ca50aaccea8ab
cc85f825c8d5,Watchdog rules Red Tractor exaggerated its environmental standards,,"The UK’s advertising watchdog has upheld a complaint that Britain’s biggest farm assurance scheme misled the public in a TV ad about its environmental standards. The Red Tractor scheme , used by leading supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Morrisons to assure customers their food meets high standards for welfare, environment, traceability and safety , is the biggest and perhaps best known assurance system in Britain. About 45,000 of the UK’s farms are members of the scheme, and the advert promised that food carrying the logo had been “farmed with care”. But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint from the clean water campaign group River Action that the scheme’s environmental standards were exaggerated in the advert, last aired in 2023. In its judgment, the ASA said the ad must not be shown again in its current form. It said in future Red Tractor should make clear exactly what standards it is referring to when it uses the phrases “farmed with care” and “all our standards are met”. River Action said it made the complaint because it was concerned environmental standards relating to pollution were not being met on Red Tractor farms, including the claim “When the Red Tractor’s there, your food’s farmed with care … from field to store all our standards are met.” The ASA considered evidence from an Environment Agency report into Red Tractor farms, which found that 62% of the most critical pollution incidents occurred on Red Tractor farms between 2014 and 2019. Charles Watson, chair and founder of River Action, said large food retailers such as Tesco and Asda should lay out credible plans as to how they would move away from what he termed a “busted flush” of a certification scheme and instead support farmers whose working practices were genuinely sustainable. “Red Tractor farms are polluting the UK’s rivers, and consumers trying to make environmentally responsible choices have been misled,” said Watson. “This ASA ruling confirms what we’ve long argued: Red Tractor’s claims aren’t just misleading – they provide cover for farms breaking the law.” Red Tractor said its standards did not cover all environmental legislation. Therefore, data on compliance with environmental regulation should not be confused with farms’ compliance with Red Tractor’s requirements.

8543c89c07a7,Abolishing stamp duty won’t solve Britain’s housing crisis – but this radical property tax just might,,"T he UK’s property tax system is both inefficient and unfair. There is consensus among all political parties that something needs to be done. On the efficiency side, stamp duty is the main culprit: as a lump sum tax on property wealth paid at point of purchase, it discourages people to move as frequently as they should. It prevents people from realising their full economic potential by finding the right job, in the right area, or moving into a home suitable for their household size. In combination with high interest rates and sluggish growth, tax is contributing to UK property transactions reaching near record lows . Meanwhile, over a third of English households live in homes defined by the government as “under-occupied”, with two or more spare bedrooms; 90% of these are homeowners . Reforming stamp duty to free up some of these under-occupied properties – mainly concentrated in the baby-boomer generation now hitting retirement – could enhance growth, productivity and, potentially, the affordability crisis. I say “potentially” because it is well established that cuts to property taxes increase the demand for homeownership – and in turn, house prices. Apparently oblivious to this fact, both the Conservatives and Reform have proposed major cuts to the overall burden of property taxation. Kemi Badenoch has promised to abolish stamp duty on primary residences. Reform UK has proposed smaller reductions in stamp duty but added in cuts to inheritance tax and the restoration of some landlord tax reliefs. These policies will increase the demand for housing as a financial asset, and thus prices. Such reforms will most benefit those in London and the south-east with the most expensive homes and those who tend to move more often, while higher prices will largely cancel out the benefits for first-time buyers, just as help-to-buy subsidies did under the Conservatives. Rising prices will also weaken the incentives for empty-nesters to downsize. On the fairness side, council tax has become essentially a wealth tax on low- and middle-income earners. A tax based partly on locally provided public services and partly on property value, it is “band-based”, with those in higher bands paying more. The bands were introduced in 1991 and politicians have opted never to revalue them since then, despite house prices in certain areas of the country increasing sevenfold. As a result, households in the bottom 10% of property values pay, on average, over 0.7% of their property value annually, while those in the top 10% pay less than 0.1%. A multimillion pound mansion in Westminster can incur less tax than a modest home in the north of England. The property tax system also favours homeowners over renters and investment in property over other financial assets. Few people know it, but until 1963 there was a tax imposed on homeowners based on the rent they would have been paying had they been renting their homes: so called imputed rent, a tax still imposed in the Netherlands. Most importantly, given the explosive rise in house prices since the 1980s, homeowners enjoy 100% relief on capital gains tax on selling their primary residence. At £31.5bn in 2023-24 , this was the single largest tax relief in the country, equivalent to 1.15% of GDP, roughly the equivalent to running the Home Office and Ministry of Justice combined. All of these flaws combine to drive investment and lending in the UK towards property, rather than capital investment or equity in businesses. This is a major but largely neglected reason for the UK’s stagnant productivity and growth levels as well as the affordability crisis. Effective property tax reform requires an approach that represses investment demand and overconsumption of UK housing and frees up the stock for those who really need it. Among economists of both the left and right, there is increasing consensus that the UK needs a “big bang” rather than incremental reform. Replacing stamp duty and reforming council tax with an annual proportional property tax (PPT) of around 0.5% on the market value of the home – or the value of the land underneath it – would deal with both the inefficiency and unfairness challenges within the existing system. Research by the Fairer Share campaign shows it would benefit three quarters of the population, not least the “red wall” seats that Labour is haemorrhaging to Reform. Complications arise because council tax is also a vital source of funding for local public services; poorer areas could end up needing huge transfers from central government, resulting in even more fiscal centralisation. A recent proposal by ex-government adviser Tim Leunig argued for councils to control the funds from a PPT on homes under £500,000, setting their own rate and with a minimum payment of £800, while central government would take funds from properties above this value at a 0.5% rate, with a 0.8% rate for homes above £1m. Rumours circulated that the Treasury was seriously considering the scheme . The political risks would be high given the media is mostly hostile to any new tax on property. Labour needs to be bold and make the positive case for shifting the burden of tax off working peopleand on to unearned wealth. A radical reform of property taxation could help deliver three of its key policy goals: reducing rising wealth and regional inequalities, solving the housing crisis and stimulating economic growth.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/stamp-duty-britain-housing-crisis-property-tax-economists,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b872c71efd28714f3bee8fa98dbab05c291377e6/152_0_3791_3032/master/3791.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0777d78277dcc50b6d41215c976d36ef",2025-10-15T11:21:38+00:00,97bc88318a659e451dcefafb298f7c6e00d680c7
7e5abf8ebda0,"The IMF reckons the global economy remains ‘in flux’, but the Trump effect is real – and Australians aren’t fooled",,"T he latest IMF world economic outlook released on Wednesday does not mention “Trump” once in its 166 pages, but he is all over the report as his economic policies continue to make life difficult for everyone. But while the IMF reports Trump’s impact on the global economy is yet to be fully realised, Australian holidaymakers have already made their judgment and are deserting the US in droves. The IMF always likes to be polite. It titled the October 2025 world economic outlook “ Global Economy in Flux, Prospects Remain Dim ” rather than as I would have: “Trump remains dim, so who the hell knows what will happen.” Perhaps the worst aspect of Trump is how his actions, whether political, economic or social are regarded with initial concern, but then many in the media, and even our government, desperately try to suggest nothing has changed. But things are not normal. Whether it be calling for the jailing of the Chicago mayor and Illinois governor or boasting of extrajudicial killings , or suggesting to US generals that they should use US cities “ as training grounds for our military ”, things in the US are very far from normal. You would think our government, which is now spending billions on Aukus, might reflect that the US is quickly being run by an increasingly authoritarian regime and ponder this disconnect from normality. But no. The IMF notes that the world economy is not immune to this disconnect. The initial Trump tariffs announcements in April caused great consternation across the global economy and share markets. And yet largely the impact has been muted. Investors mostly have carried on, ignoring that while the tariffs may not be what Trump initially announced, they remain massively higher than they have been for decades: If the graph does not display click here In April the IMF estimated that the US economy would grow just 1.8%; now it has revised that up to 2.0%. Similarly in April the IMF thought Australia would be hurt in the crossfire between the US and China and downgraded its estimate for Australia’s economic growth to 1.6%. Now it has been revised up to 1.8%: If the graph does not display click here But we are not back to normal, and no one should think we are. The IMF notes that while trade uncertainty is less than it was in April, compared to any other time, chaos reigns. Yes, US trade policy is about half as uncertain as it was in April, but remains roughly 3,860% more uncertain than it was a year ago: If the graph does not display click here The main reason neither the US nor global economy have nose-dived due to the Trump administration’s policies is that he telegraphed them so obviously that everyone brought forward orders to get them in place before the tariffs came into effect. The IMF notes that “this gave a temporary boost to global activity in early 2025”. Some investors and our government may be treating the Trump situation as “normal” but it is clear Australians themselves have not been fooled. This week, the overseas arrivals and departures figures for August showed we are back travelling overseas in record numbers, while the figure for tourists coming to Australia continues to slowly recover from Covid: If the graph does not display click here While you may have been observing your friends’ Instagram posts from their holidays in the northern hemisphere, chances are a lot fewer are from the US than once was the case: If the graph does not display click here Generally, Australians’ travelling habits since the pandemic have moved away from the US. In the past year, 28% fewer travelled to the US than we did in the year before the pandemic. The only other places with a bigger drop are Russia, Israel and New Caledonia – three countries currently involved in war or civil unrest. The latest figures however also show the huge Trump effect. Ten per cent fewer Australians travelled to the US in August this year than they did last year. That was the only drop among our 10 most common travel destinations. And it was not just a one-month abnormality. Travel to the US during June, July and August was also down 3% compared to last year: If the graph does not display click here The Trump effect is real. It is not just Australians who have discarded the US. Last year Tourism Economics forecast that international arrivals to the US would rise 9% in 2025; now it forecasts an 8.2% fall. Across the global economy uncertainly abounds, and the IMF suggests things remain “in flux”. But people around the world, including Australians, have no such confusion. They are certain Trump has made the US less attractive, and unlike investors and a government continuing to hold tight to Aukus, they are not regarding his authoritarian rhetoric and policies as normal.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2025/oct/16/usa-economy-trump-effect-imf-economic-outlook-australian-tourists-avoiding,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f89a27ffe03b01eee6928f16722dd285750564/98_0_2911_2329/master/2911.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0020b610cbf2e32eea61abdc124d625d",2025-10-15T14:00:41+00:00,adef745aed620fe4ea454436299d917de900f5fe
a4992ae07ca9,Big Tech deploys Orwellian doublespeak to mask its democratic corrosion,,"There is something fundamentally undemocratic about the constant stream of new AI releases as the industry scrambles to prove its value in the face of a rapidly inflating market bubble. Each shiny new toy emerges from the hype machine that casts progress as inevitable and resistance as futile as the industry builds moats around their advantage at the expense of everyday people. In the past few weeks three new applications of AI have landed that could each have a profound impact on our shared reality: OpenAI’s new video platform, Sora; the scaling of a virtual companion called “Friend” and Meta’s push to import its advertising model into chatbots. The launch of Sora to a select group of users was juiced by a deepfake of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shoplifting, which is totally on brand given how he has trained his model on the stolen property of creators. From porn to politics to performers’ IP, Sora comes with no discernible positive use case. It will simply flood the public square with slop, undermining any pretence of shared reality in pursuit of dopamine-charged clicks. “Friend” is a wearable pendant that collects a user’s conversations and spatial movements to inform a sycophantic buddy whose job is to send supportive text messages. Another companion startup, “Replika”, embeds this connection with voice and a happy ending. What these tools will do to human connection, especially among young people navigating intimate personal relationships for the first time, appears to have been given very little thought. Meanwhile, Meta has begun using chatbot interactions to target ads, evidence that the surveillance capital model that has so “ enshittified ” social media is about to cross the AI frontier. The customer becomes the product, their prompts shaping their user profiles which in turn shape their behaviour to keep them producing more data to repurpose and exploit. Thinking through the impact of each of these individual products is only a small part of the scrutiny they demand; it’s when we look at the intersections that come with rapid diffusion that we should get really alarmed. Consider, for example, how these three products might connect with each other in the context of an election campaign: a political actor purchases advertising within a chatbot to lead users to its version of the truth, packaging targeted fake videos all reinforced by their little AI friend. This is not science fiction; this is just the next step in the atomisation of our civic selves, a “politics of me” powered by misinformation and automated self-reinforcement that will further erode our capacity for coordinated collective action. Big Tech deploys Orwellian doublespeak to mask its democratic corrosion; blandishments of “freedom” override accountability and regulation is decried as “state control” rather than the expression of our collective will. “Techno-fascism” was a term framed more than a decade ago by historian Janis Mimura to describe the proactive union of industry and government power that override liberal norms, where individuals forgo their interests for a predetermined greater good. While the “F-bomb” is liberally dropped by liberals, it seems an accurate description of the current relationship between tech, the state and us as technology asserts its power to shape social evolution. Since Big Tech took the front row at Trump’s inauguration, Elon Musk’s Doge has scraped the US government’s databases; OpenAI’s Stargate project to drain the world’s energy has been greenlit , while moves to place guardrails and redlines around AI have been repudiated at home and abroad. On a deeper level the Silicon Valley’s libertarian billionaires Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen have propelled JD Vance within a heartbeat of the presidency, while the work of Curtis Yarvin who argues for the “CEO as king” is gaining traction in all the wrong places. Closer to home, Australia’s government appears frozen in the headlights, proselytising the “opportunity” of the technology and doing a “gap analysis” on existing laws while trying to avoid a trade war with the United States. All this would be perfectly sensible if the tech industry wasn’t a law unto itself. If AI products were a car or a new medicine, the impact would be tested and modelled before it was let loose on the community. But simply by being new, Big Tech seeks a free pass based on a trust that it hasn’t earned. Deferring these decisions to representatives elected via the three-year election cycle is not enough to meet such rapid evolutions. Doing nothing is actually doing something, adding to the concentration of tech power. The good news is there are alternative approaches. When Uber came to Taiwan, the then digital minister Audrey Tang convened an extensive program of citizen juries to set the ground rules for how the company would operate, part of that nation’s “always-on” model of deliberative democracy. British academic Dan McQuillan argues in his book Resisting AI – An Anti-Fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence for workers and community councils to have a real say over the integrating of technology into workplaces, schools and communities. AI resistance is also a collective choice: to use AI mindfully, to give up our data sparingly, to ignore synthetic news and culture and demand to know when it is putting itself forward as something more genuine than it is, to start our thinking with a blank page. The AI industry purports to provide us with what we as humans most yearn: intelligence, agency, companionship. But it is these very qualities that are our only defence against its techno-fascist tendencies.

a5d4b65e1dbf,Trump threatens vulnerable countries before key shipping emissions vote,,"Donald Trump’s government is putting intense pressure on vulnerable countries to vote against measures that would force shipping companies to pay for their carbon emissions . US officials have written to countries that support the measure and besieged them with phone calls threatening to impose tariffs, withdraw visa rights and take other retaliatory action. The moves appear to be having some impact and, if successful, could throw more than two decades of tortuously slow progress on decarbonising the shipping industry into reverse. Representatives from most of the 176 member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which governs global seafaring, are meeting at its headquarters in London for four days of talks. They are expected to approve new rules that would levy charges on ships based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The money raised would go to funding the transition to cleaner fuels for ships and to help developing countries. The pricing mechanism could start operating from 2028, raising an estimated $10bn (£7.5bn) a year, and would be the first time that shipping companies had to pay for the damage they do to the climate. Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions currently, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. Although the carbon levy was approved at an IMO meeting in April , the complex procedures of the UN body mean it must be reaffirmed by two-thirds of countries this week. After that, countries have a further 10 months to decide whether to accept it, followed by a period of assessment and refinement before new rules can finally be introduced. Trump is attempting to halt the measure. At the April meeting, US officials issued a public letter objecting to the carbon pricing mechanism and walked out of the talks , which continued without them. Since then, Trump has spoken publicly of his opposition to the measure. On Friday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, along with energy secretary Chris Wright and transport secretary Sean Duffy, issued a public statement threatening to slap tariffs on countries that supported the measure, as well as other commercial penalties such as port fees on ships that complied. The statement also hinted at targeting individual negotiators in the talk by “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers”. Behind the scenes, the US has also issued a démarche – a diplomatic document – seen by the Guardian, which lists retaliatory measures. “Our government will consider reciprocal measures to offset any fees charged to US ships and compensate American people any related economic harm from any adopted greenhouse gas emissions measures,” the document reads. “These measures could include, but are not limited to, the following actions to those countries supporting the net zero framework: levying additional tariffs; increasing port levies on ships owned, operated by or flagged in your country; reexamining eligibility for crew members for visa categories; increasing downline disembarkation fees for your nationals visiting US ports.” Many people involved in the negotiations said that developing countries, and some developed countries, were concerned by the threats. In April, the measures passed with the support of 63 IMO member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained. Several small Pacific island states abstained because they felt the measure was too weak and should impose stiffer penalties. Working alongside the US against the measure are several petrostates, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. The Guardian understands that Saudi’s approach is to offer sweeteners and hold out the promise of future deals or economic opportunities to entice developing countries to change their minds. Riyadh is also thought to have offered to pay the travel costs for officials from countries not present in April to attend this week and vote against the measures. Depending on who turns up, it could take only a dozen or so countries to flip their votes – or a larger number of previous absentees to turn up and vote against it – to block the motion. It is understood that several countries are now considering opposition, including the Philippines, Turkey, Argentina and Australia. International Maritime Organization secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez remains hopeful that April’s compromise will hold at this week’s meeting. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, said he believed the consensus formed in April would prevail. “Last April, we reached a compromise – which is the text we have in front of us for adoption – on the technical and pricing mechanism measures. This is an agreement from the membership, based on years of negotiations, input, assessment and analysis,” he said. “My goal is, and always will be, to keep all the organisation together. There are concerns and we will address those concerns as we move forward.” He added that a vote could be called if the consensus was unclear. “For me, [this] is the meeting where we’re going to adopt the amendments. How we do it is a mechanism that the member states will decide, based on established legal practices.” Tuvalu was one of the Pacific nations that abstained in April, finding the compromise agreement for a levy too weak. Simon Kofe, minister of transport and energy for Tuvalu, had proposed several amendments this week that would strengthen the compromise, including the urgent setting up of a fund to disburse revenues generated by the proposed measure. He said: “While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific island nations are forced to consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake. We call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival.” A US government spokesperson said: “We are actively engaging with countries on the extremely flawed proposal, as well as exploring and preparing to act on remedies including tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies. We will also be engaging our like-minded partners and allies to propose they take similar measures. We will fight hard to protect the American people and their economic interests.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/15/trump-threatens-vulnerable-countries-before-key-shipping-emissions-vote,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe27564f239300472c38f21c7a05a7f4dd1309fc/434_0_3383_2706/master/3383.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175be223edf80bd6f6fc887ef2b64b22",2025-10-15T09:00:33+00:00,392bb973862a77b7dfd6b048b0a3e759dad03f99
930c2d068018,EU to propose short-term rental rules to tackle ‘social crisis’ in housing,,"The EU executive will propose rules to tackle the “huge problem” of short-term rentals via platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com, as it seeks to confront the “social crisis” of people struggling to afford a home, its first-ever housing commissioner has said. In an interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers, Dan Jørgensen said it was time for Brussels policymakers to take housing seriously or cede ground to anti-EU populists, who, he said, did not have the answers to the shortage of affordable homes. Dan Jørgensen cited the urgency of ‘the social crisis’. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA “If we don’t, as policymakers, take this problem seriously and acknowledge that this is a social problem and needs action, then … the anti-EU populists will win,” he said, adding that Brussels had so far “failed to deliver” on some of the key elements of the housing crisis. Jørgensen, a Danish Social Democrat, has been tasked with crafting the EU’s first-ever affordable housing plan, which is expected to be made public in December. He said publication had been brought forward from 2026, citing the urgency of “the social crisis”. Brussels has traditionally stayed out of housing policy, but Jørgensen insisted it was a matter for the EU. “The upcoming housing plan will cover areas where it is indeed very clear that [housing] is a European competence and where we have failed to deliver so far … One of those areas is short-term rentals, where we do need more European rules,” he said. Protesters in Lisbon call for more measures to fight the housing crisis in the city. Photograph: Gonçalo Fonseca/The Observer Short-term accommodation, rented via Airbnb and other websites, has boomed across European cities in recent years and been blamed for driving up rents, forcing local people out of historic centres, and turning residential neighbourhoods into tourist zones. Jørgensen said short-term rentals were “a huge problem in many cities” but did not name specific websites or detail any proposals. Concerns about short-term rentals have come against the backdrop of a general increase in rents and mortgages. Between 2010 and 2023, house prices in the EU increased by 48% and rents by 22% at a time when inflation grew 36%, according to the EU statistics agency Eurostat . Some renters and would-be buyers saw much steeper increases: during the same period, rents in Estonia went up by 211%, in Lithuania, 169%, and in Ireland, 98%. By 2023, nearly 9% of the EU population spent 40% or more of their disposable income on housing, including 29% of the population in Greece, 15% in Denmark and 13% in Germany. Jørgensen, who is also tasked with reducing energy prices, said the EU’s affordable housing plan would address the “financialisation” of housing, because “it is clear that when housing becomes a commodity, something that is used for speculation with no need to take into consideration the rest of the society, then of course that potentially causes problems”. He declined to discuss policy details, but said the commission was studying how member states had sought to eliminate or reduce this problem, such as requirements on developers to build a percentage of affordable homes. Ursula von der Leyen’s commission has some radical ideas to draw on, which could test EU law. Spain is planning a 100% tax on the value of properties bought by non-EU residents, while socialist MEPs want the commission to consider a ban on foreign purchases of real estate. The European Commission , Jørgensen said, was also considering how to better protect tenants’ rights, as well as loosening state-aid rules to make it easier for governments to subsidise or confer tax breaks on housing companies. Von der Leyen, the commission president, created the housing post in 2024 to help secure the votes from the socialists in the European parliament that were necessary for her to clinch a second term. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images Socialist MEPs, who have long sought a bigger EU role on housing, were rattled after losing votes in the 2024 European elections when nationalists and far-right parties made gains. Rising prices and the cost of living were found to be the main factors that motivated people in their votes, cited by 42% of respondents in a European parliament survey after the elections. Last month von der Leyen told MEPs the EU needed “a radical overhaul of the way we tackle this issue” and promised to convene “the first EU housing summit to ensure it is at the top of our agenda”. EU leaders are to discuss housing at a summit next week where they can set out their views on the upcoming strategy. Diplomats have given a guarded welcome to the talks, but stressed that any European angle must consider variation in housing markets across the 27 member states. So far, socialist MEPs have been making most of the running, but some of their ideas are likely to prove controversial, such as a call for €300bn (£260bn) in EU grants and loans for housing, as well as proposals to overhaul EU fiscal rules to encourage governments to spend more in this area. Jørgensen declined to name any spending target – “we are talking about very, very big numbers” – but said public money would be needed to incentivise private capital in some cases. EU member states, he said, already had more options to spend EU funds on housing than in the past, citing the midterm review to the current budget that made available €15bn for housing, up from €7bn. He said it was time for the EU to look at housing with “fresh eyes”, drawing a comparison with the Covid pandemic when the health emergency triggered an unprecedented joint procurement of vaccines . “So as it happened with the Covid crisis, when we stand in new situations we need to also redefine the role of the European Union,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/eu-executive-short-term-rental-rules-affordable-housing-plan,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7f85b3fd95b5ec4082f11a93d15a74cf1ef32b/1025_0_5127_4101/master/5127.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=250811137383c2f3ec569a7c69e64e4d",2025-10-15T04:01:13+00:00,57c0a035af5c85a1f8d653ba641ba4d088c0545b
22ded3c09a05,"UK must prepare buildings for 2C rise in global temperature, government told",,"Britain must prepare for global heating far in excess of the level scientists have pegged as the limit of safety, the government’s climate advisers have warned, as current plans to protect against extreme weather are inadequate. Heatwaves will occur in at least four of every five years in England by 2050, and time spent in drought will double. The number of days of peak wildfire conditions in July will nearly treble for the UK, while floods will increase in frequency throughout the year, with some peak river flows increasing by 40%. Campaigners warned that the impacts foreseen by the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) scientists would make the UK “look very different, very quickly”, within 25 years. Existing buildings and infrastructure should be upgraded to withstand temperatures of at least 2C higher than normal by 2050, instead of the 1.5C nations are hoping to keep as a limit, the committee said. Any new constructions intended to last decades should be prepared for 4C above preindustrial levels – a level at which the world will face global devastation. Julia King, a crossbench peer and chair of the subcommittee of the statutory adviser that deals with adaptation to the impacts of climate breakdown, said current preparations were inadequate. “Up to now, adaptation has been underresourced and underfunded,” she said. “A lack of action to address [the impacts of the climate crisis] will leave the UK dangerously exposed to future effects. There’s a lot of climate change already baked in.” King said the 1.5m new homes the government was planning must be resilient to higher temperatures. The impacts of global heating were already being felt in the NHS, in schools, on transport, communication and energy networks, and this would only worsen, she added. The CCC had not yet estimated the cost of making infrastructure more resilient to 2C and up to 4C of heating, but King said it was unlikely to be costly, and would be lower than the cost of not acting. Even if it was not possible to make buildings resilient to 4C temperature rises now, they could be constructed in such a way as to make it easy to upgrade them in future, she said. The difference between 1.5C and 2C of global heating is much greater than many people realise, according to Martin Juckes, of the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the committee’s work. He pointed to research that showed “tipping points” could be triggered at 2C above preindustrial levels that would result in far bigger and swifter impacts, such as the collapse of ice sheets that would raise sea levels and disrupt the climate further. Douglas Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said: “Alarm bells should be ringing in government that doubled chances of heatwaves, droughts and wildfires will make life in the UK look very different, very quickly: impacting how safe we are in our homes, what food we eat, how we get around – and UK households, businesses and emergency services are already struggling with worsening weather shocks.” The CCC was responding to a request from Emma Hardy, minister for flooding in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to set out guidelines the government could use to prepare for flooding and similar impacts. Parr said all government departments must take note. “This has implications right across government in health, housing, transport, and business, so No 10 must not make the error of leaving this to [Defra],” he said. “The Treasury must generate funds for the UK to adapt to the changing climate by taxing the fossil fuel companies who are making billions from ramping up the crisis – it’s the feasible and fair way to fund the protections we urgently need.” In May, the CCC will publish a report on what a “well-adapted” UK could look like, laying out in detail the steps that need to be taken to safeguard infrastructure against future climate risks. King also expressed concern over the turn that the UK’s political debates over the climate crisis have taken. The work of the committee had “always been with pretty much cross-party support”, she said. “It’s very disappointing to see that support fracturing, particularly with the leader of the Conservatives saying she would withdraw the Conservatives from the Climate Change Act . I hope we aren’t going to lose the consensus about the need to address climate impacts.” A separate report, also published on Wednesday, found that the UK must radically overhaul its food systems, to prepare for the impacts of the climate crisis. Food security must be on a par with national security, with targets for shifting people away from eating so much meat, and a reduction in UK livestock numbers, according to the report, which was written with input from 150 scientists. Other recommendations include a new “national food system transformation committee”, reporting to the prime minister, and sweeping overhaul of farm subsidies to prioritise the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and preserving nature. Such measures would boost the economy, save billions of pounds for the NHS and improve living standards, the authors said. Neil Ward, a professor at the University of East Anglia and co-lead of the Agri-Food for Net Zero network of 11 universities that coordinated the report, said: “Pressures from climate change, global shocks and poor diets mean significant change to our food system is inevitable over the next 50 years. If we act now, we still have time to shape our future, and positively impact national security, national health, economic growth and climate change. If we do not, change will be forced on us by crisis.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

62f19d06adc1,JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failures,,"The boss of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, has warned over further losses linked to the private credit sector, saying more “cockroaches” could emerge after the collapse of the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor and the car parts supplier First Brands . The bank said on Tuesday that although it had no exposure to First Brands, which sells car parts across the US, it had taken a $170m (£128m) hit from Tricolor, which collapsed amid fraud allegations last month. Both firms had been backed by private credit within the so-called shadow banking sector, which is not directly regulated and is not forced to disclose the level of risks on their books. Regulated banks such as JP Morgan are exposed to the private credit sector, either by lending directly to private businesses, or lending to the private credit firms themselves. The links between banks and private credit have raised concerns about the fallout of any downturn across the $3tn (£2.3tn) industry. Dimon said further failures were likely to emerge. “My antenna goes up when things like that happen. I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. And so everyone should be forewarned at this point,” he said during an analyst call. When asked whether there were inherent risks in lending to the shadow banking sector, including private credit firms, Dimon said that it was a broad category but that weak links would be revealed during a downturn. “These are very smart players: they know what they’re doing, they’ve been around a long time. But they’re not all very smart. And we don’t even know the standards of other banks [that] are underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that some of those won’t be as good as you think.” He suggested this would shake out as part of the normal credit cycle. “We’ve had a benign credit environment for so long, I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate more than other people think when in fact it’s a downturn. And hopefully it’ll be a fairly normal credit cycle … but we think we’re quite careful and obviously we scour the world for things we should be worried about.” Dimon admitted that JP Morgan also made “mistakes” but said it made sure to “scour” its operations and detect any further risks when potential issues arose.

3100ec31c8f4,OpenAI will allow verified adults to use ChatGPT to generate erotic content,,"OpenAI announced plans on Tuesday to relax restrictions on its ChatGPT chatbot, including allowing erotic content for verified adult users as part of what the company calls a “treat adult users like adults” principle. OpenAI’s plan includes the release of an updated version of ChatGPT that will allow users to customize their AI assistant’s personality, including options for more human-like responses, heavy emoji use, or friend-like behavior. The most significant change will come in December, when OpenAI plans to roll out more comprehensive age-gating that would permit erotic content for adults who have verified their ages. OpenAI did not immediately provide details on its age verification methods or additional safeguards planned for adult content. The company launched a dedicated ChatGPT experience for under-18 users in September, with automatic redirection to age-appropriate content that blocks graphic and sexual material. It also said it was developing behavior-based age prediction technology that estimates whether a user is over or under 18 based on how they interact with ChatGPT. In a post on X, Sam Altman , the CEO of OpenAI, said that stricter guardrails on conversational AI to address mental health concerns had made its chatbot “less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems”. The stricter safety controls came after Adam Raine, a California teenager, died by suicide earlier this year, with his parents filing a lawsuit in August claiming ChatGPT provided him with specific advice on how to kill himself. Just two months later, Altman said the company has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues”. The US Federal Trade Commission had also launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI , over how AI chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion “Given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” Altman said Tuesday, arguing that OpenAI’s new safety tools now allow the company to ease restrictions while still addressing serious mental health risks.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/14/openai-chatgpt-adult-erotic-content,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8509a811ce07903e33ca86e3a3e0f15660d50e89/960_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9ed38a62087a7a05447efc52f9d82803",2025-10-14T21:50:53+00:00,81a142646f4807536f33bb0a9a2b60c3606f956c
44305f344748,A quiet bite in: Charlie Bigham launches £29.95 ready meals for home diners,,"B ritish consumers are looking to treat themselves with an alternative to dining out despite a squeeze on household finances, according to the food entrepreneur Charlie Bigham who is launching luxurious ready meals costing up to £29.95. The supermarket supplier is selling a new five-option range, which includes a venison bourguignon made with wild-caught venison from the Scottish Highlands, in an attempt to snare consumers saving on the cost of a night out. It puts the company in competition with cafes and restaurants, which have been forced to put up prices as costs such as labour, energy and tax soar. “If you go out to a restaurant or a gastropub or whatever, you might notice at the end of the meal that the bill seems to have crept up quite a lot,” says Bigham. He said Britons had become accustomed in recent decades to dining out regularly, whether it was a “date night” or “sitting down with someone else and having a good chat”. His idea is to “create the opportunity for people to do that at home with real top-notch food.” Bigham launched his eponymous food business from his kitchen table in 1996. The company is sold in supermarkets including Waitrose and Tesco, and its founder appears in its TV adverts in animated form . Charlie Bighams Brasserie beef wellington. The range, which has been a year in development, will initially launch in 70 Waitrose stores this week, with some meals costing triple the £9.95 typically charged for its bestselling fish pie. “It’s fairly and squarely aimed at that weekend occasion,” he said. “I can safely say that our food is better than a slightly soggy takeaway pizza and far more nutritious and far better for you.” He suggested the range, which also includes duck confit and salmon wellington filled with a sashimi-grade fillet, could be “spot on for some Christmas celebrations” and if the range is well received there could be more options on the way. Bigham said the squeeze on household budgets had been “slightly overstated” and certain consumers, who have had recent pay rises, had more money to spend. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has struggled to get the economy moving quickly this year, and consumers have faced rising grocery prices and high energy bills, putting pressure on spending. Bigham said: “We’re talking ourselves into everybody feeling poorer, and actually, the facts would suggest maybe otherwise.” Confit duck is also included in the five-option range. Speaking over video call from his colourful living room, Bigham said UK consumers were “waking up to the fact that making food cheaper has consequences” both for the environment and health. “Facing into these issues does cost a bit more but it’s worth it,” he said. “I’m not one of those doom and gloom merchants. I know awful things are happening in the world and we are in an unpredictable place but luckily we have the joy of food.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sales rose 8.8% to £144.3m in the year to 31 August 2024, when pre-tax profits rose more than a third to £7.7m. Shareholders led by Bigham himself paid themselves a £2.3m dividend, up from £2m a year earlier. In the year to the end of August 2025, growth has been stronger again with sales up more than 14%. “There’s still lots of people who’ve never tried our food. So we’re in the foothills,” Bigham said. In times of instability shoppers wanted value for money and that could take many forms, he added. Bigham was coy about whether the brand would have to put up prices again – amid rising meat, fish, labour and packaging costs, but said: “We hate putting prices up, because consumers don’t like it. However, if our costs go up, then we kind of have a choice: we can either … salami the quality off a bit and say, let’s scrimp and save, or we have to pass on those increases.” New taxes on packaging have hit the business, which uses eco-friendly wood-based cartons that are compostable rather than recyclable. However, he is supportive of the idea in general, saying businesses were thinking “very carefully” about how to use recyclable materials. On wider taxes, Bigham said businesses recognised Reeves had a financial hole that needed to be filled and the main fear before the 26 November budget was that the government “might choose the wrong taxes to put up”. Bigham, 58, is annoyed about changes to inheritance tax on family businesses. He said “these businesses are the engine of growth in the economy” and were facing a tax that does not apply to corporate equivalents.

9c7a1bbe7922,Panic as US federal workers scramble to find out if they’ve been fired: ‘I don’t have email access’,,"Federal workers are scrambling to figure out if they still have a job after the Trump administration launched a fresh wave of layoffs amid a federal government shutdown, prompting widespread confusion and panic. A hearing is scheduled to take place on Wednesday after labor unions sued to block the latest firings, setting the stage for another legal battle over Donald Trump ’s efforts to drastically cut back the federal workforce. About 4,200 federal employees across seven agencies were laid off on Friday, the administration has said, although 700 firings at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were swiftly reversed over the weekend. It remains unclear if Trump, who told reporters that “a lot” of government workers would be fired, plans to go further. The federal workforce has already shed hundreds of thousands of staff on his watch this year. As unions seek to establish the extent of the latest layoffs, workers at the Department of Education said that they do not have access to their work email accounts during the shutdown – so cannot check to see if they have received “reduction in force” (RIF) notices. A table showing the number of federal employees who received reduction in force notices as of 10 October “My co-worker in the office of special education programs was RIF’ed. She had access to her government email and found out,” an employee at the education department, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said. “The rest of us are in a panic. I think I may have been fired and I don’t have a way to find out. They sent the RIF notices to our official government emails which we don’t have access to.” Another education department employee said: “I don’t have email access due to the shutdown. Some have received permission to check. I have not.” They later were able to access their email, where they received an update to a reduction in force from earlier in the year that was halted by court challenges, with a revised separation date of 3 November. The first employee criticized the timing of the firings, which were conducted the day before the funeral of the office’s longtime division director, Greg Corr, who had recently retired after 38 years there. The majority of employees in the special education and rehabilitative services department, which houses the office of special education programs, were reported to have been fired as part of the reduction in force. A copy of a reduction in force notice at the education department seen by the Guardian claimed that “the continued lapse in funding” made it “necessary” to implement the layoffs and cited a separation date of 9 December. No previous government shutdowns have resulted in a reduction in force. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is special education.” The administration presented a reduction in force at the education department in March, but state attorneys general and unions sued to block the effort to dismantle it. A preliminary injunction to block those firings was granted by a federal court in May. The supreme court allowed the firings to proceed in a brief, unsigned order issued in July that provided no explanation, while the legal challenge to the closure of the department is ongoing in court. More than 4,100 employees worked at the education department when Trump took office. Between a previous reduction in force and these latest firings, staffing at the agency is now under 2,000. “This administration is using the same playbook that led to the termination of 1,500 staff in March to further illegally dismantle the Department of Education without any regard for the impacts on the American public, and we are tired of it,” said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE local 252, a union representing education department workers. Gittleman, an employee at the department herself, received a reduction in force notice in March. “These RIFs will double down on the harm to K-12 students, students with disabilities, first generation college students, low-income students, teachers and local education boards, which are already feeling the impacts of a hamstrung Department from the March RIF,” she said. The notices have increased anxiety and fear of other federal employees at agencies that have not been slated for cuts during the shutdown, where many workers are already either furloughed or working without pay. “Our staffing levels are pretty low, so it’s hard to comprehend how much more cuts are going to be made and who,” Imelda Avila-Thomas, president of AFGE local 2139, and a Department of Labor employee, said. Approximately 75% of staff at the department have been furloughed, but the agency has not enacted a reduction in force yet. “That chaos is so debilitating on everybody’s mental health, physical health and just in general it’s demoralizing,” she said. “Morale is already low, and then we have this happening. I don’t want to say anybody is safe, I think we all understand that’s not a thing.” The White House deferred comment to the office of management and budget, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Department of Education responded with an out of office message stating “due to the lapse in appropriations, we are currently in furlough status. We will respond to emails once government functions resume.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/trump-federal-workers-layoffs,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fda377ffcc66723bfbc1f28bff13bd5c7d1d920/333_0_3333_2668/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=296c5ec34acb43c9d77f268237eb9b02",2025-10-15T12:03:19+00:00,5bf9115eb0bdbafd910b00f3599637db9ffe8343
df2cabc3330b,The flood-prone Worcestershire town being abandoned by insurers,,"W alking through the centre of Tenbury Wells is like stepping into a postcard. The independent shops are painted in cheerful colours and flowers spill out of planters. Bunting festoons the lampposts, and the pubs are full, their steamed-up windows glowing orange. You would not know that just a few months ago, the Worcestershire town was a wreck, destroyed by flood water, with windows smashed and shops gutted. The inhabitants have worked hard to make it pristine again, a vision of the England seen on chocolate boxes and in Christmas films. But speak to the people who own the shops and you see the misery through the stiff upper lips. Insurers have abandoned Tenbury, which means one more flood could bankrupt the town. “One more flood and I’m leaving,” said florist Richard Sharman, whose shop on the corner of the high street was flooded four times last year. “I can’t get contents insurance, I can’t afford to rebuild if we flood again, and my lease is up at the end of December, so I just won’t renew it.” Sharman did up the shop in 2023, when he moved in. Soon, it could join the small but growing number of abandoned and derelict buildings on the high street. Climate breakdown is thought to be a driver behind the increasing frequency of severe flooding in Tenbury, which sits between the River Teme and the Kyre brook. Floods used to occur about once a decade. But now, deluges are an almost annual occurrence, having hit in 2019, 2020, 2023 and 2024. Despite potentially being the first English town to become uninsurable owing to floods , Tenbury is not going to be included in the government’s list of flood schemes. Labour said it would give £2.65bn for flood and coastal erosion risk management over two years to March 2026, but the town council has been informed that Tenbury did not make the cut. The Town council’s deputy mayor, Lesley Davies, left; the mayor, Robert Perrin, centre, and the town clerk, Lesley Bruton. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian “We do feel abandoned,” said Lesley Davies, the council’s deputy mayor. “We are the blueprint for what could happen in the future – there may be other towns are getting towards that situation, there are a lot of vulnerable towns on rivers all over. But I think we are the first to be in this situation.” The council owns three of Tenbury’s main buildings: the town hall, which doubles as a wedding venue; the art deco cinema; and a pavilion used for sports in the summer. All three are now uninsurable, which means when the next flood hits, the buildings could end up ruined for years, or even for good. The insurers said they would not be able to offer cover because the town faces “almost certain flooding” and there were no schemes planned to solve the problem. The Environment Agency had put together an intricate flood defence plan with a complex design, including flood walls, embankments and 20 flood gates. But the scheme was abandoned after the project costs ballooned to £30m. “We have no choice,” said Robert Perrin, Tenbury’s mayor. “We will have to be uninsured. And then if the buildings are damaged we will have to apply for grants, or crowdfund, to fix them. And that could take a very long time, during which they will be closed.” Not many small towns boast an art deco cinema like the Regal, which also puts on pantomimes, theatre shows and bingo nights. Last time it flooded, it was damaged to the tune of half a million, and is now uninsured, meaning it may not be able to be restored if the floods come again. Davies said: “The theatre company is a not for profit, and wouldn’t be financially viable if they had to pay a market rent on that building. So we subsidise it to allow these community events to happen. So if that building was closed due to flooding at any length of time, the Regal theatre company wouldn’t survive because they would have no revenue, and we wouldn’t be able to fund the repairs, unless we applied for grants, and that would take time. In reality, the theatre would shut down.” The same is true for the independent retailers, many of whom are preparing to pack up and leave. Either they cannot get insurance, or the premiums are unaffordable. Electrical appliances shop owner Andrew Bright. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian Andrew Bright has owned electrical shop G E Bright since he took over from his father in the 1980s. Situated in the middle of the high street, the shop was running a brisk trade on a Wednesday afternoon. But Bright is leaving. “We haven’t been able to get any flood insurance since 2020. We’ve moving out of the town centre – it’s just not feasible to stay any longer with all the floods,” he said. “We’ve bought some land just outside of Tenbury, and are setting up a shop and warehouse there.” Looking around ruefully, he said: “We’ve been on the high street since the 1950s. My dad set it up when he finished in the air force. It’s a shame leaving but my sons are in their 30s, they’re the third generation, so I needed to guarantee their future.” Despite the desperate situation for Tenbury, there is a defiant attitude in the town. The colourful flowers on the high street were planted last year after the floods by volunteers in an attempt to brighten up the town. After the streets had been swept and the shop windows repaired, Tenbury residents got out their trowels and filled planters and window boxes with a rainbow of blooms. It was a small gesture, but shows they thought their beautiful town, on the brink of abandonment, was still worth being proud of. Davies, who has lived in Tenbury for more than 40 years, said: “We have a huge army of volunteers, every time we flood, and we turn things around, everybody rolls their sleeves up and gets the sandbags out and waders on. We can clean everything up, but we can’t repair the buildings.” This article was amended on 14 October 2025.

20bf848ee48e,What does the end of free support for Windows 10 mean for its users?,,"Figures for September suggest four in 10 of those using Microsoft Windows worldwide were still using Windows 10 , despite the introduction of its successor, Windows 11, in 2021. What is happening to Windows 10? After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide standard free software updates, security fixes or technical assistance to Windows 10 PCs. This means computers running the software will still work but it will steadily become more vulnerable to viruses and malware as bugs and security holes are discovered. Microsoft says the more up-to-date system, Windows 11, “meets the current demands for heightened security by default”. What’s the risk? If Windows users do nothing, they could become particularly vulnerable to hackers who are attracted to wide-scale systemic weaknesses. The consumer group Which? warned that about 5 million British computer users plan to continue using devices running the software. Wherever in the world you are, by continuing to use Windows 10 you will put yourself at risk of cyber-attacks, data theft and scams. Criminals “are going to target people, they are going to exploit weaknesses and they are going to want to steal your data,” says Lisa Barber, the editor of Which? Tech magazine. How do I reduce the threat? The most straightforward move is to update to Windows 11 for free. If your PC is less than four years old it will probably be able to run Windows 11. To find out, check your computer specifications. The minimum specifications for Windows 11 are 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but computers also need a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM 2.0), which stores credentials in a secure chip, similar to all modern smartphones. Microsoft has a free tool to check whether a computer running Windows 10 will support Windows 11 and Which? has an online tool to check compatibility based on the processor in your computer. What if my computer lacks the necessary hardware to upgrade to Windows 11? Doing nothing could leave you vulnerable to malware and other security breaches. One option is to sign up for Microsoft’s one-year extended security update , which will ensure protection until 13 October 2026. That will give you another year to plan for the end of support and make alternative arrangements. Signing up is free if you log into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account to sync your settings, otherwise you will need to pay $30, plus tax, or redeem 1,000 reward points. Is there an alternative to Windows 11? Other computer operating systems can provide safe and secure use for PCs that cannot upgrade to Windows 11. One solution is to install Linux, which is a family of free operating systems that come in various flavours or “distributions”. Make sure you back up all your files to an external drive or similar safe storage, as replacing Windows is likely to wipe them or make them hard to access. One of the most popular and user-friendly versions of Linux is Canonical’s Ubuntu, which is free, open source and supported with security updates. You will need a USB flash drive to install it in place of Windows, but Canonical has a step-by-step guide you can follow . Bear in mind that while plenty of software supports Linux, not all Windows apps will have Linux versions. Alternatively, if most of what you need a computer for can be performed using a browser, Google offers a version of its lightweight ChromeOS that can be installed on a number of PCs for free. Check that your model is supported and then follow Google’s ChromeOS Flex installation guide . You will need a USB flash drive. Buy a new computer If your computer cannot install alternative software or you need Windows, then another alternative is simply to buy a new PC with Windows 11 and support. Many retailers operate trade-in schemes that take back your old computer for recycling and offer a small discount on new models. Alternatively, refurbished Windows 11 machines are widely available from various retailers, such as Currys , marketplaces such as Back Market and manufacturers, such as Dell for lower cost.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/14/what-does-the-end-of-free-support-for-windows-10-mean-for-its-users,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a48d53658f00aa075ebdb5fb4eb034bc14a59e/48_0_3559_2848/master/3559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc57bfa0d254d111bfc6d500b3121cf7",2025-10-14T04:00:16+00:00,0d50a7257016a00ce7a57f778839c8eb8058b127
e9bc091b35b1,‘It’s a big unknown’: California Democrat on Trump’s 100% tariff plan for foreign movies,,"Laura Friedman’s love affair with film started young, staying up late to watch old Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney flicks. “It definitely gave me big dreams and I moved to Hollywood to follow those dreams,” she recalls. Now that dream is out of reach for many. Los Angeles is losing its allure as film producers increasingly turn to cheaper locations in other countries. But after 20 years working in the movie industry, Friedman is now uniquely placed to save it after she swapped Hollywood for the halls of Congress in Washington DC. “I want upcoming generations to have that same ability to follow their dreams and to be creative, to be storytellers,” said the 58-year-old, who in January succeeded fellow Democrat Adam Schiff – himself once an aspiring screenwriter – in representing California’s 30th congressional district. “Unfortunately, we’re seeing less and less opportunities for people who are going into the creative industries in this country. These are exactly the kind of jobs that we should be supporting as a nation.” US film and television production has been hurt in recent years by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Incentive programs have lured producers away from California to states such as Georgia and New Mexico – as well as countries such as Canada and Britain. Donald Trump responded last month by claiming that movie production “has been stolen” from Hollywood and the US and promising to slap a 100% tax on movies made outside the country. It was unclear how these tariffs would operate since movies and TV shows can be transmitted digitally without going through ports. There was also bafflement over what it would mean for US movies filmed on foreign locations or what legal basis the president would claim for imposing the tariffs. Friedman, the only current member of the House of Representatives who has worked in the film industry, said by phone from Los Angeles that she was grateful Trump acknowledged the problem. But she added: “I am concerned about his suggestion of tariffs because primarily I’m very nervous that this will end up raising the prices for consumers on movie tickets and on streaming services, and that’s not something that the industry wants to see. It’s not something that I would like to experience as a viewer myself.” Trump has frequently called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” and made them his go-to solution for economic problems. He has zealously imposed them on physical items such as aluminium and steel, cars and trucks and kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. How they would apply to intellectual property such as films is far less certain, especially with both productions and audiences now so globalised. Friedman commented: “There are times where it’s perfectly legitimate for an American production to have to shoot scenes overseas because you may want to shoot on location in Paris or London because that’s where your story is taking you. “There’s a concern, if you shoot 90% of your film in a soundstage in Hollywood and need to pick up 10% on location, whether that means the entire film now would be subject to the 100% tariff.” Hollywood has taken a number of hits, from the pandemic, to strikes, to other film centers offering incentives to make movies elsewhere. Photograph: Constantine Soutiaguin/Alamy Then there is the question of what Trump would actually be tariffing. “Are you tariffing the budget of the film or are you tariffing it very time a consumer streams the movie or goes to the movie theater? Those of us here in Los Angeles that I’ve spoken to don’t understand how the tariff mechanism is supposed to work in this case, so it’s a big unknown.” Friedman recalls how she enjoyed Squid Game , a South Korean TV production that turned out to be a hit with US audiences via Netflix. “Does that mean that, if I was going to watch Squid Game, I’d have to pay extra money to Netflix? Or does Netflix have to pay double the amount of money to acquire that to pay a tariff? It doesn’t seem fair to penalise productions that were never going to be American-filmed productions to begin with.” Instead of Trump’s tariffs, Friedman argues in favour of a national film tax credit. Earlier this year funding for California’s own film tax credit was more than doubled to $750m to make it more competitive with other states. The congresswoman explained: “It would basically give some tax relief that you could put against your earnings to offset your cost of labor. It would encourage people to employ more workers on their crews because their ability to deduct from their taxes would be directly related to the number of employees that they had on the set.” For Friedman this is personal. Her grandfather owned cinemas in London and Scotland. She grew up in south Florida watching old Hollywood movies. Yet she went to college wanting to study astrophysics because she loved reading science fiction and watching Star Trek . “Then after one day of math class in college, I realised that I was actually not cut out to be a scientist, what I really liked when I was watching was Star Trek was the fiction part more than the science part.” Who would pay more for Squid Game under Trump’s tariff plan? Friedman says that’s far from clear. Photograph: Netflix/AP She switched to studying film and, immediately after college, got a job in New York where over four years she worked for various producers including HBO. Then she landed a position at Paramount in Los Angeles and embarked on a 20-year career, rising to become a vice-president of a production company. She was a credited producer on five feature films including It Takes Two , a romantic comedy starring Kirstie Alley, Steve Guttenberg and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Her company also worked on White Man’s Burden, a John Travolta vehicle for which her future husband worked as an editor, though their paths would not cross until later. But Hollywood, she says, is not quite how it looks on the silver screen. “Hollywood loves to make movies where they show what they want the rest of the world to think their life is like. My life was not so glamorous. “I certainly have gone to some movie premieres in my life at the Chinese Theatre and other places but I was a mid-level executive for the most part. I had a fine career but I certainly was never at the exalted levels of being the head of a studio. “One of the most fun and thrilling things is when you go on to a film set and see that movie magic in action. When you see the set design and artisans who put that all together, and you see people practising their craft at that very professional level, it definitely gives you renewed respect for the craftsmanship that goes into making film and television and how people devote their lives to this. That’s what I’m trying to retain and support here in Los Angeles.” Friedman’s switch to politics happened incrementally. Devoted to LA, she took on volunteer work in historic preservation for city landmarks such as the Cinerama Dome and Capitol Records Building . This led her to a city commission, then a city council, then the California state assembly and then last year’s election to the US Congress. She reflected: “It was step by step and I found that public service is even more fulfilling than I was experiencing in the film industry, although I still love that industry. I find politics to be very similar to film in a lot of ways. “It is about having a vision and building consensus around that vision and working with a team and figuring out what you need to do to get your project made. In film you don’t get paid unless the movie gets made and in politics there’s no reason to be there if you don’t get stuff done.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/laura-friedman-hollywood-trump-tariff-democrat,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78dd091ae236771cf66a9b5c5823d5f30528a1d/455_0_5914_4732/master/5914.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54a6cb49403ee53aba9ed427734bd868",2025-10-14T12:00:41+00:00,18038b3d5ff8a35d0a1213c94af400c2e05d4bd4
7a8f3c1616cc,Most of Great Britain’s major rail operators are back in public hands – is it working?,,"*Estimate based on contract expiry and government plans to nationalise every three months. Operator route maps are approximate The majority of Great Britain’s major rail operators are now in public ownership, as the Labour government continues its efforts to make the railways “more reliable, affordable and accessible”. The nationalisation of Greater Anglia on 12 October represents the ninth major passenger service to be brought back into public ownership, leaving seven to go before the government’s deadline of completing every operator by 2027. The rollout, which is resulting in an operator being nationalised roughly every three months, is gradually bringing an end to a privatised system that critics argue has been overly fragmented and focused on profit, to the detriment of passenger experience. Several operators were already under public ownership by the time Labour were elected in 2024, having been nationalised by the Conservatives over financial woes and poor performance. Meanwhile, Transport for Wales and ScotRail were each nationalised by the Welsh and Scottish devolved governments, in 2021 and 2022 respectively. However, under the current transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, the Department for Transport (DfT) has accelerated the pace of nationalisation, bringing three operators on to the public books since May: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia. State of play, October 2025 So far nine of the 16 major rail operators in Britain are now in public ownership: Tap an operator to highlight routes, tap again to deselect The government has said the remaining seven will be nationalised by October 2027 : The operator that was nationalised most recently was Greater Anglia , which took place on 12 October 2025 . The next operator set to be nationalised is West Midlands Trains , which the government says will take place in February 2026 . The nationalisations come ahead of the establishment of a new state-controlled company called Great British Railways, expected next year, which will manage rail infrastructure and services. It has been described by the DfT as a “single directing mind” for “bringing track and train together, putting passengers and customers first, [and] rebuilding trust in the railway”. It will soon manage most of the publicly owned operators in Great Britain, combining them with Network Rail, which owns the tracks, signals and big stations. However, Great Britain’s trains will remain privately owned. Industry insiders have expressed cautious optimism about Labour’s plans, highlighting the potential for Great British Railways to achieve more coordination and, in turn, greater efficiency. However, experts have also warned that nationalisation alone may not be enough to fix all of Britain’s problems with rail, given ballooning costs. “Irrespective of the ownership changes, the government’s got a major headache with the fact that rail is gobbling up so much public subsidy, and that’s before you get to HS2,” said Stephen Glaister, the emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London and a former chair of the Office of Rail and Road. “The government are making promises to make fares even cheaper and services even better, but both will cost more public money.” The data available on nationalised operators so far offers a mixed picture on performance. Several have experienced improving train punctuality and a reduction in cancellations but the performance of others has worsened over the past year. LNER has been one of the most improved – and in June the rail minister, Peter Hendy, described the operator as a “blueprint” for wider renationalisation efforts. Guardian graphic. Source: delay and cancellation data taken from the Office of Rail and Road. *Note: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia were nationalised by the Labour government in the latter half of the time period analysed here When will the next operators be nationalised? Labour committed to bringing rail into public ownership in the party’s 2024 election manifesto – claiming it had come up with a way to nationalise trains “without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation”. Instead of an “all-at-once” approach, nationalising every operator simultaneously and paying off shareholders, the government is running down the clock on existing rail contracts. The DfT is waiting for each operator’s core contract expiry date, which allows the government to take over without compensating the private companies. The final operator to expire in this way will be CrossCountry in October 2027 – and this is when the government says it will have completed rail nationalisation in Great Britain. Until then, the government has set a pace of nationalising one operator in each annual quarter. West Midlands Railway is due next, in February 2026. Labour’s current one-at-a-time approach builds off of the work of its predecessors in government. Several operators – including LNER, Northern and Southeastern – were brought into public ownership by the Conservatives from 2018 onwards. In those cases, nationalisation was taken as an emergency measure rather than a deliberate policy – in response to financial difficulties, in the case of LNER, or because of dismal performance, in the case of Northern. Additionally, ScotRail and Transport for Wales were brought into public ownership by their respective devolved governments, and their train operations are not expected to be merged into Great British Railways. Labour’s strategy for the remaining operators is driven by legal reality – which experts say could be helpful given how fragmented rail in Great Britain has become. “You can’t do it in one go,” said Marcus Mayers, the managing director of the Rail and Station Innovation Company. “If you try to merge 22 companies in one go – you don’t have the ability to build the system, to join it together that quickly. “So you build an operation which is capable of ingesting organisations, and is capable of ingesting organisations at the rate of one every three months. That makes sense.” Will nationalisation improve the railways? The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has previously said his government would not be nationalising rail out of ideology but because of what it could deliver for passengers. “We’ve tried privatisation for two or three decades and it’s a complete mess,” the Labour leader said in April 2024 . “Everybody who travels on the trains has been affected by the cancellations and delay.” Privatisation was undertaken by the Conservatives in the 1990s, after decades of falling ridership under the nationalised British Rail. From 1948 onwards the annual number of journeys on Britain’s rail network fell consistently, from a peak of more than 1 billion a year in 1950 to a low of 0.6 billion in 1982. After privatisation, rail journeys recovered significantly, reaching a new peak of 1.7 billion by 2017. Chart showing passenger journeys on Britain’s rail network between 1945 to 2025 “Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance,” said Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary under David Cameron, in a speech in 2013. However, the impact on other aspects of train travel has been more mixed. One of the original selling points of privatisation was that competition for franchises would bring better value for the taxpayer. While the industry remained subsidised overall, some major commuter franchises went on to pay a return. Yet in the past few years, after huge falls in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic, the amount the government pays to operators in public subsidy has ballooned to record levels. “The government is still forking out £12bn on operational subsidy, plus HS2 is another £7bn, plus extracurricular investment projects on the existing railways,” Glaister said. “That’s a very great deal of money in the context of the public expenditure crisis.” Costs have risen for passengers, too. Rail fares have become less affordable since privatisation, rising faster than average earnings in the same period. Today it costs about £8.90 to take a 50km (31-mile) journey by rail, based on how much revenue rail operators collect for each kilometre travelled on their network. When adjusting for inflation, that same journey would have cost £7.54 in 1994. Chart showing how rail fares have increased relative to wages since privatisation in 1995 The rising cost of rail comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the reliability of Great Britain’s trains. Last year was the worst year for cancellations nationally since 2015, according to statistics produced by the Office of Rail and Road . Labour has pledged to improve reliability and affordability with nationalisation, banking on a unified Great British Railways to end what critics see as an overly fragmented system. “It’s possible, because there’s efficiencies of integration of track and train, which might mean that problems get solved more quickly,” Mayers said. “You may be taking out the commercial imperative to drive reliability, but you’ve also got more collaboration about how to achieve it. So it’s a fine balance, and whether it will work or not is still open for debate.” Others are sceptical of how much more efficiency can be wrung out of the system. “Governments frequently say: ‘Oh, we’ll make the railways more efficient, we’ll buy lots of new equipment, we’ll employ less people to do the work,’” Glaister said. “But the industry has been trying to do that for years and years, and the regulators screw that down to the absolute bottom in their settlements. And I don’t think there’s a lot of, as it were, undiscovered efficiencies to go for.” A DfT spokesperson said: “Through public ownership and the creation of Great British Railways, the government is fundamentally reforming how our railways are run, putting passengers first. “Public ownership will deliver a railway that is more accountable, efficient, and reliable – resulting in greater opportunities for communities and significant growth. “It is not a silver bullet, and issues inherited from private sector ownership will take time to root out, but we expect public sector operators – and Great British Railways once it is established – to focus relentlessly on improving reliability, punctuality and other aspects of the service that matter most to passengers, and we will hold them to account for doing so.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2025/oct/13/most-of-great-britains-major-rail-operators-are-back-in-public-hands-is-it-working,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b462f9f4dd50ba732fe3733fdd2d6794f73cea/1_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a7cadaf94ccae7ad9376aac210974fd",2025-10-13T06:00:14+00:00,f3f17a166e01c941fd375efa8cca6ad7dcb14d4c
5080e55161a0,‘Lab to fab’: are promises of a graphene revolution finally coming true?,,"A fter graphene was first produced at the University of Manchester in 2004, it was hailed as a wonder material , stronger than steel but lighter than paper. But two decades on, not every UK graphene company has made the most of that potential. Some show promise but others are struggling. Extracted from graphite, commonly used in pencils, graphene is a latticed sheet of carbon one atom thick, and is highly effective at conducting heat and electricity. China is the world’s biggest producer, using it to try to get ahead in the global race to produce microchips and in sectors such as construction. In the UK, a graphene-enhanced, low-carbon concrete was laid at a Northumbrian Water site in July, developed by the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester and Cemex UK. “The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab,” says Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics, a startup spun out from the University of Cambridge that makes graphene-based photonic technology for datacentres. Jensen also invented Vantablack coatings, made of carbon nanotubes – rolled-up sheets of graphene – and known as the world’s “blackest black” because it absorbs 99.96% of light, at the UK company Surrey NanoSystems that he founded in 2007. The material’s artistic rights were sold exclusively to the sculptor Anish Kapoor , and BMW used it on its X6 coupe to create the “blackest black car” six years ago. An untitled Vantablack work by Anish Kapoor on display in Venice in 2022. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian “This is the challenge when you have new materials trying to displace an incumbent technology,” Jensen says. “The value proposition must be extremely good, but there also must be a way to manufacture the material and manufacture it at scale for the application … then you have to meet price expectations because there’s no point in delivering something that’s costing 10 times more than the incumbent.” Germany’s Bayer tried to produce carbon nanotube products in bulk but shut down its pilot factory more than a decade ago after the expected surge in demand failed to materialise. The material is now mainly used as a filler to strengthen plastic products. The company described the potential applications of nanotubes as “fragmented”. More promising are the graphene-based optical microchips developed by 2D Photonics’ subsidiary CamGraPhIC, which are based on research done at the University of Cambridge and Italy’s CNIT research institute. At the moment, silicon-photonics microchips convert electrical data into optical data to transmit it through fibre-optic cables, but the firm says its graphene chips deliver more data in the same period of time and at far lower cost. Single graphene crystals. Photograph: 2D Photonics They consume 80% less energy and can operate in a much wider range of temperatures, reducing the need for costly water- and energy-hungry cooling systems for AI datacentres. Sending data via silicon also causes delays. Jensen compares it to a 16-lane motorway that suddenly narrows to a single lane because of roadworks, forcing everything to slow down. Graphene photonics, he says, are like a motorway with hundreds of lanes. “What we’ve solved is the ability to grow consistent ultra high-performance graphene and to build it into a device,” he says. “And don’t forget, this is a material that’s one atom thick. It’s insanely difficult to do this.” Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics. Photograph: Ermanno Fissore CamGraPhIC was founded in 2018 by the Cambridge nanotechnology professor Andrea Ferrari, who also runs the Cambridge graphene centre, and Marco Romagnoli, who leads advanced photonics at CNIT in Pisa and is the startup’s chief scientific officer. Its parent, 2D Photonics, has just secured funding of £25m from backers including Italy’s sovereign wealth fund, Nato and Sony innovation funds, Bosch Ventures and the UK’s Frontier IP Group, and uses a former Pirelli photonics research site in Pisa. It plans to create a pilot manufacturing site in the Milan area to produce 200mm-wide wafers at scale, and is confident of obtaining the necessary funding of €317m (£276m) by the end of the year. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paragraf , a University of Cambridge spinout based in the nearby village of Somersham, has also fared well over the past decade with backing from the UK Treasury. It produces graphene-based electronic devices, including sensors for electric cars, and biosensors for the early detection of disease and other uses in healthcare and agriculture. It recently secured $55m (£41m) from investors including the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, which took a 12.8% stake in Paragraf. A more recent startup, Graphene Innovations Manchester, launched in 2021 by Vivek Koncherry, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia last December for the world’s first commercial production of graphene-enriched carbon fibre, used in construction for roofs and facades, as well as street light poles. It has started making it in Tabuk with a local partner, and says it is on track to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026. The 2D Photonics cleanroom at its development facility in Pisa. Photograph: 2D Photonics Other businesses, however, have found the going tougher. One of the sector’s first companies was Applied Graphene Materials, founded by Prof Karl Coleman in 2010 and spun out from Durham University . It launched a number of products including an anti-corrosion primer and a protective bike-detailing spray, which made it on to the shelves in Halfords. But the loss-making enterprise was wound down in 2023 and Canada’s Universal Matter acquired its main business. Ron Mertens, the owner of the website Graphene-Info, says: “As is true in the wider materials industry, things take a very long time to reach the market. Many graphene producers and developers never managed to generate meaningful revenues or become profitable.” The Gloucestershire-based Versarien grew from a garage startup in 2010. Supported by Innovate UK, a government agency, it has developed graphene powders and other products for use in sensors, low-carbon concrete, paints, inks for electronics and textiles such as Umbro running gear and prototype stealth materials for the US military. The Aim-listed company expanded into Spain and South Korea but ran into financial difficulties and was forced to place several subsidiaries in administration or voluntary liquidation in July. Versarien has been seeking to sell its assets, including its patent portfolio, and only has enough cash to keep going until the end of October. Depending on the deal, it may undertake a solvent liquidation of the company or become a cash shell. An investment deal with a Chinese partner collapsed after the UK government intervened to block any collaboration on technology.

927760f1af23,Widow of man conned out of pension savings to lose half the compensation to tax,,"The family of a deceased man, who was conned out of his retirement savings after investing in the Norton Motorcycles pension scam, is to lose almost half the subsequent compensation award because of a little-known tax rule. A long-running battle to win an award from the Fraud Compensation Fund (FCF) meant that Robert Dewar’s pension was not reimbursed until 2024, five years after his death at the age of 64. Dewar’s widow, Susan, had been expecting to inherit his pension tax free, as is typically the case when a spouse dies before the age of 75 . However, an obscure clause in HM Revenue and Customs rules means the transfer of the £114,000 owed will be taxed because it was made more than two years after death – leaving her facing a bill of about £50,000. The Dewars’ daughter, Sally Holmes, said: “Once Dad had moved his pension, to what was classified at the time as a legitimate scheme, there was nothing we could do about what happened. The only way we could get any recourse was via the Fraud Compensation Fund, which had to take a number of years and so guaranteed the tax charge. It was inevitable because of the way the system has been set up.” The news of the probable tax bill is another blow for a family that became one of the most vocal campaigners during a long struggle to win compensation for victims. The scandal began when more than 200 people fell victim to a “pensions liberation fraud” during 2012 and 2013 , when they were tricked into allowing about £11.5m to be transferred out of their existing retirement plans. Most of those funds were then transferred into three Norton pension schemes of which the company’s former owner Stuart Garner was a trustee. The funds subsequently vanished after being invested directly into the heritage motoring brand, which dates back to the 19th century and has boasted high-profile devotees including the revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara and the actor Keanu Reeves . In 2022, Garner pleaded guilty to illegally investing millions of pounds of people’s retirement savings into his own businesses. He received an eight-month prison sentence , suspended for two years. Garner has always insisted he was also a victim of the initial liberation fraud. The conviction represented a huge fall from grace for the entrepreneur, who had used Norton’s brand to secure himself a cameo role in the 2015 Bond film Spectre and travelled with a government trade mission to China on Theresa May’s jet when she was prime minister. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

6d1a0bb68a03,"Use trials, threaten to cancel: how to get a good deal on UK TV streaming services",,"Use free trials Many of the streaming services offer free trials, so you could sign up to one, binge-watch the shows everyone is talking about and then cancel before you are rolled over into a paid-for subscription. Read the terms and conditions very carefully to make sure you are not caught out. Amazon Prime has a 30-day free trial, allowing you to check out shows such as The Girlfriend. Apple TV+ is running a free seven-day trial – maybe enough time to work your way through The Morning Show or Severance – as is Hayu (“the home of reality TV”). Netflix does not currently offer free trials. Often you can only sign up once, but depending on the rules, if there are several people in the household, one person signing up after another may enable you to enjoy multiple trials with the same service. Toggle between services Many people are forking out for multiple TV streaming services then not watching much (or anything) on one of them every month. You’re never going to get value for money if you are trying to watch three or four services at the same time Andy Webb of Be Clever With Your Cash If that sounds like you, rotate your services to save cash. If you are on a rolling monthly contract, which most people are, you can bail out at any time, sign up again when there is a series you really do not want to miss, then jump ship once you have watched it. Andy Webb at the website Be Clever With Your Cash says: “You’re never going to get value for money if you are trying to watch three or four services at the same time. So pick one, binge it, then move on to the next.” Quite a few TV shows and films are duplicated across two or more services – for example, at the time of writing, the Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis was on Netflix and Amazon Prime. The JustWatch app and website can help you find where the content you want to watch is available. Watch more ads Some TV streaming services charge less for plans with adverts. Disney+ now costs £5.99 a month with ads, while you will pay £9.99 for the ad-free option. Netflix’s with-ads plan is also £5.99. Some plans charge more for “better” picture and sound quality and the number of screens your household can watch at the same time. But are you paying for more than you need? Get it free with something else Lloyds Bank’s Club Lloyds current account lets you choose a different free perk every year, one of which is a 12-month “standard with ads” Disney+ subscription. This account has a £5 monthly fee that is refunded as long as you pay in £2,000 or more each month, so for many paying in their salary, that means their Disney+ is free. Barclays has just launched a similar offer where you get an Apple TV+ subscription. Some streaming services, such as Disney+, charge less for plans with adverts. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Many mobile phone networks throw in cheap or free TV streaming. For example, if you are joining O2 or upgrading, you can get up to six months of Disney+ or Amazon Prime as your included “Extra”. EE has a number of offers where you can get at least three months of Apple TV+ thrown in. Apple TV+ is included free for three months when you buy an Apple device Meanwhile, Uber One, the ride-hailing app’s subscription service that usually costs £4.99 a month or £49.99 a year, sometimes throws in a free Disney+ subscription. Of course, many people buy Amazon Prime for fast-track delivery and exclusive shopping deals and then get the TV and movies, too. It costs £8.99 a month or £95 a year. Shar e subscriptions You can share your services – if the platform allows this, of course. “The biggest savings come from using multiuser plans, in my opinion,” says Hugo Cannon at CompareRock , a financial comparison platform. He highlights how Netflix Premium (£18.99 a month) allows a household to watch four devices at the same time, and you can add up to two extra users who do not live with you for £4.99 each a month with ads or £5.99 without. Disney+ lets you add extra members for either £4.99 or £5.99 a month. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ lets you share your subscription with up to five family members. Pick Now instead of Sky “If you’re only interested in, for example, watching Premier League football on Sky, you can save money by getting a Now subscription instead of a full Sky package,” says Alex King at the finance platform Generation Money . “With Now, you can get a subscription to a sports package via their app which gives you access to Sky’s Premier League football coverage without having a dish or box installed, and without being packaged up with other channels you don’t want,” he adds. If want to watch Premier League football you can save money by getting a Now subscription instead of a full Sky package. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters Pay annually If you are committed to a particular streaming service, paying for a year upfront (where available) can save you money. However, the saving is not always great, and you need to be very sure you are going to make full use of it. As of 30 September, the Disney+ standard plan costs £9.99 a month or £99.90 for a year, so committing to a year results in a fairly decent saving of £19.98. Amazon Prime is £8.99 a month or £95 for a year, so the saving there is £12.88. At £43.99, the annual price of the Paramount+ basic plan offers a 26% saving when compared with paying the regular £4.99 a month over the period of a year. Hayu also has an annual plan for £43.99 and a monthly one for £4.99. Now is offering a 50% saving when you sign up for 12 months’ access to Sky’s entertainment channels. You pay £4.99 a month, which is half the fully flexible monthly price of £9.99. For sports fans, Now is offering a six-month deal that lets you watch all 12 live Sky Sports channels for £28 a month – just shy of a 20% saving on the normal £34.99 a month. Get a student discount Many TV streaming services offer a student discount, either direct or via student discount websites such as UNiDAYS, TOTUM and Student Beans. Students can get free access to Apple TV+ when they sign up for the Apple Music student plan, where you get one month free and then pay a special rate of £5.99 a month (the standard individual rate is £10.99 a month). The three sites above all offer free Amazon Prime for six months followed by the lower student price of £4.49 a month. They also have various deals for Sky TV starting from £15 a month. Threaten to cancel You could start the cancellation process and see where it gets you. There is so much competition in the market, you are likely to be offered a retention deal, which can sometimes be 50% or more off for perhaps three or six months, says Dan Wilderness at the personal finance website the Financial Wilderness . If you have a TV licence, you can watch films and television series on iPlayer at no extra cost. Photograph: Nicholas.T Ansell/PA Ben Smye at the website Hotukdeals says Sky customers have talked on its forums about cutting their bills by more than 30% by cancelling existing subscriptions and waiting for retention offers. Webb says: “If you’re still paying for Sky TV, moving over to Now will save you a packet … My top trick is to go through the [Now] pass cancellation process each month. Most of the time you’ll be presented with a lower price – this month, I knocked a £34.99-a-month Sky Sports pass down to £20.” Cancel Do you actually need to pay for any streaming services? With so many series and films available for free on the BBC iPlayer (if you have a TV licence), Channel 4 , ITVX, STV Player and 5, you could take a “subscription break” and work your way through all the hot current shows, plus series such as Industry (iPlayer) and How to Get Away with Murder (Channel 4) that you never watched first time around. Channel 4’s service is particularly good for drama series and films. Often you have to register and sign in to use these services.

6cd1f5d67e9e,MG wants us to pay £500-plus to remedy rogue electric car,,"Our MG5 electric car became dangerously out of control, but MG won’t do anything about it. The car suffered a power system malfunction after we had used a charger at a motorway service station. It wouldn’t respond to any controls, including the off button, so we called the AA. The patrolman managed to get it started, then decided to give it a test drive. My family was on board as it was pouring . When he put the car into reverse, it shot forward and failed to stop when he applied the brake. It rammed into the AA van and its wheels began spinning and smoking as it tried to accelerate. We all managed to exit the car, and the patrolman eventually succeeded in turning it off from the outside. We were told it was not safe to drive. The AA arranged a transporter to take it to a dealership and paid for the repairs, which cost £2,500. The patrol van was also damaged. The dealer has investigated the fault, for which we are to be charged £500, but has found nothing. MG has closed the case, and insists we request a further investigation at our own expense. Six weeks on, the car is still with the dealership. We don’t want to drive it until we know it is safe, but can’t afford to keep paying for investigations. AB, East Lothian You are not the only MG owner whose car has seemingly gone rogue. One man was forced to drive his car into a police van after his brakes failed. I asked the AA to send me its technician report, which confirms that the car “surged forward” when put into reverse. It’s unsurprising that you are reluctant to get behind the wheel until you know what’s wrong and, since the car is still under warranty you are reluctant to throw your own money at the problem. MG Motor UK seems remarkably unperturbed given the harm that could be caused by an out-of-control EV. Although the dealership had recommended that MG’s technical department review the case and issue guidance, MG, instead, closed it. MG, when you complained, merely apologised for the “inconvenience”. It ignored my questions about whether the review requested by the dealer was conducted before the case was closed, and how many incidents involving power surges or loss it is aware of. However, it speedily commissioned another, more detailed, investigation of the vehicle and conducted a 25-mile test drive after using a range of public charging points. You were not charged for this test and will not now be billed for the previous one. It says: “MG treats all issues where a malfunction may have potentially occurred as a priority. No malfunctions with any of the relevant in-vehicle equipment, or the ability to charge the vehicle using various systems, were detected on the car. “MG, and the authorised dealership, having carefully examined the vehicle, have concluded that an error occurred not related to the car. We will continue to support the customer with information and advice.” This leaves you in a difficult position. Your car has been given a clean bill of health, but you have lost confidence in it.

0fa7a588303e,BA stalls over paying out £220 flight compensation,,"I booked a Tui river cruise package in Switzerland with flights provided by British Airways . On the day we were to return home, we discovered our flight had been cancelled. There were about 40 people affected. BA eventually booked us on to a flight leaving 36 hours later, but has refused to pay us the £220 compensation each due under EC regulations. It says adverse weather was to blame and is exempted from compensation rules. I requested a formal confirmation of the cancellation to submit to my travel insurer and, on that form, BA claims “operational reasons ” were the cause. Unlike adverse weather, this is not covered by the insurance policy. AC, Alfreton, Derbyshire This is outrageous behaviour from a company that once considered itself “the world’s favourite airline”. You can’t get compensation from BA because, it says, bad weather grounded the flight, and you can’t get compensation from the insurer because the airline claims it was an operational issue. The difference is critical. Airlines are obliged to pay set sums of compensation for delayed or cancelled flights under regulation EC 261/2004 . They can only get out of it if the disruption was caused by “extraordinary circumstances”. The regulation is vague on what these circumstances might be, but years of court rulings have honed the list down. Undefined “operational issues” would not be considered an excuse to avoid a payout; weather sometimes is, but only if it is exceptional and unexpected. So which was the cause? Both, says BA, hedging its bets. It claims bad weather that had disrupted previous flights had displaced crew, and that had had a knock-on effect on your journey. It ignored my questions about the whens, wheres and hows but that’s immaterial. “Knock-on” effects of bad weather are not an excuse to withhold compensation, according to the law firm Bott & Co . BA insisted it couldn’t comment further because, by then, your case was in the hands of its dispute resolution service, CEDR. This sounded to me like stalling tactics. I pointed this out and suddenly it stumped up. Since the money had to be prised out of it, I fear the other affected passengers may still be empty-handed.

15e60e347f3a,iPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinness,,"The iPhone Air is a technical and design marvel that asks: how much are you willing to give up for a lightweight and ultra-slender profile? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body. Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass. Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the £1,099 17 Pro models . The Air’s slim lines are slightly betrayed by the plateau and camera lens that protrude from the back, doubling the phone’s thickness to about 11.3mm, reminiscent of Google’s Pixel bar . Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Photos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17. The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic. The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on eSim . In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the iPhone 14 , but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air. The sides of the phone are only a little thicker than the buttons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Most of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere. Specifications Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU) RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm Weight: 165g A19 Pro chip The Air takes about 105 minutes to fully charge, hitting 60% in 35 minutes using a 20W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the iPhone 17 Pro , but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs. Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges. Qi2 or MagSafe magnetic wireless chargers, such as the Twelve South PowerBug , are likely to make living with the Air easier for quick top-ups during the day. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian On heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode. Sustainability The slender frame still contains a fairly easy-to-replace battery, which may be needed after about 1,000 charge cycles. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109 . Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349 . Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air a seven out of 10 for repairability . It contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The camera behaves the same as most iPhones, but the lack of ultrawide and telephoto options simplifies things a bit. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front. The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the 17 Pro , but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects. The iPhone Air’s zoom is pretty good in brighter scenes but loses detail on more distant subjects. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost iPhone 16e . The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window. Price The iPhone Air costs from £999 (€1,199/ $999 / A$1,799 ) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599 , iPhone 17 is £799 , iPhone 17 Pro is £1,099 , the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199 , the Google Pixel 10 costs £799 , the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is £899 and the Fairphone 6 sells for £499 . Verdict The iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera. The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin Galaxy S25 Edge , the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down. The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case. The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories. But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere. Pros: super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI. The iPhone Air is impressive, looking and feeling different to the rest of the iPhone line.

cfa495b02e6a,The gospel according to Peter Thiel: why the tech svengali is obsessed with the antichrist,,"Hello, and welcome to TechScape. For the past week, my brain has been marinating in billionaire Peter Thiel’s byzantine musings about the antichrist and Armageddon. At this point, I’m pickled. Why, you might ask, does it matter what a billionaire thinks about the antichrist? Good question! To help us understand, my colleagues Johana Bhuiyan , Dara Kerr and Nick Robins-Early have reported on a series of talks given by billionaire political svengali and tech investor Thiel: Over the past month, Thiel has hosted four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a “small-o Orthodox Christian”, believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley and the US. Thiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest of Silicon Valley took a rightward turn with Donald Trump’s second term as president. He’s had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, is credited with catapulting JD Vance into the office of vice-president, and is bankrolling Republicans’ 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund. Palantir, which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the NHS in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology. “I’m a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I’m worried about the antichrist,” Thiel said during his third lecture. Thiel’s talks … were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinks Bill Gates is “a very, very awful person”. Read more: Inside tech billionaire Peter Thiel’s off-the-record lectures about the antichrist First, these revelations are so sensational, and that makes it fun to read about. How odd that a man worth some $20bn is giving meandering lectures that make him sound like a confused graduate student. But that’s not enough to make this a story. Journalists encounter all sorts of strange things that we don’t write about. When I was neck-deep in editing our story on Thiel’s lectures, which includes large amounts of quoted text, I worried that the Guardian ran the risk of promoting his ideas more so than informing our readers. The line between the two can be thin. Trump reporters have had to walk it for the better part of a decade now. One reporter who has covered Thiel extensively speculated that the lectures were a a way to present himself as a “zany contrarian” as he seeks to raise money. There could be self-interested reasons for lecturing about the antichrist concealed. ‘Worried about the antichrist’ … Peter Thiel. Illustration: Guardian Design/Getty Images Thiel said in one lecture: “It’s a pretty good marketing shtick if you want everybody to hear about something not to let anybody in the room.” This suggests that marking these lectures as off-the-record would draw outsized interest. It’s true that clandestine ideas, by virtue of their ostensible secrecy, attract prurient attention. What happens behind closed doors is more interesting than what’s in public. Were we falling into Thiel’s hands by covering his talks? Our approach to reporting on this was two-pronged. One story – which I mention and link to above – reports the facts of the talks. Thiel hosted these lectures and said these things. The story quotes him extensively. We included this note in the story: “ The Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors.” The reasoning behind that approach is this: you can read what this wacky billionaire has to say, and you can judge it compelling or lacking. Once informed, you may hold him accountable. Do you feel comfortable that this person has a great deal of sway over your vice-president if you’re in the US or your healthcare system if you’re in the UK? With Trump, it can be maximally informative to see his words as he said them. Reporting that the president’s words were “shocking” or “unprecedented” without including them can shield the reader from feeling astonishment at what he said, and may even inspire a backlash against a media outlet that comes off as parochial and paternalistic. Let the reader see and let them judge. On the opposite side of the same coin, reprinting the president’s rambling, two-hour speeches in their entirety is not always helpful to readers. It is one function of journalism to ingest, systematize and condense information, so a reporter must listen to the full speech and pick out the most relevant, representative parts. We approached Thiel’s lectures with these lessons from political journalism in mind. Our second piece on the topic – Peter Thiel’s off-the-record antichrist lectures reveal more about him than Armageddon , which published simultaneously with the first – took a different tack. This essay offered an interpretation of Thiel’s lectures without quoting him extensively, engaging with his ideas on behalf of the reader to decipher the significance of his words. His almost nonsensical interpretation of The Book of Revelation and other texts may be the apparent subject of the lectures, but their real meat – what he truly exposes about himself – is how a very influential person thinks about his power. In this critique of Thiel’s lectures, the Stanford professor Adrian Daub bushwhacked through the venture capitalist’s “bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations”, also known as “the autodidact’s private cosmos”. In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown. Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks, helped return a sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxxed, deported, drone struck. Who funds far-right movements that seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy. One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. ‘Ain’t you?’ Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is?

Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/EPA Australia’s distaste over social media has spread to Denmark. From my colleague Miranda Bryant : “The Danish prime minister says the country will ban social media for under-15s, as she accused mobile phones and social networks of ‘stealing our children’s childhood’. Mette Frederiksen used her speech on Tuesday at the opening of Folketing, the Danish parliament, to announce the proposal, in which she said: ‘We have unleashed a monster.’ She added: ‘Never before have so many children and young people suffered from anxiety and depression.’” Frederiksen hopes the ban will take effect next year. The rationale of teen suffering bears echoes of Jonathan Haidt’s panicked bestseller The Anxious Generation, which I found neither persuasive nor compelling . In November 2024, Australia passed a law requiring social networks to take stringent care not to allow children under 16 to create accounts. The prohibition has been plagued by uncertainty and confusion over age verification, but it is still slated to go into effect on 10 December of this year, much to the chagrin of Meta Platforms, Inc and others. The legislation’s survival, uncharacteristic of a law that reins in social media companies, has inspired similar bills around the world. Dozens of state governments in the US have now passed laws that require social networks and other websites to verify the ages of their users. Pornography sites have gone dark in many of those states over the demand to determine users’ ages.

2f3a69c42a8f,"Instagram to bring in version of PG-13 system to protect children, says Meta",,"Instagram is to adopt a version of the PG-13 cinema rating system to give parents stronger controls over their teenagers’ use of the social media platform. Instagram, which is run by Meta , will start applying rules similar to the US “parental guidance” movie rating – first introduced 41 years ago – to all material on Instagram’s teen accounts. It means users aged under 18 will automatically be placed into the 13+ setting. They will be able to opt out only with their parents’ permission. While the teen accounts already hide or prohibit the recommendation of sexually suggestive content, graphic or disturbing images, and adult content such as tobacco or alcohol, the new PG-13 version will tighten restrictions further. Meta said it would hide or not recommend posts with strong language, certain risky stunts, and content that might encourage “harmful” behaviours, such as posts showing marijuana paraphernalia. It will also block search terms, such as “alcohol” or “gore”, even if they are misspelled. “While of course there are differences between movies and social media, we made these changes so teens’ experience in the 13+ setting feels closer to the Instagram equivalent of watching a PG-13 movie,” Meta said, adding that it wanted to alight its policies “with an independent standard that parents are familiar with”. The closest UK cinema rating to PG-13 is 12A. In the same way as PG-13/12A films such as Titanic include fleeting, but not directly sexual, nudity, the new Instagram rating will not completely prohibit nudity. Neither will it block moderate violence of the kind in The Fast and the Furious, also PG-13/12A. The move comes after independent research involving a former Meta whistleblower claimed that two-thirds (64%) of new safety tools on Instagram were ineffective. The review was led by Arturo Béjar, a former senior engineer at Meta, as well as New York University and Northeastern University academics and the UK’s Molly Rose Foundation, among others. Béjar concluded: “Kids are not safe on Instagram.” Meta rejected the report’s findings and said parents had robust tools at their fingertips. The UK communications regulator, Ofcom, has also demanded social media companies take “a safety-first approach” and said sites that don’t comply should expect to face enforcement action. The Instagram updates would start in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada and will come to Europe and the rest of the world early next year, Meta said. Campaigners voiced doubt the changes would guarantee safety improvements. Rowan Ferguson, policy manager at the Molly Rose Foundation, said: “Time and again Meta’s PR announcements do not result in meaningful safety updates for teens and as our recent report revealed they still have work to do to protect them from the most harmful content. “These further updates must be judged on their effectiveness and that requires transparency from Meta to allow independent testing of their safety features.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/14/instagram-parental-guidance-pg-13-age-rating-system-meta,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b2d9e5704aa4cc63dbc19f3e9679f9ee8501778/246_0_3030_2423/master/3030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=828d590566e3ce05e9085779ed5f72ef",2025-10-14T10:00:38+00:00,175f7e6ade99f764c73bb9357d1458ce8f22eb33
6bdffd6f9a12,Equity threatens mass direct action over use of actors’ images in AI content,,"The performing arts union Equity has threatened mass direct action over tech and entertainment companies’ use of its members’ likenesses, images and voices in AI content without permission. The warning came as the union said growing numbers of its members had made complaints about infringements of their copyright and misuse of their personal data in AI material. Its general secretary, Paul W Fleming, said it planned to coordinate data requests en masse to companies to force them to disclose whether they used members’ data in AI-generated material without consent. Last week the union confirmed its was supporting a Scottish actor who believes her image was used in the creation of the “AI actor” Tilly Norwood, which has been widely condemned by the film industry. Briony Monroe, 28, from East Renfrewshire, said she believed that an image of her face had been used to make the digital character, created by the AI “talent studio” Xicoia, which has denied her claims. Most of the complaints Equity has received from members concerned AI-generated voice replicas. Fleming said the union has already helped members make subject access requests to producers and tech companies which failed to provide satisfactory explanations about where the data they used to create AI content came from. He said: “The companies actually became very willing to start discussing compensation and usage. So the industry needs to be more careful because it’s not going to stop there. “AI companies need to know that we will be putting in these subject access requests en masse. They have a statutory obligation to respond. If an individual member reasonably believes that their data is being used without their consent, we want to find out.” Fleming said he hoped the tactic would push tech companies and producers resistant to being transparent about the sources of their AI content to strike an agreement on performers’ rights. “What we’re trying to do is use people’s individual rights to make it so hard for tech companies and producers to not enter into collective rights,” said Fleming. As the union has 50,000 members, significant numbers of them making subject access requests would create a “hassle” for firms unwilling to negotiate, he added. Under data protection law, individuals have the right to ask for all the information an organisation holds about them. Organisations normally have one month to reply to a subject access request. “It’s not a silver bullet,” Fleming added. “It’s not easy to do because they may well have got data from somewhere else. A lot of people are behaving very recklessly and immorally.” Monroe said she believed that Norwood had copied both her image and her mannerisms. Monroe said: “I move my head quite a lot when I’m acting. I noticed in the last few seconds of Tilly’s show reel, that is exactly what she did. Other people have also said, ‘Those are your mannerisms. That’s how you act.’” Liam Budd, industrial official for recorded media at Equity UK, said the union was taking Monroe’s concerns seriously. The AI production company Particle6, which launched Xicoia earlier this month, confirmed it was working with the union “to address any concerns”. A spokesperson for Particle6 added: “Briony Monroe’s likeness, image, voice or personal data have not been used in any way to create Tilly Norwood. “Tilly was developed entirely from scratch using original creative design. We do not and will not use any performer’s likeness without explicit consent and fair compensation.” Although he would not comment on Monroe’s complaint, Budd said: “We’ve had increasing numbers of members getting in touch about specific infringements where they believe that their image or voice has been used without their consent to then create an output which can identify them or resembles them in some way. “It’s been a lot more common in the audio space because the technology is much easier. You don’t need many recordings to create a digital replica of a voice.” But Norwood represented a new challenge for the industry, said Budd, because “we haven’t really seen the launch of a wholly synthetic actor” before. Equity UK has been in negotiations with the UK production trade body Pact (Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television) about AI, copyright and data protection for more than a year. Fleming said: “The bosses are not asking questions about where this data has come from. Privately, they will admit that it is impossible to ethically use AI because it has been scraped and trained on data where the provenance is at best unclear. “But nine times out of 10, we know it’s been used completely outside of the existing copyright and data protection framework.” Max Rumney, the deputy chief executive of Pact, said its members needed to use AI technology in production or they would be at a commercial disadvantage to those firms with no collective agreements with unions, who did not remunerate actors, writers and other creatives. But he added that there was no transparency from tech companies on what content or data had been used to train foundation models, the technology that underpins AI tools such as image generators. “The foundational models have been trained without permission on the films and programmes of our members,” said Rumney. “Our members want human creative expression in their films and programmes. They value this and consider that this is what makes UK productions so compelling and innovative.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/13/equity-threatens-mass-direct-action-over-use-of-actors-images-in-ai-content,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f351605d5413404fe43ac94d688bebc2d7e130/0_0_1614_1291/master/1614.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30ddf84f0b8e8036ba238c8a7b18d8ba",2025-10-13T15:21:47+00:00,af33c0ea859f26a9cf4460e5419ad3868bed0f14

However, with that in mind, may I recommend a new show called Space Live? There’s only one episode. The only potential downside is that the episode literally lasts for ever. Actually, that’s inaccurate. Space Live isn’t a show, it’s a channel. It launched on Wednesday morning, tucked away on ITVX, and consists only of live footage of Earth broadcast from the International Space Station . It’s beguiling to watch, especially for anyone who didn’t realise that a person can be awestruck and bored simultaneously. It’s billed as a world first. ITV has partnered with British space media company Sen to use live 4K footage from its proprietary SpaceTV-1 video camera system, mounted on the International Space Station, giving us three camera views: one of the station’s docking ports, a horizon view able to show sunrises and storms, and a camera pointing straight down as the ISS passes across the planet. A tracker in the corner of the screen shows the live location of the ISS, while a real-time AI information feed provides facts about our geography and weather systems. Space Live’s footage is a significant improvement on Nasa’s. Photograph: ITV Of course, if you wanted to be picky, you could argue it isn’t exactly new. Nasa’s YouTube channel has been streaming live footage from the ISS for years, and uniformly draws an audience of a few thousand. But Space Live is, if nothing else, slightly snazzier. The footage is certainly nicer: at 8.30am on Wednesday, Space Live showed gorgeous images of the sun’s glare bouncing off the sea around the Bay of Biscay, while all Nasa could offer was a piece of cloth with the word “Flap” written on it. There’s even a soundtrack, a constant, soothing kind of hold music that loops and loops without ever becoming fully annoying. It’s an improvement, in other words. And, at least for the first orbit, it is absolutely spellbinding. While not quite offering the overview effect – the cognitive shift felt by those who see Earth from space, leading to new perspectives about humanity and its place in the universe – it is still extremely humbling to see just how small the planet is. The time it took for the ISS to pass from south-east England (where I am) to war-ravaged Ukraine could be counted in seconds. And then on, over Asia towards Australia. There really is very little separating us at all. Inevitably, as the station crosses the Earth, drifting endlessly between sunrise and sunset, your thoughts shift towards people you know from wherever it happens to be. There’s something palpably comforting about that. However, God knows you can’t be awestruck for ever. And so it is with Space Live. Eventually the magic of the technology and the perspective and the beauty of our planet starts to wear off, and the experience becomes something akin to the map you end up staring at on a flight when you’ve run out of films to watch. Your attention starts to stray, and you realise that ITVX has other live channels to watch. One of them just shows Love Island. Another just shows Christmas films. And then you realise, with a slump, that the majesty of the only home we’ll ever know spinning silently in space has become just another content option, along with whichever ITV channel shows American Ninja Warrior Junior. The views are simultaneously awe-inspiring and comforting. Photograph: ITV But even though you won’t watch it all the time, it’s nice to know that Space Live is there. It isn’t the sort of thing you’d imagine they’d stick on the big screen in pubs – not unless people really start getting into going “Weeeeeey” every time they see the Ural River – but as something to have on in the background, it’s undeniably soothing. My guess is, for a dedicated few, the channel will be something they’ll keep on silently as they go about their day. And, sure, that might not be why humanity first chose to embark upon the miraculous achievement of escaping the surly bonds of Earth – you’ll remember that Neil Armstrong pointedly did not say, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for the screensaver industry” – but, as an idea, Space Live can’t be faulted. I might not have it on all the time but, whenever I need to be reminded of who we are and how little separates us, I guarantee it will be my first port of call.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/15/space-live-new-tv-channel-real-time-broadcast-international-space-station-itvx,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b9ebe765e1274f691495b3e7886d73bd342019/1140_0_2700_2160/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=478c3f7aecafec78b134d71852a53201",2025-10-15T11:29:26+00:00,6635d1886e36fdef5737c7119e8194506c1a885e
8a3b702287f0,"The nine best electric blankets and heated throws, tried and tested to keep you toasty for less",,"A side from hugging a fluffy hot-water bottle, sipping the Christmas whisky and ramping up the thermostat, an electric blanket or heated throw is the best way to ward off the winter chill. More than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goes on heating and hot water , so finding alternative ways to keep warm – and heating the person, rather than the whole home – is always a good idea. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 3p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits. While electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa. They’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton. The most convenient electric blankets also have timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy. I was tasked with sleeping on the job to find out which was best, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown, Fogarty and Dreams. Here are my top nine picks. At a glance Double, £60 at Dunelm King, £30.59 at Amazon King, £139.99 at Boots £84.99 at Amazon £32 at Dunelm King, £199.99 at John Lewis Why you should trust me I’ve been a lifestyle journalist for magazines and newspapers for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve thoroughly tested everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully not all at the same time. Lately, I’ve specialised in bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen, so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step. Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon. How I tested I used an infrared thermometer to determine how fast the blankets warmed up – and how evenly. Photograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian Without a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 13 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how luxurious each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and how durable and well-made they were. After all, you want a blanket to feel comfortable and soft to the touch, which you can only really test by using them in real life. I measured how hot each blanket got and how quickly – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I tested the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. The weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, so I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C. No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I measured how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on the Ofgem price cap of 26.35p a kWh. Although I tested 13 electric blankets and heated throws, I’ve included only the best-performing designs here. Some brands didn’t want the products I had tested returned, so these will be donated to Hope for Food – a Bournemouth-based charity supporting local families in need. The best electric blankets and heated throws in 2025 Best electric blanket overall: Fogarty Wonderfully Warm Photograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian Double, £60 at Dunelm This Fogarty blanket has a generous nine heat settings and a one- to nine-hour timer. The soft fleece cover has a thermally bonded fibre wadding filling, giving it a plush feel, and its cushioned surface adds an extra layer of comfort. Why we love it Dual controls mean it’s easy to adjust the temperature on each side of the bed independently. You can have both sides on the same setting, one side on and the other off, or both sides set at different temperatures – so that’s one less thing to argue about with your other half. Heating up the king-size I was testing left this is as this is what she tested and all the timings etc took a little longer than anticipated, but my bed felt comfortably warm after an hour. The maximum setting was more than hot enough, so I opted for a cooler setting for an hour before bed. I like that this blanket has a nine-hour timer so that you can set and forget it. It’s a shame that … the sides of the blanket don’t heat up as effectively as the middle. Sizes available: single , double, king (currently unavailable) Dimensions (double): L150cm x W120cm Number of heat settings: nine Timer included: yes, one to nine hours Running cost on maximum (king size): 2p/hour (0.056kWh) Temperature after an hour: 27.1C Guarantee: two years Machine washable: yes Best budget electric blanket: Slumberdown Sleepy Nights King, £32.27 at Debenhams King, £30.59 at Amazon Generous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine-washed for easy maintenance and has a two-year guarantee. Why we love it This microfibre blanket feels soft against the skin and was simple to set up – bonus points were awarded for the long cord that could easily reach the nearest plug socket. The blanket’s fitted straps are lengthy and elasticated, so I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position it securely, plus it stayed in place nicely. The blanket is powerful, too, heating up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me. When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat. It’s a shame that … it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night. Sizes available: small single , single , small double , double , king, super king Dimensions ( king size): L150 x W142cm Number of heat settings: three Timer included: no Running cost on maximum : 3p/hour (0.094kWh) Temperature after an hour: 29.5C Guarantee: two years Machine washable: yes Best quilted electric blanket: Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket King, £139.99 at Boots King, £139.99 at Amazon The king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours. Why we love it The blanket heated up surprisingly quickly, reaching 22C in its centre after just 10 minutes. Within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. The middle and end of the blanket get hot, but the top section remains cool to the touch, working well for under your head. It costs a little more than your average electric blanket, but I love the high-end quilted bamboo finish. It has a polyester filling (as with many other electric blankets), but the bamboo fabric feels soft and has the natural benefit of being breathable. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, too, even when I was sleepy-eyed. It’s a shame that … there are no timer options between three and nine hours. Sizes available: single , double , king, super king Dimensions ( king size): L200 x W150cm Number of heat settings: six Timer included: yes, one, three or nine hours Running cost on maximum : 3p/hour (0.129kWh) Temperature after an hour: 32.2C Guarantee: three years Machine washable: yes Best heated throw overall: Beurer heated snuggle blanket Photograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian £109 at Currys £84.99 at Amazon Ideal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has a very soft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in a smaller 180 x 130cm size . Why we love it The surface of this heated blanket is wonderfully soft to touch, so it was easy to get cosy underneath it while on the sofa watching Strictly. Its structure feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets. The blanket heated up fast: it reached temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes, yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was a more comfortable heat. I like that you can switch on this blanket and forget about it, thanks to its three-hour automatic switch-off timer. It’s a shame that … it didn’t heat up as evenly as I would have liked. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all. That may create a problem if the person beside you on the sofa is trying to hog the blanket. Sizes available: small, large Dimensions (large): L200 x W150cm Number of heat settings: six Timer included: three-hour automatic switch-off Running cost on maximum : 2p/hour (0.055kWh) Temperature after an hour: 32.2C Guarantee: three years Machine washable: yes skip past newsletter promotion Get the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

A handheld digital LED controller allows you to flick between its six heat levels. Why we love it For less than £35, this heated throw is good value – and at this price, you could even buy it as a gift for friends or family. The deep navy colour looks great on my sofa, and the blanket feels lovely to touch. While it’s not the fluffiest heated throw I’ve tested, I like that it’s not too thick or heavy. Its size is perfect for one person – and will just about squeeze two people if you’re willing to snuggle up close. The blanket warmed up steadily, and the temperature it reached was comfortable. After 10 minutes on its full heat setting, I measured it at 19.7C in its centre. After an hour on full power, the blanket rose to 40.3C. The heat wasn’t particularly evenly distributed, but that didn’t make much difference to the overall feeling of warmth the blanket provided. It’s a shame that … it doesn’t have a timer, other than a four-hour automatic shut-off, but you’ll need to make sure you switch it off using the controller and at the plug after use. Sizes available: one Dimensions: L130 x W160cm Number of heat settings: six Timer included: no, but automatic shut-off after four hours Running cost on maximum: 3p/hour (0.1kWh) Temperature after an hour: 40.3C Guarantee: one year Machine washable: yes Best heated duvet: Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet King, £199.99 at John Lewis King, £199.99 at Amazon Dreamland has such a wide range of heated bedding products available that it’s hard to choose which one to go for (I also have my eye on the brand’s electric heat pads for specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands). Having tried the underblanket (as reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet compares. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable once the controller has been removed, so it’s easy to keep clean, and it can also be tumble dried. Why we love it I was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed under a breathable cotton Nectar duvet cover . The dual controls lead out the end of the duvet so that you can run them up the side of the bed to plug in. This means your duvet cover can be buttoned up, but you won’t be able to use one with a zip. The duvet is meant to heat up in five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. I like that it doesn’t get scorching hot too quickly, though. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature in the middle at 26.6C, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable but probably isn’t a heat I’d like to sleep with all night (as with all electric bedding, it’s advisable to turn it off at the plug once you’ve used it anyway). Each side can be heated independently, thanks to the dual controls. This worked well for my partner and me, meaning I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all. The duvet has a timer for up to nine hours, but I’d be inclined to put it on for an hour, just to take off the winter chill, and then turn it off for the duration of the night. It’s a shame that … it doesn’t come with a cover included in the pack. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy, on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath. Sizes available: single , double , king size Dimensions (king size): L225 x W220cm Number of heat settings: six Timer included: yes, one, three and nine hours Running cost on maximum: 5p/hour (0.101kWh a side) Temperature after an hour: 36.3C Guarantee: two years Machine washable: yes The best of the rest ‘Good for transitional seasons when you don’t want anything too heavy’: the Silentnight luxury heated throw. Photograph: Emily Peck/The Guardian Snuggledown Intelligent Warmth King, £125 at John Lewis King, £125 at Argos Best for: couples who share a bed and can’t agree on temperature With a sustainable 180-thread-count pure cotton cover, the surface of this electric blanket is luxuriously soft and breathable, wicking away moisture to keep it feeling fresh. The quilted finish added extra padding and warmth to my mattress before the blanket was even turned on. It has fastening straps for the corners, and the blanket’s base material sat securely without sliding around too much. The two control panels let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body. On the highest setting, the blanket produced a nicely even temperature that felt even warmer once I added my duvet. It didn’t make the final cut because … it may have a pure cotton cover, but its filling is made from polyester. Sizes available: single , double , king, super king ; dimensions ( king size): L200 x W150cm; number of heat settings: nine; timer included: yes, up to nine hours; running cost on maximum: 2p/hour (0.062kWh); temperature after an hour: 27.6C; guarantee: two years; machine washable: yes Dreams Luxury quilted heated blanket King, £40 at Dreams Best for: those with allergies There’s much to like about this electric blanket, from its pure cotton, smooth quilted finish to its independent dual control panels. What sets it apart from the rest is that it comes with an anti-allergy coating, which is reassuring because I’m allergic to dust mites. Each control panel has a timer that can be set to switch off after up to nine hours, but it heats up incredibly quickly, so I found that one hour of heat was more than enough at bedtime. You can control each quarter of the blanket independently, as with the Snuggledown above. It didn’t make the final cut because … it didn’t heat up as evenly as I’d like, although it felt fine with my duvet on top. Sizes available: double , king; dimensions ( king size): L200 x W150cm; number of heat settings: nine; timer included: yes, up to nine hours; running cost on maximum : 2p/hour (0.064kWh); temperature after an hour: 29.3C; guarantee: one year; machine washable: yes Silentnight luxury heated throw £45 at Silentnight £44.99 at Amazon Best for: smaller sofas and people who don’t want to share A simple control panel adjusts this heated throw, which has nine heat settings. It also heats up quickly and reached just over 33C after an hour. There’s no timer, but it turns off automatically after two hours, which should be more than enough to warm you up. The throw is quite thin and light, so it would be good for transitional seasons when the weather is a little warmer and you don’t want anything too heavy. The box says it costs 1p an hour to run on the lowest setting, which sounds about right – I measured it as 3p an hour on maximum. It didn’t make the final cut because … it’s quite thin, meaning you can feel the wiring inside. Sizes available: one; dimensions: L160 x W120cm; number of heat settings: nine; timer included: no, but two-hour automatic shut-off; running cost on maximum : 3p/hour (0.102kWh); temperature after an hour: 33.6C; guarantee: three years; machine washable: yes What you need to know How much do electric blankets cost to run? The average king-size electric blanket cost 3p an hour to run in my tests. If used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course. “There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert at Love Energy Savings . “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.” How much should you spend on an electric blanket? Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. You can expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw. Are electric blankets safe? Electric blankets should be used with caution, and should never be used by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend that young children use electric blankets unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Brands don’t always seem to make it obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Safety marks such as “ BEAB approved ” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “ KEMA-KEUR safety tested” should offer peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety, read this advice from London fire brigade . Also look out for safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that you can set to stay on for a number of hours before it turns off, or overheat protection that switches off the device if it senses it is getting too hot. An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, just underneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed. Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress? Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but they can potentially damage some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser at Opera Beds . “Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures to face this issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.” Emily Peck is a lifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than two decades.

11ba0f52575a,Apple iPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoom,,"T he 17 Pro is Apple’s biggest redesign of the iPhone in years, chucking out the old titanium sides and all-glass backs for a new aluminium unibody design, a huge full-width camera lump on the back and some bolder colours. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage. From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year. Higher peak brightness and a new anti-glare coating on the screen help cut down on reflections in bright light, making it easier to use outside. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset. A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel . The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau , so a case is still prudent. The home and lock screens of iOS 26 now have a glassy, more rounded look to text and icons. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer. It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold. The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use. Sustainability The camera plateau stops the iPhone 17 Pro rocking around on a desk as much as previous models. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109 . Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349 . The specialists iFixit awarded the phone a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The simplified camera app automates more of the photo-taking and hides many features behind sliding buttons.

The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting. New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too. Zooming beyond 15-20x to a max of 40x magnification, the photos have obvious signs of being blown up by digital zoom. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian All three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets. Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone. Price The iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/ $1,099 / A$1,999 ) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599 , iPhone 17 costs £799 , iPhone Air costs £999 , iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199 , the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999 , the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499 . Verdict The 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models. The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous. But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera. That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business. So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it. Pros: looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/08/apple-iphone-17-pro-review-different-looks-zoom-battery-life,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7d11d279bcb7bebdd0dde32529c7fe7684a68c/567_0_5840_4672/master/5840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8eb7b0faaa45628356c0f1d182b32163",2025-10-08T06:00:18+00:00,e201c64b5a37ec106c75ab6c29a8c5fc55e5d838
fbc63ee43db3,Pixel 10 Pro XL review: Google’s superphone gets AI and magnetic upgrades,,"G oogle’s Pixel superphone is back, packed with a bigger battery, faster charging, magnetic accessories and even more cutting-edge AI tools to try to usurp Apple and Samsung as the monarchs of really big phones. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest slab phone Google makes and is one of the biggest available in Europe and the US. It costs £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999), sitting above its smaller sibling the Pixel 10 Pro and below the upcoming folding Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max and Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra . The 10 Pro XL is almost identical on the outside to the 9 Pro XL it replaces in terms of dimensions but with 11g of additional weight. It is a big, heavy phone that requires two hands to use most of the time and benefits from a phone grip or handle. The Pixel has a ring of magnets to attach any number of Qi2 or MagSafe accessories to the back including phone grips, such as the Popsocket, as well as car mounts, wallets, stands and batteries. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian It has a huge, bright and smooth OLED screen, which is one of the very best and excellent for watching TV and films. The back hides Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, making it one of a very small number of phones that can charge at up to 25W using a new generation of wireless chargers. The 10 Pro XL has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup and performs just as well , feeling rapid in general use. It plays games just fine, but those wanting the best graphics and frame rates in high-end mobile games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, such as the S25 Ultra. The biggest Pixel also has the largest battery with the longest run time. The 10 Pro XL matches its predecessor, lasting about 52 hours between charges after a mix of usage across wifi and 5G. The phone should outlast even the heaviest of usage days, with most people probably needing to charge it every other day. The phone takes less than 90 minutes to charge via cable or about two hours using a Qi2 25W wireless charger, such as the Ugreen MagFlow 2-in-1 (left) or Belkin UltraCharge Pro (right). Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Specifications Screen: 6.8in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (486ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 16GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm Weight: 232g Android 16 with AI Magic Cue is one of the most advanced AI features available, working silently in the background to produce helpful and timely information. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro XL has the same Android 16 software and AI features as the 10 Pro , making it one of the most expressive and polished experiences available. Google will provide updates until 2032 . The Gemini chatbot is available throughout the system, and has its own stand-alone app that can see what is on your screen or through the camera to help. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs locally in the background as a proactive little helper presenting data from your calendar, emails, chats and other Google apps on your phone when you need it. It will pop up with the location of a restaurant when a friend texts about your dinner date or shows your order emails in the phone app when you ring a recognised business. It works great in Google’s various apps, and a handful of third-party ones, but not WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps yet. The 10 Pro XL also comes with a year’s subscription for Google AI Pro , for access to the company’s more powerful Gemini models, and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email, worth £19 a month. Camera Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The big Pixel has the same camera system as the 10 Pro , meaning your choice is only about phone size not camera quality. The 50-megapixel main, 48MP ultra wide and 48MP 5x telephoto cameras are some of the very best you can get. Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions. It also has a handful of helpful AI tools including: the novel Camera Coach ; Add Me , which blends two photos to put the photographer into group shots; and Best Take , which has now been made automatic. It helps get group shots where everyone is looking at the camera by shooting a photo when everyone is looking once you press the shutter button or blending multiple shots where needed. Finally, it has the Pro Res Zoom feature that kicks in when you push beyond 30x magnification and uses genAI to put the detail and sharpness back into images lost to digital zoom. It isn’t always perfect and is switched off when the system detects a person, but it can have remarkable results, making blurry 100x zoom images much clearer and more usable. But it is also not a true photo at that point, as it has been interpreted and remade by AI, and is labelled as such by the camera app using C2PA content credentials . Overall, whether you use the AI tools or not, the Pixel has one of the very best camera systems on the market. Sustainability The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the screen is super fast and accurate, making unlocking the phone a breeze. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery is rated to last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops, or self-repair using manuals and parts available . The Pixel 10 Pro XL contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free. Price The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL costs from £1,199 (€1,299/ $1,199 / A$1,999 ) in a choice of four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 costs from £799 , the Pixel 10 Pro from £999 , the Pixel 9a costs £399 , the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199 . Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro XL is a true superphone in size, price and capability. If you like what Google’s been doing with 6.3in smartphones but want everything bigger, this is the model to get. The camera is one of the very best, the screen is great and the software, including Google’s most cutting-edge AI features, is top notch. The addition of Qi2.2 support speeds up wireless charging, but more helpfully opens up a world of magnetic accessories including grips to make the big phone easier to hold. The Pixel feels responsive but it isn’t a dramatic upgrade on last year’s 9 Pro XL model . When it comes to raw power, particularly for games, the Pixel falls short against rivals such as the Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra, which remains the superphone to beat . Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, great big screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, great size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included. Cons: very expensive, huge and heavy, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical Sim card slot in the US, not a massive upgrade. Note that the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes without a physical sim slot in the top of the phone in the US, relying entirely on eSims.

00500fa764eb,Google Pixel 10 Pro review: one of the very best smaller phones,,"The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s best phone that is still a pocketable, easy-to-handle size, taking the excellent Pixel 10 and beefing it up in the camera department. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold. The 10 Pro looks almost identical to last year’s version and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen as the Pixel 10 but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling. Qi2 support makes the Pixel compatible with magnetic chargers, such as the Anker 5K MagGo Slim that attaches to the back of the phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe. Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip used in rivals . Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates. The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left. The Pixel 10 Pro takes 90 minutes to fully charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 52% in just over half an hour. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 16GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm Weight: 207g Android 16 with AI everywhere Google’s take on Android is colourful, fairly simple and easy to use with a reasonable amount of customisation. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates until August 2032 , ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the regular Pixel 10 with a bold, colourful and fun design. Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy. The advanced Gemini chatbot is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice. Magic Cue provides quick access to contextual information from the data stored on your phone across a number of Google and third-party apps. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian But the standout new feature is Magic Cue , which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them. Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to Google AI Pro , which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail. Camera The camera app is simple to use with plenty of modes to make the best of your photography, including manual controls. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is. The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions. Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too. Pro Res Zoom above 30x uses a local generative AI model to recreate the detail lost by digital zoom, saving both pre- and post-processed images for you to choose from. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable. When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script. The camera app adds C2PA content credentials to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera. The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing. The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market. Sustainability The front and back of the Pixel are covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.

Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel or set a new bar in quite the same way as the base-model Pixel 10 managed this year . But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features. It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years. Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps. Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish. The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.

d96070fab3a2,Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 review: the most comfortable noise cancelling headphones,,"Bose has updated its top-of-the-line noise-cancelling headphones with longer battery, USB-C audio and premium materials, making the commuter favourites even better. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The second-generation QuietComfort Ultra headphones still have an expensive price tag, from £450 (€450/$450/A$700), which is more than most competitors, including Sony’s WH-1000XM6 . The headphones at least look and feel expensive. Bose has polished the sliding aluminium arms and tweaked the colours, while keeping the shape, weight and fit the same as their predecessors. The result is a pair of the most plush and comfortable headphones you can buy. A selection of bolder colours are available. Composite: Bose The controls for adjusting noise cancelling, immersion modes and playback are all responsive and fairly straightforward. The touch-sensitive volume slider is excellent, and it can double as a shortcut for your choice of action, including accessing your phone’s voice assistant or starting music from Spotify or similar. The battery lasts for up to 30 hours of playback with noise cancelling, which is six hours longer than the outgoing model and competitive with the best rivals – certainly long enough for a flight or two. New is the ability to listen to the headphones while charging via Bluetooth , the headphones cable or directly over the USB-C cable for lossless listening with phones, tablets and computers. The button and slider controls are in the back of the right ear cup while the USB-C and headphones ports are in the left. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian They support Bluetooth 5.4 and can connect to two devices at once, such as a phone for calls and a laptop for music. In addition to the standard SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats, the Bose can also support Qualcomm’s aptX Adaptive for higher-quality audio with compatible Android devices or Bluetooth dongles. Specifications Weight: 250g Dimensions: 195 x 139 x 50.8mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint, 2.5/3.5mm, USB-C audio and charging Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive Battery life: 30 hours Great sound and noise cancelling The headphone arms adjust well to the side of your head while the ear cups are quite deep and the cushions are extremely plush for a comfortable fit. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Bose is synonymous with noise cancelling and has led the pack for a long time. The new Ultra headphones have some of the most effective noise reduction available, dealing easily with the rumbles, roars and other sounds of flights and the commute. They can’t block out quite as much of the high tones, such as background chatter or keyboard taps, as the Sony WH-1000XM6 but they are close. They also have a very good transparency mode that lets you hear what’s happening around you while dampening sudden or very loud sounds to keep things comfortable. Call quality is equally good, with my voice coming through clearly in quiet environments and noisy city streets while eliminating background noise. The Bose app for Android and iPhone takes care of settings, updates and customisation options. Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The headphones sound great for everyday listening with a bass-accentuated profile that suits a lot of modern tracks. The bass is punchy and well controlled to avoid overriding other tones, while the highs are detailed and slightly boosted. Some may find Bose’s sound a little too clean, lacking a bit of rawness in some tracks, but good separation of tones and a system that keeps music sounding great at any volume makes them a comfortable listen, ideal for travel, the commute or working. New for the Ultras is a cinema mode for Bose’s immersive sound system, which simulates surround sound for films and TV. It works pretty well and does so regardless of the phone, computer or tablet you connect it to, which is great for those with more than one brand of device. It joins the standard immersive audio mode that simulates having stereo speakers placed in front of you, which I found good for some big tracks but not for others. Sustainability The Bose are plush but feel robust and ready for travel. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The battery will last more than 500 full charge cycles and is replaceable by Bose. The headphones are generally repairable and replacement parts, including ear cushions , are available. The headphones do not contain recycled materials. Bose runs trade-in programmes and sells refurbished stock but does not publish individual product environmental impact reports. Price The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones (2nd gen) cost £449.95 (€449.95/ $449.99 / A$699.95 ). For comparison, the Sony WH-1000XM6 cost £399 , the Sonos Ace cost £299 , the Beats Studio Pro cost £349.99 , the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless cost £199 and the Fairbuds XL cost £219 . Verdict The second-generation Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are a quality set of cans that deliver more of what the firm is known for: good sound, great noise cancelling and supreme comfort. They may no longer be the most effective noise cancellers available, with the recent Sony WH-1000XM6 taking the crown. But they are very close and are the most comfortable headphones you’ll find, making them ideal for travel and long listening sessions. They fold up neatly and compactly, have a solid 30-hour battery life and can be connected by Bluetooth, analogue headphones cable or USB-C for charging and listening, so they should work with any device. The very high price tag is sadly in line with rivals, but should come down in routine sales. With replacement ear cups and other parts available from Bose and third-parties, they should at least last a long time to make them worth the investment. Pros: supremely comfortable, top-class noise cancelling and good sound, immersive/spatial audio, great connectivity including Bluetooth multipoint and USB-C or analogue cable audio, fold up for travel, cross-platform companion app, long battery life. Cons: very expensive, sound and noise cancelling beaten by Sony, mics cannot be used with analogue cable. The headphones fold up for travel in a good, compact case.

f30a414206e0,"AirPods Pro 3 review: better battery, better noise cancelling, better earbuds",,"A pple’s extremely popular AirPods Pro Bluetooth earbuds are back for their third generation with a better fit, longer battery life, built-in heart rate sensors and more effective noise cancelling, and look set to be just as ubiquitous as their predecessors. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . It has been three years since the last model , but the earbuds still come only in white and you really have to squint at the details to spot the difference from the previous two generations. The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/$249/A$429), making them £30 cheaper in the UK than when their predecessors launched, and sit above the AirPods 4 , which cost £169 with noise cancelling for those who don’t like silicone earbud tips. The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked, changing slightly the way you put them in and making them more comfortable than their predecessors for extended listening sessions of three hours or more. Five sizes of tips are included in the box, but if you didn’t get on with silicone earbuds before these won’t make a difference. The stalks are the same length as before , but the shape of the earbud has been changed to better align the tip with your ear canal. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Most of the features are fairly standard for modern earbuds. Squeeze the stalks for playback controls, swipe for volume or take them out to pause the music. They support the same new features rolled out to Apple’s older earbuds, including the ability to use them as a shutter remote for the camera app and for live translation with the Translate app on the iPhone. The latter is limited to English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish for now and isn’t available in the EU, but it works surprisingly well for casual conversations. The biggest problem is that the other person will have to rely on reading or hearing your translated speech from your iPhone. I can see it being most useful with announcements or audio guides – the kind you get on transport or in museums where you need only to translate language one way. The most interesting added hardware feature is heart rate monitoring via sensors on the side of the earbuds, similar to Apple’s Powerbeats Pro 2 fitness buds . They can be used with more than 50 workouts started in the Fitness app or a handful of third-party apps on the iPhone and proved to be roughly in line with readings from a Garmin Forerunner 970 or an Apple Watch during walks and runs. The earbuds are water-resistant to IP57 standards, which makes them much more robust against rain and sweat than before. The battery life has been increased by a third to at least eight hours of playback with noise cancelling for each charge, which is very competitive with some of the best rivals and long enough for most listening sessions. The compact flip-top case provides two full charges for a total playback time of 24 hours – six hours short of the previous generation, but five minutes in the case is enough for an hour of listening time. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Specifications Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, UWB Battery life: eight hours ANC playback (24 hours with case) Water resistance: IP57 (buds and case) Earbud dimensions: 30.9 x 19.2 x 27.0mm Earbud weight: 5.6g each Charging case dimensions: 47.2 x 62.2 x 21.8mm Charging case weight: 44g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless/MagSafe, Apple Watch Bigger sound and impressive noise cancelling The silicone earbuds are infused with foam in the tips that expands slightly for a better seal for music and noise cancelling. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The sound of the third-generation AirPods Pro takes a great listen and makes it bigger. They have a wider soundscape that makes big tracks sound more expansive, while still maintaining strong but nicely controlled bass. They are detailed, well-balanced and do justice to different genres of music, with plenty of power and punch where needed. As with Apple’s other headphones, they sometimes sound a little too clinical, lacking a bit of warmth or rawness in some tracks, and they can’t quite hit the very deepest of notes for skull-rattling bass. However, few earbuds sound better at this price and size. Apple’s implementation of spatial audio for surround sound for movies remains best in class, adding to the immersion with compatible devices and services, even if spatial audio music remains a mixed bag. The AirPods Pro are the best combination of earbuds and compact case that you can easily fit in a pocket. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The improved noise cancelling is the best upgrade. Apple says it is twice as effective as the already good AirPods Pro 2, which sounds about right. In side-by-side comparisons, the AirPods Pro 3 handle street noise, including cars, horns and engines, almost as well as the class-leading Sony WH-1000XM6 , which is thoroughly impressive given they are large over-ear headphones, not little earbuds. They also do a great job of dampening the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard clicks and speech, making the commute and office work more bearable. Apple’s class-leading transparency mode is just as good on the new earbuds, sounding natural as if you weren’t actually wearing the earbuds. It makes using them as hearing aids or out on the street with some dampening of sudden loud sounds very good indeed. Call quality is first-rate, and my voice sounded clear and natural in quiet or noisy environments with only a hint of road noise from some loud streets audible on the call. Sustainability The case charges via USB-C, MagSafe, Qi or Apple Watch charger, and has a new feature to limit charging of the earbuds to prolong their battery health. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable, but Apple offers a battery service for £49 per earbud or case and offers replacements for those lost or damaged costing from £79 an item. The repair specialists iFixit rated the earbuds zero out of 10 for repairability . The AirPods and case contain 40% recycled material by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes and breaks down the environmental impact of the earbuds in its report . Price The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/ $249 / A$429 ). For comparison, the AirPods 4 start at £119 , the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 cost £250 , the Sennheiser Momentum TW4 cost £199 , the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost £219 , the Sony WF-1000XM5 cost £219 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds cost £300 . Verdict The AirPods Pro 3 take what was great about the ubiquitous second-generation models and improves almost everything. Longer battery life and a better, more comfortable fit for extended listening sessions are very welcome, as is the bigger, wider sound. Proper water resistance and built-in heart rate monitoring makes them useful for workouts, particularly those such as powerlifting that make wearing a watch difficult. The live translation feature worked better than expected, but has limitations that make it less useful for real-life conversations. The best bit is very effective noise cancelling that rivals some of the greatest over-ear headphones, but in a tiny set of earbuds that are much easier to carry around. Audiophiles will find they sound a little too clinical. While they work with any Bluetooth device, including Android phones, PCs and games consoles, they require an iPhone, iPad or Mac for full functionality. But the biggest letdown remains repairability , which remains a problem for most true wireless earbuds and loses them a star . Pros: very effective noise cancelling, great sound, best-in-class transparency, water resistance, built-in HR monitoring, great controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, very comfortable, excellent case, top class call quality. Cons: extremely difficult to repair, expensive, no hi-res audio support, lack features when connected to Android/Windows, look the same as predecessors, only available in white. The AirPods Pro 3 are some of the very best earbuds you can buy, particularly if you use an iPhone.

8bb7e3d15be0,Apple Watch Series 11 review: wrist-flickingly good with longer battery life,,"The Apple Watch Series 11 adds the one thing most people actually want from a smartwatch: longer battery life. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . Otherwise the new model is a direct replacement for the Series 10 , matching it in design, dimensions and features, with most of its upgrades coming from software. That makes it one of the very best smartwatches available, even if it hasn’t changed much. The Series 11 is also £30 cheaper in the UK, costing from £369 (€449/$399/A$679), and sits above the newly revamped £219 Watch SE at the low end and the £749 Ultra 3 at the high end. The Series 11 comes in space grey, which was a colour first introduced with the iPhone 5s in 2013 . Everything that is old is new again. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Like last year’s Series 10, the new model is only 9.7mm thick, which makes it a slim fit to the wrist, easy to sneak under cuffs and more comfortable at night. It is light, slim and easy to live with. The 2,000nit OLED screen is plenty bright for seeing indoors and out, remaining clear to read off-angle, which makes glancing down at the time or notifications easy. It is covered by glass that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as before, although not as hard as sapphire, which is reserved for the more expensive titanium models. The new watch has the same S10 chip as last year’s model but now supports optional 5G and stronger reception for those times when you’re in the wilderness. The batteries have increased in capacity by 9% and 11% for the 42mm and 46mm watches respectively. The 46mm lasted a good two days in testing with sleep tracking but without exercise. Most people will just about be able to track two days and two nights before needing a charge, which takes 66 minutes using a 20W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting about 70% in 30 minutes. If you do go out for a run, it will last about eight hours of tracking, which is long enough for a marathon or two. Specifications Case size: 42 or 46mm Case thickness: 9.7mm Weight: about 30g or 37g Processor: S10 Storage: 64GB Operating system: watchOS 26 Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, mic, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, UWB, optional 5G watchOS 26 The Flow watch face is fun but I struggle to read the time at a glance. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Series 11 ships with watchOS 26 , which runs on all models from 2020’s Series 6 and newer. It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials. The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist. Hypertension, sleep and AI workouts Hypertension alerts use the same optical sensor on the back of the watch as used for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement, no pressure cuff required. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app. Hypertension alerts look for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem. The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too. Sleep score makes it easier to understand whether you’re getting good enough sleep at a glance, with more details if you need it. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Workout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics. There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you also carry your iPhone 15 Pro or later with you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs. Sustainability The recycled aluminium frame feels high quality, slim and comfortable on your wrist. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Apple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95 . Repairs cost between £295 and £389 depending on the model. It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report . Price The Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/ $399 / A$679 ). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170). For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749 , the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219 , the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from £349 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from £294 . Verdict The Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life. The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too. The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs. Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as a Series 6 , you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design. Pros: great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps. Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/06/apple-watch-series-11-review-wrist-flickingly-good-with-longer-battery-life,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf54fc125a373f3700455e4f6bfa6844f7d6d9ff/1664_757_3666_2932/master/3666.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=255f3aac31916843dfd532331883c677",2025-10-06T06:00:03+00:00,0dbc4f96c23d03bf3a27d519b76f963f7b188709
afa6ac39c323,Sky Glass Air review: a surprisingly good budget smart TV,,"S ky’s latest streaming TV aims to be a good, all-in-one budget option for your sitting room – and it achieves all those aims, leaving it standing strong in a field of mediocre, similarly priced appliances. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more . The Glass Air is a lighter, slimmer and cheaper version of the Glass gen 2 and is arguably the low-cost TV Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront. As with its pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as a basic smart TV with streaming apps, an aerial and its three HDMI ports, but you would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its TV-over-broadband service. Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it a fraction of the weight and thickness. The slim plastic frame is available in a choice of three colours with matching remote. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian It also means all it needs is a power cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the mic button on the remote and speak into that. The 60Hz screen is a bright and crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can look a little bleached out. Despite this, the television does a good job of displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing a solid job with bright animation or moody movies. Glass Air has three HDMI ports, an optical port, two USB ports, ethernet and an aerial socket, but only needs power and wifi to actually work. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The 15W stereo speakers are surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90% volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers. They lack bass and any attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen. Sky OS The modern Sky interface puts all of your content, whether live or on-demand, in one easy to use system. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian One of the biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS has improved dramatically over the last few years and runs well on the Glass Air. It combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+. Glass Air also supports AirPlay 2 for sending content from Apple’s various devices and Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening. Sustainability The TV switches to a screensaver before turning off when not used for a set time, detecting your presence through motion sensors in the remote. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The television is repairable apart from the screen . It contains recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging. Price The Sky Glass Air is available in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for 65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee. The minimum required Sky package is Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+, with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans. Verdict Sky Glass Air is a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over broadband service built in. It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most low-end smart TVs. Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with one remote and just power and internet required. You can get better-looking mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable budget TVs at this end of the market. Pros: all-in-one streaming and pay-TV device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps, voice control, custom picture modes. Cons: no local dimming means lower contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support, requires subscription. The TV slots on to two metal prongs on a sturdy plastic stand with no tools required or it can be wall-mounted instead.

65079681ffe7,Battlefield 6 is yet another cliche-ridden war game. We deserve better,,"A nd so Battlefield is back. The long-running military shooter series, which specialises in gigantic online multiplayer conflicts involving dozens of ground troops, tanks and aircraft, has returned for its sixth main instalment – and it’s thrilling, epic and compulsive . Apart from the single-player campaign mode, which I absolutely hated. It’s another oh-so-familiar tale of preternaturally talented soldiers just doing their jobs to defend the free world in the face of evil private military companies, terror organisations or double-crossing CIA operatives. It could be almost any military shooter of the last decade or any straight-to-streaming war film starring one of the Hemsworths. But it’s not. It’s a seven-hour cliche bombardment that you have to take an active part in. The thing is, nobody buys Battlefield for the campaign mode. In fact, most games in the series haven’t had one. So this was a chance for the developers to experiment a little, try something new or even subversive. The mainstream movie biz may have been equally guilty of dressing up jingoistic celebrations of the military-industrial complex as thrilling action flicks, but it has also produced Paths of Glory, M*A*S*H and The Deer Hunter. While Battlefield 6 does make the occasional nod towards the less-than-ideal circumstances of modern hybrid warfare, you don’t care much because the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no backstories who speak in nonstop military jargon. There have been a few big games that have challenged the narrative of the moral warrior acting in the world’s best interests on behalf of largely benign military divisions. Metal Gear Solid is clearly a pacifist text on the horror of nuclear war, while Ubisoft’s Valiant Hearts is a beautiful meditation on war and love. The key example, though, remains Yager Development’s fascinating 2012 adventure Spec Ops: The Line, in which you play the commander of a covert delta team sent into a disaster-hit Dubai to discover the whereabouts of a rogue US military unit. As the narrative progresses , your character descends into exhaustion and trauma, experiencing increasingly nightmarish hallucinations. The aim was to show the damaging psychological impact of war, while also providing a gripping and exciting experience. The mission was successful. War stories … Spec Ops: The Line is the rare military game with meaning. Photograph: Yager In the rapidly consolidating games industry, where gigantic mega-corps are willing to invest the equivalent of a small country’s GDP into capturing tens of millions of players, it seems that narrative innovation is unlikely. As is making any kind of political statement. But contemporary audiences are spoiled for choice when it comes to shooters – as the success of oddities such as Atomfall and Megabonk have shown – there’s money to be made in straying off piste. Could the Battlefield 6 campaign have been a tense claustrophobic single-set thriller like Alex Garland’s Warfare? Could it have plunged our hero into a series of survival dramas like Until Dawn? Could it have been a sandbox adventure with various tasks, items and enemy units to discover? Over the past two years we’ve seen several multimillion dollar projects axed and staff made redundant because the “pick-me” approach of green-lighting only titles that will compete directly with the always on nature of Fortnite, Call of Duty or Marvel Rivals is a zero sum game – you win or you die. Call me naive, but that doesn’t seem sustainable (not even for those mega-titles ) – and considering the human cost of mass layoffs, it’s also repugnant. Games cannot live on cliche alone. The modern world, with its shifting allegiances, its climate instability and its displaced populations, is a horrifyingly fascinating place for brand-new war narratives that actually mean something. If only someone had the guts to tell them. What to play A love letter to the age of instant messaging … VideoVerse.

The children’s electronic toy manufacturer Leap Frog has a range of Leapster handhelds, which can be picked up second hand for around £20-30 usually with a couple of cartridges. They’re chunky and safe, and the games are OK. However, I’d rather go for a Nintendo DS or the newer and more hardy 2DS , both of which go on eBay for around £10-£50 depending on condition. There are hundreds of children’s games available for these systems (original DS games can be played on both systems, but the 2DS will also play newer 3DS games – though not in 3D) and games can be picked up for as little as 50p in charity shops or at your local CeX store . With the original DS, the hinge that connects the two screens is the most vulnerable point, but it depends on how rough your daughter is with it. Also, both systems come with a stylus, which is a potential choke hazard so you need to be around when she uses it. Also, my sons lost dozens of them. Luckily a lot of games don’t need them. As for games, anything with Mario , Wario or Kirby , and any Animal Crossing , Pokémon or Lego title will be go down well.

4313701a9793,Space Harrier at 40: how Sega’s surreal classic brought total immersion to arcades in the 80s,,"D uring our family’s holidays in the 1980s, most of which were spent at classic English seaside resorts, I spent all my time and pocket money trawling the arcades. From Shanklin to Blackpool, I played them all, attracted by those vast bulb-lit frontages, the enticing names (Fantasy Land! Treasure Island!), and of course by the bleeping, flashing video machines within. And while I spent many hours on the staple classics – Pac-Man, Galaxian, Kung Fu Master – there was one particular game I always looked out for. A weird, thrilling design classic. A total experience, operating somewhere between a traditional arcade game, a flight sim and a rollercoaster. At the time, it seemed impossibly futuristic. Now, it is 40 years old. Released by Sega in 1985, Space Harrier is a 3D space shooter in which you control a jetpack super soldier named Harrier, who flies into the screen blasting surreal alien enemies above a psychedelic landscape. When designer Yu Suzuki was first tasked with overseeing its development, the game had been conceived as an authentic military flight shooter, but the graphical limitations of the day made that impossible – there was too much complex animation. So Suzuki, inspired by the flying sequences in the fantasy movie The NeverEnding Story , envisaged something different and more surreal, with a flying character rather than a fighter plane and aliens resembling stone giants and dragons. It was colourful and crazy, like a Roger Dean painting brought to life by the Memphis Group . The real draw, though, was the game’s motion cabinet: you sat in a cockpit-style seat connected to two motors that provided jolting eight-directional movement. When the Harrier flew up, you went up with it, when he banked to the left or right, you did too. Enemies would fly at you constantly, coming from all angles, switching directions and altitude, so you were constantly swooping and rising, flinging yourself around, living every moment. All the while, a synth pop score composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who also worked on Suzuki’s games After Burner and OutRun , blasted out of speakers in the seat’s headrest. And groundbreaking speech synthesis allowed the machine to bark out encouragement and instruction. “Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!” Space Harrier, then, was a complete sensory experience, which perfectly illustrated Suzuki’s expertise in immersion. It was just one of his projects of the era which he referred to as taikan , or body sensation games. OutRun, Space Harrier, After Burner and Power Drift all arrived in arcades with big motor- or hydraulic-driven cabinets designed to put you right inside the experience. Suzuki and his team also developed an animation technology known as Super Scaler, which allowed the manipulation and rotation of thousands of 2D animation frames to create the impression of 3D worlds. But what I most loved about Space Harrier was the way this motion was applied to a fantastical universe of chequerboard planets and surrealist aliens. It was like taking part in an interactive 1980s pop video. It is timeless in the same way as Pac-Man or Tetris, because it exists in a heightened, abstract world of its own. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could put that cabinet in any arcade in the world today (if you can find one) and it would still draw people in. But sadly, that’s becoming less and less likely to happen. The machines are old and worn, and the expert knowledge required to repair and maintain them is fading. Apart from the various home computer and console translations (of which the PC Engine and 32X ports are arguably the best), I haven’t played it in years. I don’t know how I’d feel now, sitting in that seat, putting two 10p coins in the slot, holding the joystick in anticipation. Would I be able to lose myself in the game again, or would I see me at 13, skulking around the arcades of the north of England? It doesn’t matter.

b294b7ac302e,"Battlefield 6 review – operatic, ear-shattering all-encompassing warfare",,"B arely a minute into your first round of the large-scale multiplayer mode, Conquest, you will know you are back in Battlefield at its absolute best. Fighter jets scorch over head, tanks rumble by, the side of a building is obliterated by a rocket-propelled grenade. While Call of Duty has always focused its online matches on close skirmishes, Battlefield 6 makes you feel part of a vast military offensive, bewildering and ear-shattering, with even the quiet moments punctuated by the pop-pop of distance rifle fire, the shouts of orders and the cries for medics. It’s well known that EA’s long-running first-person shooter series has hit trouble over the last couple of years, with futuristic instalment Battlefield 2042 widely considered a disappointment. So this time round, the development team (a collective of studios including original creator DICE) has gone back to the excellent Battlefield 4 for inspiration, where the emphasis was on authentic-feeling modern military warfare on large maps with lots of players. As ever, Battlefield 6 gives you the choice of four classes – Assault, Support, Engineer and Recon – each with its own weapons and gadgets, all of which can be upgraded and customised as you level up your soldier and gain experience. It’s a hybrid system taking elements of older Battlefields as well as newer Call of Duty titles, where the Gunsmith system revolutionised weapon personalisation for first-person online shooters. Brooklyn at war … Battlefield 6. Photograph: Electronic Arts The best online modes are the big ones, such as Conquest and Breakthrough, which focus on taking swathes of territory from the other team by holding down objective points. There are small and mid-sized modes, too, including King of the Hill and Domination, but to Battlefield veterans they feel like gestures to a different school of thought. From the very beginning – 2002’s seminal Battlefield 1942 – this series has encouraged tactical, thoughtful play, gathering a few comrades and sneaking up on enemy bases, timing attacks with helicopter support, wearing down defences. In a good session there maybe several minutes where you are hiking across the map, or crawling towards a well-defended building. The meat-grinder feel of Call of Duty, with its turbo-charged pace and five-second shootouts, feels a long way away. Yet, when you’re caught in a battle in this game, it is exhilarating. Whether you’re on the streets of Brooklyn or the sands of Cairo, chunks of exploded masonry fly by, bullets strafe metal, tanks explode in fiery billows of flame and smoke. The visuals and sound design are astonishingly good, capturing the grainy, shaky-cam faux-documentary style of Generation Kill or Warfare, rather than the choreographed action movie carnage of CoD. If you’re lucky enough to get on a good team (and I really recommend playing with at least one or two friends), a real sense of underfire camaraderie develops. The weak point is the game’s superfluous Campaign mode, a hackneyed techno thriller set in the near future where a private military company is aiming to take control of the world, and only a hardy team of American-controlled spec-ops warriors can stop them. It’s a tired setup – and something of a cop out. By making the baddie a fictitious military corporation, the developers can pretend the story is meaningful and relevant without having to, God forbid, make a political point or implicate a country that may well be a market for the game – or an investor in Electronic Arts. It’s also hard to maintain any interest in a group of Identi-Kit tough guys who constantly spout lines such as: “There ain’t no red tape out here,” and (while staking out an enemy base on sunny Gibraltar): “I don’t know what’s more impressive, the view or the firepower.” When lead character Murphy says to a comrade: “There ain’t nobody I’d rather be in this fight with,” I wished there was an option to defect. Don’t let that put you off. For the most part, Battlefield 6 is a brilliant return to form, a thrilling, almost operatic shooter experience, which manages to combine deafening combat with tactical subtlety. How it will fit into the modern landscape of hero shooters and battle royale blast-em-ups is anyone’s guess – it deserves a shot, that’s for sure.",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/13/battlefield-6-review-operatic-ear-shattering-all-encompassing-warfare,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17afeb17628f79958f6b4d15480eb1f45936df3b/946_424_2170_1736/master/2170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9ea288c199f5f0450f24551bd31ea96d",2025-10-13T09:00:17+00:00,82e3e30564783912cc9437cbcdd20aa66d79aabd
cc8c49344d0c,"Meet Anamanaguchi, the band behind the last Scott Pilgrim video game’s soundtrack – and the next one",,"S cott Pilgrim, the series of pop culture-saturated graphic novels by Canadian author and comic book artist Bryan Lee O’Malley, has become a timeless epic about teenage insecurity, love and redemption, and the intersection of arrogance and self-esteem – as well as a Canadian interpretation of emo, indie rock and shōnen-style comic books. It is a coming-of-age tale about an initially unlikable teenage boy growing up in the 00s, who matures through six graphic novels that deftly reference everything from Japanese manga to western superheroes, video games and Tintin. It is also, of course, a hit movie , a 2022 Netflix anime series , and a 2010 video game – the last two of which were soundtracked by New York City-based indie rock band Anamanaguchi. ‘My favourite scene in the Scott Pilgrim anime is where Knives and Kim are just jamming in a room together, and almost nothing happens,” laughs Peter Berkman, one of the lead songwriters and guitarists in the band. “It’s just one of those slice-of-life moments where you remember why you love music in the first place. It really struck a chord with me. No pun intended.” Sex Bob-Omb in Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Photograph: Album/Alamy Anamanaguchi gained some notoriety for using video game hardware in their early, instrumental music, becoming one of the pioneering bands in the chiptune genre – all while they were still at college. During the band’s first self-funded tour, during which Berkman slept on the couch of the band he was supporting, he got amessage out of nowhere. “I got an email from somebody working at Ubisoft about a video game for a universal IP tie-in, and they didn’t go any further than that. ‘Could that be the new Alien vs Predator game or something like that?’, I thought. But I knew that – no matter what – when I brought that back to the band, we would say yes to whatever it was … we had all grown up loving video game and movie soundtracks.” It turned out to be an invitation to compose music for the first Scott Pilgrim video game, which was released in 2010. Now, Anamanaguchi is in the midst of a renaissance: in 2022, when the game was re-released as a Complete Edition, the band embarked on the Scott Pilgrim vs the World: The Game Soundtrack tour. Last year, the band wrote and performed music for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, a Netflix spin-off that acts as a meta commentary on Scott’s life. Anamanaguchi supported Hatsune Miku in her Fortnite festival appearance this year, a perfect fit for a band whose identity has always rested at the intersection of video games and live music, and in August, they launched Anyway, their first record in six years, which trades in the band’s synth-based bleeps and blorps for something decidedly more alt-rock, though the 8-bit influences of its members still remain if you listen hard enough. And they’re also working on the soundtrack for a new Scott Pilgrim game, due out next year, another playful beat-’em-up. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Gary Miller/Getty Images As one arm of the band experiments with analogue sounds and alt-rock angst, the other is moving back to Scott Pilgrim. There is a direct link between Anamanaguchi’s return to the series and the new voice they’ve found on their records. “Doing the soundtrack for the new game, Scott Pilgrim EX, allowed us to see what it would be like to dampen that aspect in our own record world, knowing that we were going full in, soundtrack-style, on the game,” says Berkman. Berkman says that in the 15 years between games, the band have matured when it comes to their approach to music. They have gained experience as producers, they have grown “as listeners of music”, and they have become even more excited by the range of styles that video game music represents. “You need to feel that connection between what you’re experiencing as a player and - even in a beat-em-up! - what the story is trying to do at that moment,” says Berkman. “If a situation calls for a dark, gothic industrial thing, we can make that happen – and we can make it happen in a way it never has before… [Scott PilgrimEX developer Tribute Games] has let us be a hands-on with the audio mix. and with the musical cues we want. That freedom is extremely important to us. The flow of the music, the way it makes you feel… you can really feel the authorship in video game soundtracks.” On the beach in Scott Pilgrim EX. Photograph: Tribute Games Inc Having played a demo of Scott Pilgrim EX, it seems that Tribute Games’ trust in the band has paid off. The music is playful and toys with convention, setting up prompts or expectations, only to surprise you with how sound effects or motifs become part of a level’s texture. It actually reminds me of Sea Power’s work on Disco Elysium, strange as that comparison may seem to anyone who knows their music. Sea Power were given lot of creative control in adapting their sound to fit the morose world of Revachol, and Tribute Games has done the same here, even if the with pixel art, neon colours, and buoyant adolescence of it all deliver a completely different tone. “Tribute Games has given us a level of freedom that can only be matched by a company just … not knowing what you’re doing,” laughs Berkman. “We’ve been able to be a part of the development process in a way that we weren’t in the last time, you know? We’re getting nightly builds, and we’re able to ask: ‘Is this stagnant? Do I need to add a part here?’ It really helps with the arrangement, and in understanding the feel.

9478114a4784,The non-profit helping people from all over the world to become successful game developers,,"G amescom, the annual video game convention held in Cologne, Germany, is a unique event. It not only draws hundreds of thousands of players to pack out vast convention halls each year, but it also hosts professionals, offering them a chance to get their games into the hands of fans, and gives industry hopefuls a shot at passing their résumés to developers. For those based outside the US, it is the biggest event of the year by far. It is the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) Foundation’s first year here, and executive director Alyssa Walles is excited. The IGDA Foundation provides professional development for underrepresented and marginalised people hoping to enter the video game industry, a crucial service considering the many barriers prospective producers, developers and writers face. Though Walles is fairly new to the IGDA Foundation, having joined three years ago, she is a video game industry veteran. She knows how crucial it is to help those who aren’t born into privileged situations, who can’t afford to travel across the globe to conventions, or have not had traditional schooling in computer design or coding. Gamescom hosts video game fans and industry professionals. Photograph: Imago/Alamy “I was part of the launch team of PlayStation in Europe, and I was the only woman in the room most of the time,” Walles says. “So I am so happy to see that change.” But she knows there is more work to be done. The IGDA Foundation started by funding trips for a select group to the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an expensive endeavour that often excludes hundreds of developers from marginalised communities or more remote regions of the world. When the Covid pandemic redefined video game events, the IGDA Foundation had to get creative – that’s when former executive director Nika Nour came up with the Virtual Exchange, a six-week online programme that pairs grantees with a veteran game industry coach. Out of hundreds of annual applications, the IGDA Foundation selects grantees from three main pillars: games career professionals looking for more senior roles, professionals trying to transition into the games industry and recent graduates. Alyssa Walles of the IGDA Foundation. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation Walles says: “My favourite example of someone in our cohort who has work experience but is trying to break into the games industry is this young man from Nigeria. He’s a home builder, he’s project managing every day, building houses – and he codes. He wants to take that project management experience and become a producer in video games.” For Walles and many other industry veterans who become mentors with the IGDA Foundation, it is about using their experience to ensure the industry has a strong and diverse future. “I’m 65, I’m not afraid about saying that … I’m on the back end of my career, and I’m here to give back,” she says. But the IGDA Foundation, like so many other programmes dedicated to making the video game industry and tech spaces more equitable, has faced frustrating challenges in the last few years. After meteoric growth during the pandemic, the industry has seen record redundancies. Companies are telling Walles they don’t have money for the foundation, which she finds hard to believe (“I know you have $5,000”), and though the IGDA Foundation isn’t government-funded, the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have attacked diversity, equity and inclusivity institutions, which forces them to rethink how they market their programme and how to approach potential donors. “There have been several nonprofits that have had to close in our space. So far, we are not close to that. I worry about it every day,” Walles admits. “I think, how do I get to the people who have made a lot of money in video games and want to support that next generation?” 2025’s Virtual Exchange in action. Photograph: Courtesy IGDA Foundation But the IGDA Foundation, with Walles at the helm, is not afraid to get creative. Last year, she saw a story in a newsletter about how a solo developer made significant money from a single piece of downloadable content (DLC) sold in a Steam bundle. “I reached out to the IGDA Foundation’s alumni network and said, ‘I want to do a Steam event with DLC,’ and someone stepped forward to manage it. We created Download for Charity, an event we had in May – we had 24 games participate and raised $24,000,” Walles says. She has also organised game jams with Unlikely Collaborators and a recent porting initiative to help developers get their games on to Android phones. This dogged pursuit of funding is a testament to Walles’ dedication to the programme and to the marginalised people it serves. Walles’ hope for the future of the IGDA Foundation is simple: “We just want enough money to sustain us so we can provide these programmes for the people who need them around the world.” This article was amended on 15 October 2025. An earlier version misspelled the IGDA Foundation as the “IDGA Foundation”. Also, it should have been the Unlikely Collaborators, not the “unlikely collaborators”.",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/09/igda-the-non-profit-helping-people-from-all-over-the-world-to-become-successful-game-developers,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50ea177a6d263fb3f439ae50adb35fe40a6a0b11/263_186_3510_2808/master/3510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94c82c76caae6adc3729ac02f7989857",2025-10-09T14:53:43+00:00,d9509ddebda210bf529401bdb5a377764ec26621
3432e193a09a,‘Bored aliens’: has intelligent life stopped bothering trying to contact Earth?,,"For centuries, great thinkers have pondered why, given the hundreds of billions of planets in the galaxy, we have seen no compelling signs of intelligent life beyond Earth. Now, scientists are mulling an intriguing possibility: if aliens exist, their technology may be only marginally better than ours. And having explored their cosmic neighbourhood for a while, they simply got bored and stopped bothering, making it difficult to detect them. The scenario, described in a new paper , embraces the principle of “radical mundanity”, which shuns the notion of extraterrestrials zipping around the universe after harnessing physics beyond our comprehension. Instead, it proposes a Milky Way that is home to a modest number of civilisations with technology not wildly more impressive than our own. “The idea is that they’re more advanced, but not much more advanced. It’s like having an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17,” said Dr Robin Corbet, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who is based at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “This feels more possible, more natural, because it’s not proposing anything very extreme.” Corbet came up with the hypothesis after considering researchers’ explanations for the “great silence” or Fermi paradox , the discrepancy between the lack of compelling evidence for alien civilisations and the likelihood of their existence in a vast and aged universe. Most theories struck Corbet as exotic. Perhaps extraterrestrials were too advanced to be detected? Perhaps Earth was a cosmic zoo that aliens had agreed to leave alone? Perhaps Earth was the sole home for life in the galaxy? The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) has focused on detecting “technosignatures”. Advanced civilisations could advertise their existence by building powerful laser beacons that can be spotted from other planets. They may reveal themselves by sending robotic probes across the galaxy, or building enormous structures in space to harness the energy of their star. They could even visit other planets or scatter artefacts through the galaxy. All could make them visible. But the radical mundanity principle says not. It explains the great silence by proposing that extraterrestrial civilisations hit a technology plateau not far above our own capability. “They don’t have faster-than-light, they don’t have machines based on dark energy or dark matter, or black holes. They’re not harnessing new laws of physics,” Corbet said. If that were the case, alien civilisations would struggle to run powerful laser beacons for millions of years. They would not zip between planets. And after exploring the galaxy with robotic probes, they may get bored with the information sent back and give up on space exploration. The science fiction author Arthur C Clarke is purported to have said: “Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” Corbet, whose paper has yet to be peer reviewed, suspects the truth may lie somewhere in between “in a rather more mundane, and so less terrifying universe”. Contact, he adds, “could leave us somewhat disappointed”. Prof Michael Garrett, the director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, enjoyed the “fresh perspective” but voiced reservations. “It projects a very human-like apathy on to the rest of the cosmos. I find it hard to believe that all intelligent life would be so uniformly dull,” he said. Any technological plateau could be far above our level, he added. In a paper to be published in the journal Acta Astronautica, Garrett favours another theory. “I lean towards a more adventurous explanation of the Fermi paradox: that other, post-biological civilisations advance so rapidly that they slip beyond our capacity to perceive them,” he said. “I hope I’m right, but I could very well be wrong. Nature always has some kind of surprise for us around the corner.” Prof Michael Bohlander, an expert on SETI policy and the law at the University of Durham, said evidence may already have reached us in the form of unexplained aerial phenomena , or UAPs. “If only a small percentage of those objects were found not to be man-made – and the capabilities displayed by them in numerous sightings at the very least suggest a state of advance far beyond current publicly known human technology – then the question posed by Fermi, ‘Where is everyone?’, could be answered empirically,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/15/bored-aliens-has-intelligent-life-stopped-bothering-trying-to-contact-earth,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f2fe6d43818cc0074c63707c1b44cfe27c77ab6/0_712_1814_1450/master/1814.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32f023bb96e51d53f7d3e0257b041aea",2025-10-15T09:41:29+00:00,8f895a230b266566098209eee59ade63307a2035
4356af4c7bca,Plantwatch: An extraordinary orchid that lives and flowers underground,,"Rhizanthella is an extraordinary orchid that lives its entire life underground. It flowers below ground, has no leaves and survives by feeding on nutrients from a fungus that gets its food from the soil and by connecting with roots of the broom bush, Melaleuca uncinata . Rhizanthella was an international sensation when it was first discovered by a farmer ploughing a field in Western Australia in 1928. It still remains incredibly difficult to find, usually by searching areas with the right habitat and carefully scraping away soil searching for the blooms buried underneath – tiny reddish flowers wrapped in creamy-pink bracts. The blooms also have a heady scent of vanilla, and may be pollinated by termites or tiny flies. There are five species of Rhizanthella, all of them among the rarest orchids in the world. With very few surviving plants they are highly vulnerable to extinction after suffering loss of habitat and drought caused by climate breakdown. But the botanist Kingsley Dixon at the University of Western Australia is urgently trying to conserve the orchid by growing the fungus with the orchid seed in a lab and transferring them to Melaleuca bushes grown in pots.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/15/plantwatch-rhizanthella-an-extraordinary-orchid-that-lives-and-flowers-underground,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7ab728fd73cb4dab12debaff4cb73a726a572d/0_296_4096_3277/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c58abe54abaa016a3ac5a771d7b4aa4",2025-10-15T05:00:14+00:00,334cca4e7875b310162509c9bb78b8895ca2eb1e
dc388e631f37,A tiny rhino foetus developed by IVF: Jon A Juárez’s best photograph,,"T his photograph captures a moment of fragile hope: the world’s first IVF rhino pregnancy, a tiny foetus that reignited optimism among scientists fighting to save the northern white rhino from extinction. There are only two female northern white rhinos left on the planet – Najin and her daughter Fatu. Neither can carry a pregnancy due to health complications. The last male died in 2018 and that makes the species functionally extinct. For the past 15 years, the BioRescue Project – an international consortium dedicated to saving the species – has been collecting and preserving sperm from deceased males. Using this genetic material and egg cells from Fatu, they’ve created 38 embryos. It may sound like a lot, but it’s not. Since Najin and Fatu cannot carry a pregnancy, surrogate mothers are essential and it was decided to use southern white rhinos, a less endangered subspecies. The team also needed to prove that their technique would work with southern white rhino embryos before transferring any of the northern white rhino embryos into a surrogate. After 13 attempts to transfer an embryo they achieved the first viable IVF pregnancy in a southern white rhino. The foetus in this image is the result after transfer. Tragically, the pregnancy didn’t reach full term (16-18 months), as the surrogate mother died from a bacterial infection at 70 days. But the pregnancy demonstrated that the technique is viable – a critical milestone. This image goes beyond documentation. It's not showing a living animal but something much more fragile Ethics are central to the project and a dedicated team of ethical scientists monitor every step to ensure no harm is done. The northern white rhinos live in a conservancy in Kenya, protected around the clock by devoted rangers and caretakers. I understand that some may feel uneasy about surrogacy and IVF in animals, but I’ve seen first-hand how carefully the team evaluates animal welfare. Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the project’s lead, says science cannot be an excuse to repeat the mistakes of the past; it cannot be the sole solution; conservation must go hand in hand with science to prevent extinction. Before becoming a photographer, I studied biology. I dreamed of being a scientist, but science felt too vast, and my applications to research institutes were clumsy and naive. It never happened. Photography became my way back in. Years ago, I met the press officer for the BioRescue Project, based in Berlin, where I live and in 2020 he invited me and my partner – a journalist – to document the first embryo transfers of southern white rhinos in Germany. I was blown away. As a frustrated biologist, I was thrilled to work alongside this extraordinary team. Since then, I’ve followed their work – first in German zoos, and since 2023, in Kenya. I remember being at the airport in Germany, about to fly to Kenya to document what we hoped would be the first successful surrogacy – the team were buzzing with excitement. But while we were still at the airport, we received the news that the surrogate had died. It was devastating. The emotions were hard to put into words. This photograph was taken when the scientists were performing DNA checks on the foetus. The project came heartbreakingly close to success – it’s only a matter of time The image feels very different to the others I have taken for the project. It goes beyond documentation – it’s not showing a living animal or a scientific procedure, but something much more fragile. For me, it represents success and loss. It proves that the science works, but it also reminds us how close we are to losing this species for ever. I think it captures the emotional essence of the whole story. Even though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we listen to scientists and support their efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place. Yes, bad news matters – but we also need stories of perseverance. There are incredible people working tirelessly, refusing to give up. The project came heartbreakingly close to success. It’s only a matter of time. But time is running out. The German government, which has funded the project since 2019, has yet to confirm continued support. The next funding decision is due at the end of November. Without it, progress could stall – not just for the northern white rhino, but for other endangered species, too. That’s deeply disheartening, especially when the goal is within reach. If we keep sidelining environmental issues, we risk crossing a point of no return.

a49b4a5f920c,Lab-grown human embryo model produces blood cells,,"Scientists have grown embryo-like structures in the laboratory that produced human blood cells, raising new possibilities for regenerative medicine. The ability to generate blood stem cells in the laboratory may one day make it possible to treat patients in need of bone marrow transplants using their own cells. The advance is the latest in a rapidly advancing field in which embryo models are created from stem cells without the need for eggs or sperm, opening a window on the earliest stages of human development. “It was an exciting moment when the blood-red colour appeared in the dish – it was visible even to the naked eye,” said Dr Jitesh Neupane, a researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Gurdon Institute and first author of the study. He and his colleagues are using the model system to understand the earliest developmental stages of heart and blood development. “This sheds light on how blood cells naturally form during human embryogenesis, offering potential medical advances to screen drugs, study early blood and immune development, and model blood disorders like leukaemia,” said Neupane. The human stem cells used to grow the embryo-like structures can be created from any cell in the body. This means the approach could also pave the way for the production of blood that is fully compatible with a patient’s own body. Although other methods exist for generating human blood stem cells in the laboratory, these require a cocktail of extra proteins, whereas the new method mimics the natural developmental process in which self-organising structures drive the formation of different cell types. “Although it is still in the early stages, the ability to produce human blood cells in the lab marks a significant step towards future regenerative therapies – which use a patient’s own cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues,” said Prof Azim Surani at the Gurdon Institute, senior author of the paper. In this latest study, scientists used human stem cells to replicate some of the cells and structures that would typically appear in the third and fourth week of pregnancy. The model was specifically designed to lack the tissues that go on to form the placenta and yolk sac in a natural embryo, meaning that it did not have the theoretical potential of developing into a foetus and did not develop the tissues that would go on to form the brain. “This is a minimalistic system,” said Neupane. The team observed the emergence of the three-dimensional embryo-like structures under a microscope. By the second day, they had self-organised into three germ layers – called the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – the foundations of the human body plan. By day eight, beating heart cells had formed, the cells that eventually give rise to the heart in a developing human embryo. By day 13, the team saw red patches of blood appearing. Blood stem cells taken from the model were also shown to be able to differentiate into various blood cell types, including oxygen-carrying red blood cells and white blood cells that are crucial to the immune system.

a5f9a5cbcf53,"AI could make it harder to establish blame for medical failings, experts say",,"The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare could create a legally complex blame game when it comes to establishing liability for medical failings, experts have warned. The development of AI for clinical use has boomed, with researchers creating a host of tools, from algorithms to help interpret scans to systems that can aid with diagnoses . AI is also being developed to help manage hospitals, from optimising bed capacity to tackling supply chains. But while experts say the technology could bring myriad benefits for healthcare, they say there is also cause for concern, from a lack of testing of the effectiveness of AI tools to questions over who is responsible should a patient have a negative outcome. Prof Derek Angus, of the University of Pittsburgh, said: “There’s definitely going to be instances where there’s the perception that something went wrong and people will look around to blame someone.” The Jama summit on Artificial Intelligence, hosted last year by the Journal of the American Medical Association, brought together a panoply of experts including clinicians, technology companies, regulatory bodies, insurers, ethicists, lawyers and economists. The resulting report , of which Angus is first author, not only looks at the nature of AI tools and the areas of healthcare where they are being used, but also examines the challenges they present, including legal concerns. Prof Glenn Cohen from Harvard law school, a co-author of the report, said patients could face difficulties showing fault in the use or design of an artificial intelligence product. There could be barriers to gaining information about its inner workings, while it could also be challenging to propose a reasonable alternative design for the product or prove a poor outcome was caused by the AI system. He said: “The interplay between the parties may also present challenges for bringing a lawsuit – they may point to one another as the party at fault, and they may have existing agreement contractually reallocating liability or have indemnification lawsuits.” Prof Michelle Mello, another author of the report, from Stanford law school, said courts were well equipped to resolve legal issues. “The problem is that it takes time and will involve inconsistencies in the early days, and this uncertainty elevates costs for everyone in the AI innovation and adoption ecosystem,” she said. The report also raises concerns about how AI tools are evaluated, noting many are outside the oversight of regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Angus said: “For clinicians, effectiveness usually means improved health outcomes, but there’s no guarantee that the regulatory authority will require proof [of that]. Then once it’s out, AI tools can be deployed in so many unpredictable ways in different clinical settings, with different kinds of patients, by users who are of different levels of skills. There is very little guarantee that what seems to be a good idea in the pre-approval package is actually what you get in practice.” The report outlines that at present there are many barriers to evaluating AI tools including that they often need to be in clinical use to be fully assessed, while current approaches to assessment are expensive and cumbersome. Angus said it was important that funding was made available for the performance of AI tools in healthcare to be properly assessed, with investment in digital infrastructure a key area. “One of the things that came up during the summit was [that] the tools that are best evaluated have been least adopted. The tools that are most adopted have been least evaluated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/13/ai-tools-medical-health-liability-artificial-intelligence,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8b078db8c3d975b15ca1b697c805eaf608a192/230_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3432309c09a9bf3116ace71b709df3d",2025-10-13T15:00:03+00:00,a3e6000d408d82dc5184e032d9900de9e5f487f3
02c7c15c9a53,"High youth death rates are an ‘emerging crisis’, global health study warns",,"The world faces “an emerging crisis” of higher death rates among teenagers and young adults, according to a major study on the causes of death and disability worldwide. The reasons vary from drug and alcohol use, and suicide in North America, to infectious diseases and injuries in sub-Saharan Africa, the researchers said, but warned that their data should serve as “a wake-up call”. The study also found that chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes now accounted for two-thirds of all ill health and that mental health problems were surging. Half of the world’s disease burden was preventable, researchers calculated, driven by risks that could be reduced, such as high blood pressure, air pollution, smoking and obesity. The Global Burden of Disease study was carried out by a network of 16,500 scientists using more than 300,000 data sources. It is published in the Lancet and was presented at the World Health Summit in Berlin on Sunday. It found that, as of 2023, death rates had fallen overall in all 204 countries and territories, and global life expectancy had recovered from a dip caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. It stands at 76.3 years for women and 71.5 for men, more than 20 years higher than in 1950 – although “stark geographic differences” remain, ranging from 83 years in high-income regions to 62 in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the authors said they were particularly concerned about stubbornly higher or rising death rates among teenagers and young adults. In North America and parts of Latin America, the rises were driven by suicide and consumption of drugs and alcohol. “Very marked increases” among teenagers and young adults “certainly got our attention when we were looking at the data”, said Dr Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s school of medicine. Rising deaths in younger adults, particularly in North America, he said, were “very tied up with the rise of anxiety and depression in young people, particularly women”. While the rise of mental health disorders had received much attention, he said, there was still a lot of debate around the causes. “Is this social media? Is this [electronic] devices? Is this broader social trends on parenting? We know it was made worse by Covid. So there’s a lot of controversy, I’d say, in the psychiatric epidemiology and general social commentary about the causes around mental health. And so that’s a problem for coming up with solutions.” In sub-Saharan Africa, modelling advances revealed that deaths in children aged five to 14 since 1950 had been higher than previously thought, with drivers including infectious diseases and unintentional injuries. For girls and women aged 15 to 29, the death rate was 61% higher than previously estimated, mostly due to deaths in pregnancy or childbirth , road injuries and meningitis. Murray said: “The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and healthcare leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.” Dr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said that the 60% of people in Africa aged under 25 represented “an incredible potential”. “Health is the most powerful investment in this, and integrated care is the key, when we face the triple burden of cost of living, rising non-communicable diseases and communicable disease outbreaks, and climate change,” he said. “Siloed approaches to healthcare are failing our young people. Diseases like malaria, HIV and tuberculosis still claim too many young lives due to weak health systems, disrupted care and vaccine gaps. “At the same time, the exponential rise in non-communicable diseases among younger Africans is not just a future threat; they claim young lives daily, now. There is too little regulation of food production and scant nutrition education in urban environments that are changing lifestyles and outlooks.” He called for “stronger health systems founded on real youth-centred public health investment”. Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author and professor at IHME, warned that existing progress in low-income regions was at risk due to recent international aid cuts. She said: “These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.” The Global Burden of Disease study is partly funded by the Gates Foundation, which is a philanthropic organisation that also contributes funding to support the editorially independent global development section of the Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/12/global-burden-disease-study-high-youth-death-rates-drugs-alcohol-suicide-emerging-crisis,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c405f0f825754ee914ebdb7cddf255c094e680/428_0_4209_3367/master/4209.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30f3ffdae8d3d56f300da0dfd1bba53e",2025-10-12T14:00:54+00:00,ff73770b3e0a4686e5e9b8d741b188b0b90205e6
870c1eaf32ff,"Grisly recording reveals bat catching, killing and eating robin mid-flight",,"Bats are generally viewed as harmless, if spooky, creatures of the night. But scientists have revealed a more savage side, after witnessing a greater noctule bat – Europe’s largest bat species – hunting, killing and devouring a robin mid-flight. The grisly recording reveals the bat as a formidable predator, climbing to 1.2km (4,000ft) before embarking on a breakneck-speed dive in pursuit of its prey. On capture, the bat delivered a lethal bite and subsequent chewing sounds, recorded between echolocation calls, indicated that the bat consumed the bird continuously during flight for 23 minutes without losing altitude. “It’s fascinating that bats are not only able to catch them, but also to kill and eat them while flying,” said Dr Laura Stidsholt, a co-author of the research based at Aarhus University. “A bird like that weighs about half as much as the bat itself – it would be like me catching and eating a 35-kilo animal while jogging.” Billions of birds seasonally migrate at night and over long distances at high altitude and their flight paths are known to intersect with bat hunting grounds. Dr Carlos Ibáñez, of the Doñana Biological Station, Seville, first made the case that birds were an important food resource during the pre-hibernation – autumn – and gestation – spring – periods after observing feathers in bat faeces 25 years ago. Other scientists were sceptical, however, and in the intervening years Ibáñez and colleagues have deployed surveillance cameras, military radar and ultrasound recorders attached to hot air balloons in a quest for smoking gun evidence. In the latest study, greater noctule bats were taken from nesting boxes in southern Spain and fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing instruments to record acceleration, altitude and audio, including echolocation calls. The data revealed two instances of bats mounting attacks on migratory birds, one of which was successful. This bat was observed to climb to an altitude of 1.2km, before encountering its prey. “The bat is flying in stealth mode,” said Stidsholt. “It’s night-time, the bird can’t see it coming, it can’t hear the echolocation sounds. The bat has an advantage.” On close approach – perhaps alerted by the bat’s wingbeats or its shadow – the bird suddenly entered a downward spiral. The bat was observed to follow in a cat-and-mouse chase covering more than 1km, during which the microphone recorded 21 distress calls from the robin. As the pair approached ground level, a final shriek was heard from the robin, followed by 23 minutes of chewing sounds from the bat as it continued to fly at low altitude. “From a human perspective, I didn’t feel good about it,” said Stidsholt. “But, on the other hand, the bat is a very rare species and it isn’t doing very well in southern Europe due to droughts and wild fires so we want this species to have a good meal.” Previously, Ibáñez had collected, and stored in a freezer, severed songbird wings found under bats’ hunting grounds. X-ray imaging and DNA analysis of 11 wings suggested that the bats bite off and discard the wings – probably to reduce weight and drag. The researchers believe that the bats then stretch the membrane between their hind legs forward like a pouch, allowing them to eat the rest of the bird mid-flight. Elena Tena, of Doñana Biological Station and a lead author of the study, said: “While it evokes empathy for the prey, it is part of nature.” The findings are published in the journal Science .",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/09/grisly-recording-reveals-bat-catching-killing-and-eating-robin-mid-flight,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c8d739be2a5d170aa9302dad21a243816ad81c1/0_1275_3456_2765/master/3456.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d2ee020c01d8432ec9f9a43e47654b8",2025-10-09T18:00:30+00:00,49a8e52c169f906e491746a09adfd90014a0cc6b
4e12552fdbd3,Dogs name toys while elephants name each other. Animal language is more complex than we imagine,,"Another day, another cute story about how dogs can grasp elements of human language and use them to communicate with us. First, there was Mr Waffles, the Yorkshire terrier that“talks” to his owners by pressing electronic buttons that have been pre-programmed with words and phrases. In one of his videos , viewed more than half a million times, the pint-sized pooch stares defiantly at the camera and responds to an empty packet of treats by pressing the “I don’t give a damn” button. Followed by the “bitch” button. Bad dog, Mr Waffles. Then, last month, researchers reported that some dogs can mentally categorise their toys depending on their use. “Fetch toys” can be distinguished from “tug of war toys”, and retrieved appropriately. I’m a dog owner. I fully admit to being one of the third of Britons who would rather talk to their pets than to people. At first glance, the study seems to confirm what I already knew – that my dog understands everything that I say – but while interactions like this tell us something about how smart dogs are, they barely scrape the surface of their communicative abilities. In recent years, many parallels have been drawn between animal communication and human language. We have learned, for example, that some animals have names that they use for each other. Elephants use particular vocalisations – harmonically rich, low-frequency sounds – to address key members of their group. “Hey, Dave, over here!” In their early months of life, bottlenose dolphins invent their own unique “ signature whistle ”, which goes on to become the name that others use to call them. During this same time period, mother dolphins communicate with their youngsters using “ motherese ”. Just like human mums, they adjust the frequency and pitch of the sounds they make to a create a singsong tone thought to facilitate bonding. Meanwhile, songbirds have different regional dialects , meaning the sparrows near me sing with the avian equivalent of a Birmingham accent – “All right, bab!” And sperm whales, which use “names” and accents, have recently been shown to have their own phonetic alphabet . The gentle giants communicate with patterns of clicks. By altering their rhythm, tempo, duration and number, simple units of sound can be combined to generate complexity. According to the scientists who discovered the phenomenon, this is similar to the way that humans combine sounds to form words. Whenever these stories break, they are met with surprise. “Aren’t animals clever?! Who’d have thought it?!” But none of this should be surprising. All of these animals live deeply complex, rich and social lives. Sperm whales, for example, live in tight-knit female-led groups , which sometimes come together to form larger groups known as “ vocal clans ”. They hunt together, babysit for each other and work together to see off predatory orcas. Of course they have complex communication. They need it for survival. The mistake, however, is to presume – a priori – that animal communication is anything like ours. All too often we try to crowbar animal communication into a human-centric framework, but it’s like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. We’ll never solve the puzzle, because there will always be a fundamental mismatch. Just as a cuttlefish would miss the subtlety of human sarcasm, so too humans are unlikely ever to understand the full spectrum of cuttlefish communication. When they dynamically change the patterning and colour of their skin, it’s fascinating, but alien. Different animals communicate in different ways. Sure they use sound, but they also use colour, smell, electricity , vibrations and the medium of expressive dance . There is an abundance of animal communication that we miss because we don’t have the sensory organs or humility to detect it. Human language – with names and words and syntax and grammar – is just one solution that one species has evolved to help it navigate the challenges that it faces. Non-human animals live different lives with different struggles. If we really want to grasp what animals are “saying”, we need to understand their communication on their terms, not ours. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Through careful observation, she uncovered a wealth of previously unrecognised complexity, including the discovery that chimps communicate using body language as well as sound. Contemporary ethologists have built on this. The work of Cat Hobaiter from the University of St Andrews shows that chimps have a rich repertoire of gestures that they use for close-up communication. They don’t have “words” , but they do have flexible articulate signals that have meaning. So, when a chimp makes an audibly loud, long, slow scratch, it can mean “groom me”, but it can also mean “let’s travel”. And while they may not have specific gestures or calls for different types of food, such as figs or seeds, maybe they don’t need them. What humans and chimps consider useful information is different. So, instead of marvelling at the ability of pooches to press word buttons, take time instead to marvel at the way dogs communicate with dogs.

ac9ac23816d5,"In the age of false information, we all need a good BS detector. Here’s how to sort facts from harmful fiction",,"E rnest Hemingway famously said that every good writer needs a built-in BS detector. But in 2025 we all need one. High levels of scientific misinformation are threatening the wellbeing of families and our society, and the problem is worsening at an alarming rate. Artificial intelligence and social media are turbocharging the spread of misinformation dressed as science. Lies that once travelled slowly, and stayed relatively local, now surge across the globe. When people share mistruths – for example, about vaccines, paracetamol or clean energy – the consequences are real and sometimes tragic. Preventable diseases such as measles are now returning to Australian communities because of unfounded fears about vaccines. Misinformation is false or misleading information. Sometimes it’s spread by people who deliberately lie about the facts; this is referred to as disinformation. And sometimes it’s spread by those who just don’t know better. Either way, it is becoming more pervasive and more corrosive at all levels. At a personal level, bad information can damage your health, lead to poor financial decisions, and undermine your ability to make informed choices. At a societal level, it erodes trust in institutions, poisons public debate, and pushes people to extremes. Ultimately, misinformation makes it harder to agree on facts, harder to work together to solve shared problems, and undermines the social cohesion and democratic resilience that Australians value. The good news? There are simple steps we can take to combat misinformation – especially if we understand why we are susceptible to it. Australia’s top science advisory body to the prime minister – the National Science and Technology Council – last year commissioned landmark reports on misinformation. As a member of that council, I look forward to their release later this year. The reports explore why individuals and communities are vulnerable to misinformation, and what can be done to build resilience. The reports show we can be vulnerable to misinformation because of the way our brains are wired. Research finds humans are naturally inclined to believe new information – especially if it’s simple, familiar, or comes from people we trust. The more we see it, the more credible it seems, even if it’s false. Poor physical or mental health can also reduce cognitive capacity, increasing susceptibility to falsehoods. When faced with large volumes of information, we often rely on mental shortcuts. While they help us process the information quickly, they can backfire – especially when the information is emotional, threatening or comes from like-minded people. We’re more likely to believe it if it aligns with our existing views or comes from someone we trust. In light of our brain’s wiring, when confronted with new information we need to pause and ask: is this the best information I can get? Would it stand up to scientific scrutiny? Did it come from someone using the scientific method – a way of rigorously testing ideas through observation, hypothesis and experiment – or just from someone I follow online? You don’t need to be a scientist to spot good science. If in doubt, look for scientific consensus – the collective agreement of experts that is based on accumulated evidence. It is built through repeated testing, peer review and open debate. Peer review – where scientists scrutinise each other’s work – helps detect and correct errors. It’s not perfect, but it’s robust. For example, early in the Covid pandemic, scientists initially underestimated the impact of airborne transmission. But peer-reviewed studies quickly corrected that understanding, leading to updated health advice. That is science working as it should. Trusting science isn’t about having blind faith in scientists. It’s trust in the scientific method: predict, test, observe, refine. Science questions everything, and while it doesn’t claim perfection, it offers the best knowledge we have at any given time. It’s not the only source of truth, but it’s a damn good one. Almost every element of modern life – including the device you’re reading this on – is built on knowledge gained through the scientific method. Sorting through information in real time is hard. If we’re not confident doing that sorting alone, we’re lucky in Australia to have organisations – like the CSIRO, our universities, museums, hospitals, and health and environment departments – that can provide the best available information. We need to cherish those institutions , especially when we face significant challenges, even if the best available information evolves over time. In addition to those institutions, education and civic engagement can also play a crucial part in sandbagging our communities against a tide of falsehoods. Some BS is easy to sniff out – cancer cure scams, flat earth nonsense and evolution denial. Other misinformation is harder to detect but just as dangerous, so we must be extremely vigilant because the stakes are extremely high. Our collective wellbeing depends on our capacity to distinguish credible science from persuasive fiction. It depends on our willingness to think critically, seek reliable proof from credible sources, and keep our BS detectors switched on.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/08/in-the-age-of-false-information-we-all-need-a-good-bs-detector-heres-how-to-sort-facts-from-harmful-fiction,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7810296e0f9433779b2820699fd5c594aed354be/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=731aa5a8e8f06ef0392667437246af8d",2025-10-07T22:41:10+00:00,8658680a6fa6ef42b66ea1c981087198a08f3158
32257f3cb8fe,"Finland is ready for the next crisis, with stockpiled food and 72-hour kits – Europe should be too",,"I n times of crisis, food is more than sustenance. It is a pillar of national stability. Finland has long understood this, not just because of policy, but because of who we are and where we live. Geography, a mild continental climate and our history have shaped a mindset where preparedness is essential. In a country with vast territory, a sparse population and long distances between communities, resilience must be built into everything we do. This understanding is deeply rooted in our society, in individual households as much as government institutions. Today, Finland’s approach to preparedness is rightly seen as a model for Europe . But it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. What works for Finland, such as our high levels of food self-sufficiency, strong institutions and a culture of cooperation, may not work elsewhere. Still, our experience offers valuable lessons. Preparedness must be proactive, inclusive and deeply integrated into national strategy. My job at the National Emergency Supply Agency (Nesa) means I spend much of my time thinking about what could go wrong – and more importantly, how we can make Finland ready for when it does. Whether we face a pandemic, cyber-attack or geopolitical shock, our job is to ensure the country can continue to function, feed itself and protect its people. The Covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have shown how fragile global systems can be. One of the cornerstones of our national resilience is the strategic grain reserve system. These reserves include wheat, oats, barley and rye, grains that are central to both our agriculture and our diet. Stored in secure facilities across the country, they are rotated using the Fifo (first in, first out) method to maintain quality and ensure older grains are used before newer ones. These reserves are designed to sustain the population for nine months in the event of a global supply-chain collapse or domestic production disruption. During the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, they have helped reassure the public. Finland’s food self-sufficiency rate is around 80%. That means we produce most of the food we consume, which is a rare achievement in today’s interconnected world. This is thanks to our farmers, who operate more than 40,000 farms nationwide. In 2024, crop production was the main activity on 74% of farms, while livestock farming was practised on 20%. The average farm size is 56 hectares. Despite a short growing season and a limited variety of crops, our agricultural sector is efficient, innovative and supported by strong infrastructure. These farms are the backbone of our food system and their role in national security cannot be overstated. A tractor harrowing farmland in Lieto, Finland. Photograph: Jarmo Piironen/Alamy We have even developed our own rapeseed cultivar, Aurea CL , specifically suited to the Nordic climate. It helps ensure that domestically produced rapeseed oil and protein-rich feed remain available even during times of crisis. This kind of innovation reflects our long-term commitment to resilience. But preparedness is not just about stockpiles and production. It is about systems that can adapt and continue to function under stress. Finland’s food supply chain is resilient by design. The government works closely with producers, processors, retailers and logistics companies to ensure continuity. Emergency plans are in place to reroute deliveries and prioritise essential goods. We also maintain emergency fuel reserves to keep agricultural machinery and food transport running during crises. A key part of our strategy is public-private partnerships. At Nesa, we collaborate with companies across the food sector, from grain mills to supermarket chains. Together, we develop contingency plans, run joint exercises and share information. This cooperation is not just policy. It is the way things are done. Businesses understand their role in national preparedness and take it seriously. Preparedness also starts at home. In Finland, household-level readiness is essential. One of our most effective tools is the 72-hour model, which encourages every household to be self-sufficient: to have enough food and bottled water (five litres per person) for three days. We advise having a stock of dry foods that keep well, such as nuts or dried fruit. Our home emergency supply kit checklist includes such items as a first aid kit, iodine tablets, a battery-powered radio, torch, power bank, portable stove, toilet paper and duct tape. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

28e2ad9a049f,The Guardian view on Merck’s exit: Britain’s biopharma strategy stalls in the face of China’s rise,,"W hen Merck abruptly scrapped its billion-pound London research hub last week, critics blamed Britain’s lacklustre support for life sciences and a Scrooge-like grip on NHS drug prices. But one important factor may have been missed. That Merck, which is also cutting jobs elsewhere – 6,000 globally – is recalibrating not just in response to the UK or the US, but to China. Merck’s cash cow is pembrolizumab (brand name Keytruda ), an immunotherapy drug launched in 2014 that has successfully treated advanced melanoma, head and neck, lung, cervical and other cancers. It blocks an antibody called PD-1, teaching the immune system to fight the cancer. Because some patients are out of other options, the results sometimes seem miraculous. But Keytruda’s patent runs out in 2028. And now there is another drug on the global market, called ivonescimab, made by Akeso Biopharma. In head-to-head trials, reported in the Lancet journal in March, the innovative Chinese drug, which hits an additional tumour target, outperformed Merck’s – and it’s cheaper. The World Health Organization now lists PD-1 drugs as essential medicines worldwide, with no special status for Keytruda. No wonder Merck is cutting costs. Experts warn that this is no flash in the pan. Both treatments are products of a shift in the technology from pharma to biopharma. The former delivered mass-market drugs; the latter produces bespoke, high‑cost therapies. Richard Sullivan, professor of cancer and global health at King’s College London, and Lewis Husain, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, wrote earlier this year that China, once seen as a follower, is now emerging as a global leader in cutting-edge biopharmaceutical treatments, reshaping the competitive landscape. The closure of Merck’s UK research centre, with the loss of 125 scientist positions, is another setback for the government’s biopharma ambitions. AstraZeneca has already scrapped vaccine research expansion in Liverpool. In an interview with the BBC, Sir John Bell , Oxford’s former regius professor of medicine, said industry bosses had told him that they see Britain as a poor bet. They demand more subsidies, higher drug-price caps and fast NHS approval for expensive new biopharma treatments. Yet these niche therapies benefit only a small number of patients, and higher spending on them inevitably leaves less for everyone else’s healthcare. Donald Trump is setting the mood music, demanding drug firms make their medicines in the US. Merck, known as MSD in Europe but headquartered in New Jersey, will be looking to oblige. The nominally Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, which followed Merck by announcing it was “pausing” a £200m research expansion in Cambridge, in July pledged to spend £37bn on research and development and manufacturing in the US by 2030. But this is a global industry. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche and GSK are among the big players now doing deals to develop new Chinese drugs. Countries will buy the best medicines they can afford, which may be Chinese. Britain can’t just rely on price caps and vague industrial strategy promises. It needs to examine how rivals structure their incentives, regulation and support – and then decide where it can compete. That doesn’t mean simply inflating the NHS drugs bill, but targeting strengths. With the US retreating from mRNA – the platform behind the most widespread Covid vaccines – Britain has a rare opening.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-mercks-exit-britains-biopharma-strategy-stalls-in-the-face-of-chinas-rise,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8556237f181d1ed43a6512335fc61b7f430df3e6/623_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c0c747f05ccd483d71c51af3f85acf5a",2025-09-15T17:45:39+00:00,c77fa9cbe38d05bb09639fe963c8eddbb28cb2f5

677a641c3de4,Friday briefing: The Huntington’s treatment is a ray of light for victims of a brutal disease,,"Good morning. Few medical diagnoses are as brutal and devastating as Huntington’s disease. For decades, those who inherited this cruel condition faced only despair. There was no cure. Symptoms began with mood swings and depression, then progressed to a loss of movement, followed by dementia, paralysis and, ultimately, death. Some patients died within a decade of diagnosis. Finally, a ray of light has burst through. For the first time, Huntington’s disease has been treated successfully through gene therapy, slowing the progress of the disease by 75% in patients after three years in a groundbreaking trial. It is one of several extraordinary medical advances announced in recent months, alongside new possible treatments and diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. For today, I spoke with Hannah Devlin, the Guardian’s science correspondent, about the exciting research behind this desperately needed good news, and why cuts to scientific research could put future progress at risk. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories France | The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been found guilty of criminal conspiracy , and given a five-year prison sentence. UK politics | All working adults will need digital ID cards under plans to be announced by Keir Starmer , in a move that will spark a battle with civil liberties campaigners. Middle East | The White House is backing a plan that would see Tony Blair head a temporary administration of the Gaza Strip – initially without the direct involvement of the Palestinian Authority (PA), according to Israeli media reports. US news | James Comey, the former FBI director and one of Donald Trump’s most frequent targets, was indicted on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, in the latest move in the president’s retribution campaign against his political adversaries. UK news | The crown court backlog in England and Wales has hit a new record of almost 80,000 cases , while wait times for trial dates have reached up to four years. In depth: ‘Symptoms in the prime of your life’ Cells in the brain of a person with Huntington’s disease. Photograph: AP Huntington’s disease is a genetic disease that runs through families. It is caused by a single mutation of a gene that makes a protein called huntingtin. Huntingtin is an essential protein in the brain, but in people who have the mutation, the brain makes a toxic version of it that kills brain cells, Hannah Devlin told me. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people in the UK have the diseases, and another 20,000 are carriers of the faulty gene, which means they are likely to develop it. “If you’ve got the gene, you tend to get your first symptoms in the prime of your life – in your 30s and 40s. Then you’ll undergo a mental decline, which is a form of dementia, as well as motor issues; including jerky movements, losing your balance and gradually becoming paralysed,” Hannah said. “It’s a truly devastating condition, and one of the really awful things about it is if you’re a gene carrier, your children will have a 50% chance of also having the gene.” Over the last 10 years, Hannah has reported on notable progress in the scientific community’s understanding of how the mutant gene causes the disease. She said: “There has been growing hope that a treatment was on the horizon, but practically, there hasn’t been anything for patients. Until now.” A one-off injection The successful trial used gene therapy to silence the mutant gene so the brain stops producing the toxic protein. The challenge for researchers was overcoming the blood-brain barrier. “While drugs can flow around the body, the brain has a special barrier that stops that from happening. So getting any treatment into the brain is itself a massive hurdle,” Hannah said. The breakthrough treatment worked by delivering a small piece of genetic material attached to a harmless virus. Scientists infused the virus directly into the brain. Once inside, the virus entered neurons and delivered the genetic material that silences the mutant gene, stopping it from producing the toxic protein. The procedure is incredibly complex and delicate, Hannah said. “You have to infuse this virus into the brain very slowly, over 12 to 20 hours, through microcatheters put into the two brain areas that are most affected by Huntington’s.” She added that this gene therapy unit is remarkable because it is effectively a one-off injection. “So they had the surgery, had this treatment delivered once, and then they were followed up for three years to see whether it altered the progress of the disease.” The research shows that the gene therapy slowed the progress of the disease by 75% in patients after three years. Ripple of activity While political leaders appear intent on delivering doom and gloom, the scientific community seems determined to do the opposite. The breakthrough treatment for Huntington’s disease is the latest in a string of remarkable advances, including promising new therapies and diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. “We have seen some really exciting developments in Alzheimer’s, including the approval of a couple of exciting drugs that could slow progression of the disease. They’re not currently funded by the NHS , but it’s been seen as a big development,” Hannah said. She also pointed to notable breakthroughs in how Alzheimer’s is diagnosed, including a £100 blood test and a three-minute brain scan , which medics hope could transform diagnosis of the devastating condition. These diagnostics could be critical to getting a much faster diagnosis, which is crucial to treating the disease. “Often when one breakthrough happens, it prompts this ripple of activity and things can suddenly move quite fast in an area where it feels like there was very little progress for years,” Hannah told me. The other big developments recently have been in treatments for heart disease and stroke. Researchers found that a blood-thinning drug could be more effective at preventing heart attacks and stroke than aspirin, which has been the standard for decades. “A lot of this is off the back of big investments into health research,” Hannah said, but that now appears under threat in some corners of the globe. A bright future, dimmed The breakthrough in treating Huntington’s disease would not have happened without public funding. “This is work that has been going on for more than a decade at UCL [University College London]. This is an absolutely world-leading team that has benefited from public funding into how to study this awful disease. It’s now being fast-tracked in the United States because of this incredible reputation that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] has with speed and their links with the research community,” Hannah said. But that is now under threat. There have already been major staff layoffs at the FDA , as well as a proposed cut of more than 40% to the National Institutes of Health budget amid what has been called an “assault on science” by the Trump administration. And as I explored in my previous first edition on the impact of US cuts on vaccine research, these decisions will be felt across the world . “If you fast forward 10 years, some of the research that’s been cut will translate into fewer treatments that could help with some of these really awful diseases. In some cases, researchers are just on the cusp of being able to treat some really devastating diseases so it does feel depressing that these cuts are happening in parallel,” Hannah said. Time will tell whether other countries or global institutions step in to fill the gap left by the US. Until then, I’ll be here to deliver these happy First Editions, only tempered by a bit of caution at the end. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Something for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now An arch schemer whose currency is violence … James Norton in House of Guinness Photograph: Ben Blackall/Netflix/PA TV House of Guinness | ★★★★★ The family here is not a crime family: we are in Dublin in 1868, where Guinness is so ubiquitous that the unimaginably wealthy Guinness family run the city. But managing the factory that dominates the landscape is the fearsome Sean Rafferty (James Norton), an arch schemer whose currency is violence. He introduces himself by issuing a rallying call to the company workers, exhorting them to crush an anti-Guinness street protest then leading the way himself, gleefully swinging a hunk of hard factory iron. Jack Seale Music Olivia Dean: The Art of Loving | ★★★★☆ Dean’s 2023 debut album, Messy , attracted respectful but mixed reviews and did respectable, rather than remarkable, business. While you wouldn’t describe The Art of Loving as a complete reinvention, it certainly constitutes a noticeable rethink. It expunges most of the cliches of Dean’s debut – or rather quarantines them on a track called Close Up – and instead looks for inspiration to music that emanated from recording studios in 70s LA. Alexis Petridis Film Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror | ★★★☆☆ Andreas Zerr’s unofficial documentary charts the 50-year cult of Richard O’Brien’s beloved classic, from its chaotic early days upstairs at the Royal Court theatre. With archival footage, and cast, fans and producers among the talking heads, it shows how a “shitty fucking movie” became an accidental phenomenon that imitators could never match. Catherine Bray Theatre Measure for Measure (Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avo n) | ★★★★★ Emily Burns’s razor-sharp revival cuts away the comic subplots to deliver a tense, streamlined account of Shakespeare’s play about sexual hypocrisy and power .

c7dd47db94db,Can you solve it? The London cab that rode into history,,"Around 1919, the British mathematician G. H. Hardy hopped on a London cab on his way to visit his Indian colleague Srinivasa Ramanujan. The cab’s licence number, 1729, seemed dull to Hardy but his pal fervently disagreed. “It is a very interesting number,” said Ramanujan. “It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” 1729 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 9 3 + 10 3 Hardy’s anecdote is one of the most well-told in British mathematics, and has given rise to taxicab number, which is any number that is the smallest number expressible as sums of two cubes in n different ways. It is also why the UK’s first specialist maths secondary school, which opens in London in September next year, will be called the 1729 Maths School. Today’s puzzles are loosely based on 1729, apart from the one that isn’t. 1. Square pair What is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of a pair of squares in two different ways? Hint: it is less than 100 2. Strip tease I have five strips of wood with lengths 1, 2, 7, 17 and 29 centimetres. It is impossible to arrange any three of these strips into a triangle. I would like to add another strip of wood so that I still cannot take three strips and make a triangle. How many different lengths are possible for the seventh strip, and what are they? Lengths must be a whole number of centimetres. As a bonus, what shape can I make using only these hypothetical extra strips? CLARIFICATION: 29cm is the maximum length. And no two lengths can be the same. UPDATE: There was an error in this problem. Now the 9 has been deleted it works. 3. Sick sixth I have four numbers, a, b, c, and d. There are six ways to multiply two of these numbers together: ab, cd, ac, bd, ad, bc. The values of five of these products, but not necessarily in this order, are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. What is the value of the sixth product? I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the answers. PLEASE NO SPOILERS. Instead discuss London taxis. UPDATE: Read the answers here. The UK currently has nine “university maths schools”, which are sixth form colleges focussed on maths and maths-aligned subjects. They aim to nurture top mathematical talent from underrepresented groups. The 1729 Maths School will be the first maths school for pupils from the age of 11 (year 7). It will be based in the campus of Mill Hill School, an independent school in north London. Its first cohorts, years 7 and 9, will have eighteen and ten pupils. The school is backed by the maths philanthropists Alex Gerko and his wife Elena, whose fortune comes from the algorithmic trading firm XTX Markets. Bursaries will be offered to pupils unable to pay the fees. Applications are now open for years 7 and 9 (for children currently in years 6 and 8). The deadline is October 31.

7e1d6933b52d,Did you solve it? The simple T-puzzle that fools everyone (at first!),,"Earlier today I set you a classic 19th century puzzle The T-puzzle Rearrange the four pieces to make a T. The pieces cannot overlap and must fit in to the given template. Flipping pieces is allowed. For an interactive version click here. For a printable version click here Scroll below for the answer. (I didnt want to put the solution high on the page, just in case you haven’t seen it before and want to try it out first on this interactive app .) You can move the pieces with your thumb/mouse and rotate them by clicking, or pressing the buttons. The third button is for flips. The T-puzzle is simple, a primary school standard, and yet challenging to many. According to this research paper , out of five undergraduates given the puzzle the fastest took 2mins 20, the second about 9mins and the other three more than 15mins (and required a hint.) The interactive app, created by reader Phoebe Fletcher, has a timer and I was interested to see how you all got on. The stats Number who gave it a go: 24,256 Number who solved it: 9,650 (39.8 per cent) Fastest time. 6s Slowest time: 52m 46s Median time: 1m 57s Mean time: 3m 6s The 6 second response was I’m sure by someone who had seen the puzzle before, although I am extremely impressed by their nimble fingers. The 52 minute response might have been someone who fell asleep. The median, at just under two minutes, is about the same as the fastest undergraduate in the academic paper, which makes me think that the paper is more or less correct. Of those who can get it, it comes quite quickly – but for many people it really is quite tough. And now for the solution. The key insight is that the pentagonal piece must be diagonal. People who fail to solve it assume that it must be placed vertically or horizontal. I hope you enjoyed the puzzle and I’ll be back in two weeks.

70e2659ce487,Who’s to blame for the NHS’s blame culture?,,"Jeremy Hunt’s article ( Here’s the direct effect of our NHS blame culture: babies die. Tragedy after tragedy, it can’t go on, 9 October ) will be welcome to many, especially those healthcare professionals who have had to endure the intimidating mistrust and adversarial working culture he describes. What is missing from his account is the seminal role of government’s NHS reforms in creating these problems. In particular, the creation, then proliferation, of commercialised and competing autarkic NHS trusts and outside providers over many years. This has generated a growing culture of corporate defensiveness and reputation anxiety. Within such conditions, practitioners then adapt to behave much like employees in large commercial organisations – they must show compliance, “loyalty”, conformity and seamless performance, albeit speciously. This tendency has increased with every reform over the last 40 years; each has carried forward a neoliberal agenda – both Labour and Conservative governments have devised policies and managements to assure this. The currently vaunted 10-year plan will merely entrench the problems Jeremy Hunt has otherwise so adroitly observed and understood. Dr David Zigmond Executive committee, Doctors for the NHS Jeremy Hunt rightly points to the reluctance of healthcare workers to admit when errors have been made, and praises the example of a midwife meeting the father of a baby who died, where she expressed remorse and wished she had acted differently. This honesty led to forgiveness and improved confidence that lessons had been learned. It strikes me that, in general, politicians are similarly reluctant to admit when they get it wrong. Jeremy Hunt’s imposition in 2015 of a new contract on junior doctors (now called resident doctors) was on the false premise that if they could be forced to work more at weekends this would reduce delayed treatments and discharges. He failed to recognise that this simplistic solution would also require ancillary services – investigations, physiotherapy, social work – to be fully funded and operational seven days a week. The resulting doctors’ strike and subsequent imposition of the contract caused huge resentment. Perhaps it is a case of “politician, heal thyself”? Dr Richard Sloan Retired palliative medicine consultant, Dorchester, Dorset Jeremy Hunt’s comments are well meaning but not original, and he had adequate opportunity to change the system. The most significant call to end the blame culture was by Prof Donald Berwick 25 years ago in his seminal publication To Err Is Human. The Department of Health then published An Organisation With a Memory , which spelled out constructive error management, but in the NHS Patient Safety Strategy of 2019 (after Hunt had been health secretary for six years), it was stated that we need to do more to change the culture. Let’s hope the 10-year plan will help to deliver that change through making it easier for patients and public to speak up. Dr Eric Watts Former chair, Doctors for the NHS While I agree with Jeremy Hunt’s view on promoting a no-blame culture, implementing that is easier said than done. It is not just litigation that acts as an impediment to learning. Other factors such as complaints processes, coroners’ inquests (which have become increasingly adversarial) and even the threat of referral to professional bodies all act as a deterrent to a culture of openness and self-reflection.

b70b0feb82cf,Don’t give in to big pharma on drug pricing,,"While the chief executive of Eli Lilly may lament the UK’s drug prices ( UK is ‘worst country in Europe’ for drug prices, says Mounjaro maker, 24 September ), the NHS should celebrate them. The system put in place for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new drugs is respected the world over and is successful in applying the principle that funding a new product should not damage the NHS as a whole. This principle of cost-effectiveness has led to widespread price reductions for the NHS that have allowed the service as a whole to benefit. The chief executive of Eli Lilly links the recent pausing or cancelling of pharmaceutical industry investments in the UK to drug pricing here, when these are down to the drug companies’ desperation to kowtow to Donald Trump . Further to this, the talk of increasing Nice’s cost-effectiveness threshold, and even index-linking this, is a disgrace ( NHS could pay 25% more for medicines under plan to end row with drugmakers and Trump, 8 October ). The threshold is not a price that we should increase every year; it is a measure of opportunity cost. It measures what health improvements in the wider NHS we miss out on when we invest more in a new service or drug. If a new drug doesn’t generate more “health” than that which it displaces, the NHS as a whole is worse off. The rate of displacement doesn’t directly change with inflation. Linking the two is nonsense.

Even if the mentally ill person had recovered, one in 10 people said they would be unwilling to live next to them, according to new research from the mental health charity Mind. The survey, by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, found that only 63% of people were comfortable about mental health services operating in their community instead of in psychiatric units, down from 70% in 2015. The figures showed that 14% of people were frightened of those with poor mental health living in their neighbourhoods, up from 8% in 2017, while 16% of people believed mental health services “downgraded” a neighbourhood, up from 10% in 2019. The number of respondents who agreed that being part of a community was the best therapy for people with mental health problems was the lowest since the research was first conducted in 2008, at 68%. Dr Sarah Hughes, the chief executive of Mind, said: “The rise in stigma is alarming. We have seen a change in language, people telling us their family’s attitudes are changing, as well as increasing narratives around benefit claimants and some very difficult and terrible instances of violence linked to mental illness – it feels like a lot of things have come home to roost.” She said the charity was “hearing from mental health services who are getting challenges from neighbours like frequent complaints, objections in planning applications or operating in inhospitable environments”. The survey also showed a significant drop in the number of people who – correctly – believe people with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or psychosis, can fully recover. The figure stood at 67% in 2019, and is now 53%. Prof Claire Henderson from the IoPPN said the survey showed that although people’s attitudes towards specific individuals with mental illness had improved, their attitudes towards mental illness generally had declined “back to baseline”. She said recent high-profile criminal cases involving perpetrators with mental illness, such as Valdo Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia and fatally stabbed three people in Nottingham in 2023, could have increased stigmatisation. “There is this fear about people who are visibly unwell, and there has been a push to more coercive care, whereas really it’s about having the resources to be able to respond to people when they are in crisis,” she said. “But if you have a neighbour who’s very unwell and not getting treated, or if you’re on the bus and somebody is yelling for no clear reason and you’re with small children, people worry. It’s not fair just to say that people are ignorant or prejudiced.” She said difficulty accessing services was adding to pessimism about whether therapy worked. “We asked people: ‘Can medication work? Do people recover?’ And if you don’t see that happening, then you will not answer positively to those questions,” she said. Henderson said a growing “negative discourse about young people with mental health problems” was “trivialising” some conditions, and feeding misconceptions about benefit claimants. The findings were released as part of Mind’s annual Big Mental Health report, which found there were 1.66 million people waiting for community mental health care in England and Wales in the third quarter of 2024-25. Jenny Tan, 22, a psychology student who waited years to receive treatment for anorexia, said she had faced stigma and unfriendliness when disclosing her mental ill health. “There are so many more celebrities now coming forward and talking about this. I thought society was a lot more accommodating, a lot more understanding,” she said. “But when people think of mental illness, they stereotypically think of disorders that are presented as being dangerous in the media, things which have been associated with violence. “But I think if people actually understood what it was like to have a mental health condition, their reaction would not be disgust and running away.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/15/alarming-rise-in-mental-health-stigma-in-england-research-shows,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fed70324b519a3d53a7cf06e885cf965780065a/812_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a44f4efaa439d6ffb06b80228018f66",2025-10-15T15:00:39+00:00,b844bd06856c11addbafd8c200b67b89992a219c
ef4d97970ad6,Nursing unions call for UK to back prosecutions for war crimes against health workers,,"War crimes targeting health workers, patients and facilities should be prioritised for international criminal prosecution, senior nursing and medical leaders have urged. The number of health workers killed annually in conflicts has jumped five-fold in less than a decade, and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and British Medical Association (BMA) have called for action from the UK government to fully back international criminal court (ICC) prosecutions of perpetrators. There were 175 health worker killings in conflict in 2016, rising to 932 in 2024, according to a new report from the RCN’s International Nursing Academy, using data from Insecurity Insights. The data is subject to a lengthy cross-checking process and likely to rise – for example, its initial report on 2023 included 143 health worker killings in Palestine, a figure which had risen to 414 by the time of their 2024 report. Deaths in Palestine , Ukraine and Lebanon accounted for a significant rise since 2023, and there have been corresponding rises in health worker arrests and attacks on health facilities. There have already been more than 1,200 attacks on health workers recorded by Insecurity Insight this year, a total expected to climb due to delayed reporting. “Any killing of any member of nursing staff, in any context or for any reason, is entirely abhorrent,” said Prof Nicola Ranger, general secretary and chief executive of the RCN. “The UK government must do everything in its power to support the upholding of international law, including supporting the ICC to investigate and prosecute those responsible.” Dr Andrew Green, chair of the British Medical Association’s ethics committee, said: “When states and armed groups break international humanitarian law with attacks on the wounded and sick, health facilities and health workers, they must be held to account, and governments around the world, including our own, all have a part to play in that process.” Ranger said attacks on health systems left deep and lasting scars on communities, and placed them under immense strain as they sought to deal with widespread civilian injuries and escalating public health needs. She also called for UK overseas aid spending to be restored to 0.7% of GDP “to support the rebuilding of devastated health systems across the globe”.

Photograph: Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images The report, Care Amongst the Chaos , includes testimony from six nurses and a midwife working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon and Myanmar. Asmaan, a nurse from Afghanistan said she and her colleagues faced intimidation and were unable to offer high-quality care. “Most villages have no hospitals; patients die in ambulances because there is no emergency care, no oxygen, no nurses,” she said. “We are threatened by caretakers: ‘If something happens to my child, my husband is a Taliban, and he will come after you.’ How can we work safely like this?” Omar, a nurse from Gaza where more than 1,200 healthcare workers have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in the past two years, said staff at his hospital worked around the clock to “care for large numbers of patients with complex and traumatic injuries – including amputations, diabetic complications, and gunshot wounds – in an environment where both resources and personnel are increasingly scarce”. He said the scenes encountered during shifts inside the hospital, including “the lingering scent of blood” would “continue to haunt me in my dreams”, calling for “a simple thing: life, then life, then life in peace”. The 1949 Geneva conventions outlawed attacks on healthcare facilities and workers in war zones, with later resolutions further tightening international humanitarian law .

e5b8a8ee72d0,‘You are constantly told you are evil’: inside the lives of diagnosed narcissists,,"T here are times when Jay Spring believes he is “the greatest person on planet Earth”. The 22-year-old from Los Angeles is a diagnosed narcissist, and in his most grandiose moments, “it can get really delusional”, he says. “You are on cloud nine and you’re like, ‘Everyone’s going to know that I’m better than them … I’ll do great things for the world’.” For Spring, these periods of self-aggrandisement are generally followed by a “crash”, when he feels emotional and embarrassed by his behaviour, and is particularly vulnerable to criticism from others. He came to suspect that he may have narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) after researching his symptoms online – and was eventually diagnosed by a professional. But he doesn’t think he would have accepted the diagnosis had he not already come to the conclusion on his own. “If you try to tell somebody that they have this disorder, they’ll probably deny it,” he says – especially if they experience feelings of superiority, as he does. “They’re in a delusional world that they made for themselves. And that world is like, I’m the greatest and nobody can question me.” Though people have been labelled as narcissists for more than a century, it’s not always clear what is meant by the term. “Everyone calls everybody a narcissist,” says W Keith Campbell, psychology professor at the University of Georgia and a narcissism expert. The word is “used more than it should be” – but when it comes to a formal diagnosis, he believes many people hide it, as there is so much stigma around the disorder. A narcissist will tend to have “an inflated view of oneself”, “a lack of empathy”, and “a strategy of using people to bolster one’s self-esteem or social status through things like seeking admiration, displaying material goods, seeking power,” says Campbell. Those with NPD may be “extremely narcissistic”, to the point that “they’re not able to hold down stable relationships, it damages their jobs”, and they have a “distorted view of reality”, he says. Though up to 75% of people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are men, research from the University of London published last year suggests this figure does not mean there are fewer narcissistic women, but that female narcissism is more often presented in the covert form (also defined as vulnerable narcissism), which is less commonly diagnosed. “Men’s narcissism tends to be a bit more accepted, just kind of like everything in society,” says Atlanta-based Kaelah Oberdorf, 23, who posts about her NPD and borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnoses on TikTok . It is not uncommon to see the two disorders co-occur. I’ve never cared about anyone really, so I’ve never taken relationships seriously “I really struggle with handling criticism and rejection,” says Oberdorf , “because if I hear that the problem is me, I either go into defence mode or I completely shut down.” Despite having this response – which is sometimes referred to as “narcissistic injury”, she has been trying to overcome it and take advice from her loved ones, as she doesn’t want to slip into the harmful behaviour of her past. “I was very emotionally abusive to my partners as a teenager,” she says. Through dialectical behavioural therapy, she has been able to mitigate her NPD symptoms, and she says she and her current boyfriend “have a dynamic where I told him, ‘If I say something messed up, if I say something manipulative, call it out right then and there’.” Oberdorf grew up primarily in the care of her father and says she lacked positive role models as a child. “I’ve been learning all this time what is and is not appropriate to say during a fight because I never had that growing up,” she says. “Nothing was off-limits when my family members were insulting me when I was growing up.” Kaelah Oberdorf: ‘Nothing was off-limits when family members were insulting me when I was growing up.’ Personality disorders tend to be associated with difficulties as a child. “There is a genetic component,” says Tennyson Lee, an NHS consultant psychiatrist who works at the DeanCross personality disorder service in London. But, when someone develops narcissistic traits, it is often “linked to that individual’s particular early environment”. Those traits were “their strategy in some ways to survive at a very early age”, he adds, when they may have been neglected, or only shown love that was conditional on meeting certain expectations. They then “continue to use those same mechanisms as adults”. Like several of the NPD-diagnosed people I speak to, John (not his real name) thinks his parents “may be narcissists themselves”. The 38-year-old from Leeds says when he was a child, “everything was all about them and their work and their social life. So it was like, stay out of our way.” When their focus was on him, it came in the form of “a great amount of pressure” to achieve good grades and career success, he says, which made him feel that if he didn’t meet their standards, he wasn’t “good enough”. When he became an adult, none of his relationships ever worked out. “I’ve never cared about anyone really,” he says. “So I’ve never taken relationships seriously.” He didn’t think he was capable of loving someone, until he met his current partner of three years, who is diagnosed with BPD, so, like him, struggles with emotional regulation. She is “really understanding of the stuff that goes on in my head”, he says – it was actually she who first suspected he might have NPD. After a visit to his GP, John was referred to a clinical psychologist for an assessment and was told his diagnosis. He has been referred for talking therapy on the NHS (a long period of therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to help NPD patients, says Lee), but has been on the waiting list for a year and a half: “They said it is probably going to be maybe February or March next year.” John has only told a handful of people about his NPD diagnosis, because “there’s a big stigma that all narcissists are abusers”, but, privately, he has accepted it. “It helps me to understand myself better, which is always a good thing,” he says. All of the people I speak to have accepted their narcissism and are seeking help for it – hence being willing to talk about it – which is probably not representative of all people with the disorder. But the existence of NPD content creators such as Oberdorf and Lee Hammock , and the growth of online support communities, suggest that more narcissists are openly acknowledging the issues they face – and the ones they may be causing for others. “Seeing that you’re not alone in what you’re struggling with, being able to talk to other people who relate to you and maybe hearing coping mechanisms” are reasons why reddit user Phteven_j (who would like to remain anonymous) started joining in conversations about NPD online. Now a moderator of the r/NPD subreddit, the 37-year-old software engineer thinks he and his co-moderators are “pretty good about not encouraging disordered behaviour” and ensuring “it’s not a breeding ground for any sort of negative or disorder behaviour and more of a place where you can try to improve”. Illustration: Pete Reynolds/The Guardian Although, in volunteering as a moderator, “I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t seeking out some kind of position of authority” – which arguably stems from NPD symptoms – Phteven_j believes the subreddit is largely a force for good. However, the slew of reddit users wanting to complain about narcissists (and sometimes even the existence of a subreddit that acts as a support group for them) “is constant” he says. Across the internet, narcissists are often “painted as almost like supervillains” and the stories shared are often from the perspective of those who have been abused by someone they believe to be a narcissist. “The advice is, typically, the same: run away, you’ve got to leave them, don’t ever talk to them again,” the moderator says. Oberdorf is also critical of the way narcissism is discussed online. Social media users have accused her of “bragging” about her personality disorders because she lists them on her profiles and discusses them in her content. “I’m not bragging about the fact that I have debilitating mental illness,” she says. “I am proud of the fact that I have survived with mental illnesses that statistically could have taken my life.” She is keen to open up more conversations about NPD – “stigma is the number one worst thing for any illness ever”. Jay Spring: ‘A narcissist wanting to believe they are the best is coping with the feeling they are the worst.’ In this age of selfies and thirst traps, it can feel that narcissism must be on the rise. But just because there are now more outlets for narcissistic behaviour, prevalence of the clinical condition doesn’t seem to be increasing, says Lee. It’s worth noting, Campbell adds, that “social media is making people feel worse about themselves”, and, for most people, “it doesn’t make them feel positive about themselves or think they’re awesome”. The way NPD diagnoses are made is “suboptimal”, however, according to Lee. Most of the research on NPD has been done in the US, where a paper published by the American Psychiatric Association estimates the disorder is found in 1%–2% of the population. “If you make the diagnosis, then it’s made on the [American Psychiatric Association’s] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) guidelines, where it only captures an aspect of narcissism, which is the more overt, sort of aggressive type of narcissism, but it doesn’t capture the more covert or sensitive form,” says Lee. There are two most commonly talked about types of narcissism. The first is the “grandiose” or “overt” form, which manifests in stereotypically narcissistic behaviours such as aggression and attention-seeking. The second is a “vulnerable” or “covert” narcissist, which is “the kind of individual the clinician might miss, because they often come across as far more contained, even self-effacing at times”, Lee says. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism “are different sides of the same coin”, he says. Both types will have an inflated sense of their own importance, but for a covert narcissist that may mean a hypersensitivity to criticism or a victim mentality rather than a desire to put themselves in the spotlight. Campbell points out that there is a risk of narcissists “using social media to maintain their narcissism”, as it can be a tool “to get favourable attention or positive feedback”, but does see the benefit of positive role models and support for people with NPD. When a celebrity, such as the American comedian Nick Cannon in 2024 , “comes out with NPD and says it’s causing me problems, that’s a great message,” says Campbell, “that’s a great message”. Lee, too, is wary of social media being used to educate or as a support system for people with NPD, “because there’s so much misinformation”. But he believes “more structured” information is missing, particularly in the NHS. “The service for narcissistic individuals is very uneven throughout the UK” and “many clinicians don’t make the diagnosis of narcissism”, Lee says, partly because they aren’t primed to notice it, and partly out of reluctance to make a diagnosis that is perceived so negatively. The symptoms of NPD also mean that “if a narcissist is successfully leading their life, even though they might have quite a strong level of narcissism, they’re not going to seek treatment”. When a patient with NPD does seek help, it is often because they have suffered negative consequences of their narcissistic behaviour, or a partner or family member has encouraged them. Spring wishes people would reframe the way they think about narcissists. “A narcissist is attempting to believe that they are the best because that is the coping mechanism for feeling like: ‘I am the worst,’” he says. “There’s something missing with me and I need to be in this fantasy world where I’m the hero because maybe in my childhood I was the villain and now I need to overcompensate for that.” NPD is clearly a condition that requires psychological help, but Oberdorf can understand why narcissists don’t seek it: “If you have a problem, and you are constantly being told that people with your type of specific problem are unworthy, or they’re evil, or they’re horrible people because of this problem, why would you want to admit that you have that problem?”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/15/you-are-constantly-told-you-are-evil-inside-the-lives-of-diagnosed-narcissists,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbcc72991bf03b370b0ad20f2d1f833117ed6839/0_0_2996_2397/master/2996.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=997ea5da464681e80d3ba914a0ee3b4f",2025-10-15T04:00:13+00:00,09e1d596910f26808c94851948da88a681cf3e8f

1de137e8551e,"Ditch ‘shrink it and pink it’ women’s trainer design, say experts",,"Sports footwear manufacturers are being urged to ditch the “shrink it and pink it” approach when it comes to women’s running shoes. Over the past five decades, brands have invested billions of dollars into the development of trainers that prevent injury, maximise comfort and boost performance. But this research has overwhelmingly been designed for – and tested on – men, experts have said. Running shoes are typically designed using a three-dimensional foot-shaped mould called a last, which is usually based on male foot anatomy. Most sports footwear retailers use the same last for their entire range, and beyond making shoes smaller and changing the colour – a process known as ‘shrink it and pink it’ – only minimal modifications are made to create women’s shoes, the experts said. Brands are therefore failing to differentiate women’s distinct anatomical and biomechanical needs across the course of their lives, a small study published in the open access journal has concluded. Female- rather than male-based designs would probably boost women’s comfort, enhance injury prevention and improve their performance, the experts said. For the study, researchers led by Simon Fraser University in Canada interviewed women in Vancouver to find out whether they faced any issues with footwear for their runs. They recruited 21 study participants with the aim of including a broad range of ages, running experience and weekly running volume and frequency. Eleven were recreational runners who clocked up a weekly average of 19 miles (30km); 10 were competitive runners who averaged 28 miles. Nine of the women ran while pregnant or soon after giving birth. The women were aged between 20 and 70; their running experience ranged from six to 58 years. All of them were asked to rank in order of importance the factors informing their choice of running shoes. The responses showed that their primary considerations were the comfort and feel of the shoe, injury prevention and performance. In terms of comfort, most said they wanted a wider toe box, a narrower heel and more cushioning; competitive runners also wanted shoes incorporating performance-enhancing features, such as a carbon plate, as long as they did not compromise comfort. The women said they actively sought running shoes that they believed would help prevent running injuries. With this in mind, both groups emphasised the high value they placed on buying shoes from trusted sources. They also highlighted the need for different shoe designs or components to align with different running contexts – for racing, training, speed work or running with an injury, for example. And those who were mothers reported needing larger shoe sizes and a wider fit, as well as more support and cushioning during pregnancy and after giving birth. Competitive runners also said they needed added cushioning and support features in their footwear as they grew older. “Overall, our findings highlight a critical gap in the design of running footwear, which has been traditionally based on male anatomy and biomechanics,” the researchers wrote. “While participants did not always report an inability to find footwear, their narratives reflected a process of trial-and-error adaptation, often without guidance or purpose-built solutions. This suggests that their needs are not proactively addressed through current footwear design or communication.” They concluded: “We strongly recommend that the footwear industry should move beyond simply scaling down men’s shoes to fit women’s feet. Instead, there is a need for sex- and gender-specific designs that accommodate the distinct foot morphology of women and their social constructs and preferences, all of which evolve across the lifespan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/14/ditch-shrink-it-and-pink-it-womens-trainer-design-say-experts,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68cc561e883c43d6c1344fc83c08fdbf67d31e26/0_0_4667_3733/master/4667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae193a2364fe68ffc747e75d50a988a9",2025-10-14T22:30:06+00:00,923ddd0b350de51eeda7aa09aca71676aef45d04
1ac91da48641,Late-night pub openings aren’t in the right spirit,,"The government’s plan to extend licensing hours seems to be a rather desperate measure to encourage growth ( Pubs to stay open until early hours in push for UK growth, 8 October ). Will there be enough customers for pubs to afford the additional staffing and running costs of staying open later? Many pubs are already closing early on some evenings and perhaps not opening on others. If the government really wants to give licensed premises a boost, it should find a way of reducing the price of the drinks they sell, but this would be unpalatable when it’s looking for ways to raise taxes. Pubs and clubs should be an accessible resource for communities, where friends and families can come together. When pubs were thriving – many years ago – the price of a drink in a pub was much closer to that paid in a supermarket. Until that gap narrows, it is unlikely that there will be any hope of slowing down the alarming rate of pub closures. Clive Turner Barking Tye, Suffolk I wonder how encouraging alcohol consumption squares with the NHS’s plans to reduce the health harms of alcohol and the government’s commitment to prevent the incidence of mental health problems that result in people being unable to work. Alcohol misuse is clearly associated with a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, and is a significant cause of death. In 2023, we had the highest recorded number of alcohol-specific deaths in the UK (10,473). The cost to society of alcohol-related harm, including to the NHS, social care and the criminal justice system, is an estimated £27.4bn each year. It is hard to fathom why the government would contemplate these huge human and exchequer costs. But one should not underestimate the power of the purveyors of the commercial determinants of ill-health, including the drinks industry.

f9b8b649e398,What is the best pillow for your sleeping style?,,"Life is full of mysteries: What is dark matter ? What happened to DB Cooper ? And the most perplexing to me personally: how tall should pillows be? I can never seem to find the right pillow. They always seem too soft and flat, or too tall and stiff, and I end up tossing and turning all night. Currently, there are six pillows on my bed, none of which are quite right. Many people end up choosing the wrong pillow because they’re more focused on the qualities of the pillow than on how they sleep , says Dr Geet Paul, director of interventional pain medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine. “A pillow should keep the head and neck aligned with the spine,” says Paul. “But many pick one just because it feels soft or fluffy.” Finding the proper pillow is about more than just comfort. The wrong pillow can disrupt your sleep, and “ poor sleep quality is associated with poorer mental health, cardiovascular health, learning and memory function”, says Dr Doug Cary, musculoskeletal physiotherapy specialist and sleep educator. Here’s how to pick the right pillow for your needs. Finding the best type of pillow for you depends on how you sleep. There are four main sleep postures, says Cary: supine (on the back), prone (on the front), supportive side-lying (on the side with top knee behind bottom knee), and provocative side-lying (on the side with top knee forward of bottom knee). Supine and supportive side-lying are considered “supportive postures”, and prone and provocative side-lying are considered “provocative postures”, he says. “People who sleep in these provocative sleep postures were more likely to report a lower quality of sleep,” as well as waking spinal pain and stiffness, Cary says. What’s the best pillow set-up for each type of sleeper? When your head is resting on a pillow at night, your spine should be straight and well supported. “Poor positioning – such as twisting the neck or arching the lower back – can strain spinal structures and contribute to discomfort or long-term issues,” Paul says. Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ To select the best pillow, you need to know which position you favor. You may be mostly a side sleeper, for example. Note that “no one posture will be sustained during the night,” Cary says. “Even ‘normal’ sleepers will change their sleep posture 15-20 times on average.” That number could be twice as high for “poor” sleepers, he says. When it comes to materials, go with what feels best to you: memory foam, latex or regular foam. Fancy down pillows may be luxurious, but Cary says research has shown feather pillows to be the least comfortable. Other factors to consider are mattress firmness and body weight. With a softer mattress, your body will sink deeper. Therefore, you will need less pillow height, Cary says. The same goes for higher body weights. And to maximally support the spine, it may be helpful to have more than one pillow. Each sleep posture requires a different set-up, experts say. For back sleepers: In terms of alignment, the most important thing “is making sure the chin is not touching the neck, which can happen as a result of a tall/firm pillow”, says Dr Lindsay Orosz, director of research at the National Spine Health Foundation. Find a pillow soft enough to leave “at least four fingers between your chin and chest”, she says. Orosz also suggests back sleepers add support under the knees, like another pillow or a rolled-up blanket. This can reduce the anterior pelvic tilt – the arch under the back when a person lies down – and ease pressure on the lower back. skip past newsletter promotion Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts also suggest putting a pillow between your knees to keep the hips and back in line. A good rule of thumb is drawing an imaginary straight line “from the tip of the nose, to the sternum, to the belly button”, says Orosz. For front sleepers: “We would generally recommend trying not to sleep on your stomach,” says Paul. According to the Cleveland Clinic , sleeping on your stomach can lead to back, neck and shoulder pain because people tend to twist their necks and tuck their arms under pillows. If that is the position in which you most naturally sleep, Paul recommends placing thin pillows under the head and hips to help stabilize the spine. How often should you change your pillows? A pillow is not a lifetime investment . “Most pillows need to be replaced every 1-2 years,” says Orosz. If a pillow gets lumpy, you can’t get comfortable on it any more, or you start waking up with neck pain, it might be time to retire it, says Orosz. Test this by bending your pillow in half, she suggests. If it regains its shape when you let go, it’s fine to use. If not, consider a replacement. What other factors can cause discomfort? If you have persistent neck and back pain throughout the day, your problem might not be the pillow. A different sleep issue or a more serious underlying issue might be to blame. “If I am in a clinical consultation with a client who is expressing ongoing neck pain/stiffness and they have tried ‘every pillow under the sun’, this indicates that the pillow isn’t the source of their problems,” he says. He works with these clients on their sleep systems as a whole, including sleep posture. And, to reiterate, don’t sleep on your stomach if you can avoid it. “My strong clinical opinion is to avoid prone sleeping if you are serious about spinal health,” says Cary.",https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/oct/14/pillow-type-best-side-back-stomach-sleepers,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198979cd1c78af0efced279340dc7b5db22e8f13/0_0_1219_976/master/1219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27047bba052fa5390679f7aa33a4ea0d",2025-10-14T16:00:58+00:00,e15a174727ef0b3ddc8c0772d0467ef67307bea7
e6edeceef2d4,Dementia risk for people who quit smoking in middle age ‘same as someone who never smoked’,,"People who stop smoking in middle age can reduce their cognitive decline so dramatically that within 10 years their chances of developing dementia are the same as someone who has never smoked, research has found. Kicking the habit halves the rate of decline in verbal fluency and slows the loss of memory by 20%, according to a study of 9,436 people in England , the US and 10 other European countries. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that quitting smoking can slow the rate of mental deterioration that ageing brings and thus help prevent the onset of dementia. “Our study suggests that quitting smoking may help people to maintain better cognitive health over the long term even when we are in our 50s or older when we quit”, said Dr Mikaela Bloomberg of University College London, the lead researcher. “We already know that quitting smoking, even later in life, is often followed by improvements in physical health and wellbeing. It seems that for our cognitive health too it is never too late to quit, she added. Bloomberg and her colleagues from UCL reached their conclusions by comparing the cognitive functioning of adults aged at least 40 in the 12 countries who quit with those who kept smoking. While their performance was the same at the start, the quitters had gained substantial advantages over the smokers when their cognitive capacities were assessed over the next six years. “Individuals who quit smoking had more favourable [cognitive] trajectories following smoking cessation than continuing smokers”, they write in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. “The rate of cognitive decline was slower for smokers who quit than for continuing smokers in the period after smoking cessation. “The results suggest the importance of smoking cessation, even in later life, for long-term cognitive health.” Although the findings do not prove cause and effect, they could provide “compelling motivation” for older smokers – who are less likely than younger age groups to try to give up – to do so, the authors added. Smoking is one of the 14 risk factors for dementia which a commission of experts assembled by The Lancet medical journal identified last year. There is growing evidence that tackling them, which include depression, drinking too much, hearing loss and high cholesterol, reduce the risk of developing dementia in the first place, they added. “The findings strengthen existing evidence that changing to a healthier lifestyle can have a measurable impact on your brain health,” said Dr Richard Oakley, the associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer’s Society. “We know that quitting smoking, keeping physically active, eating a healthy balanced diet and drinking less alcohol can all help reduce the risk of dementia.” The paper explains that smoking is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration by both harming cardiovascular health, by affecting blood vessels that supply oxygen to the brain, and also by causing chronic inflammation and directly damaging brain cells through oxidative stress. However, Dr Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, cautioned that “the greater cognitive decline seen in smokers doesn’t mean that these people will go on to develop dementia”. Differences between the two groups in their socioeconomic background or alcohol intake may have influenced the results, she said. Caroline Cerny, the deputy chief executive at Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said: “We’ve known for some time that smoking increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline, but this important evidence shows that the harms can be slowed by quitting. “It illustrates just why it is so important to stop smoking at any age, but particularly in middle age before many of the symptoms of cognitive decline will have emerged and highlights the need for sustained investment in stop smoking services.” Last month, 35% of smokers in England tried to quit and 29% of them succeeded, almost double the rate seen when records began in 2007.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/14/dementia-risk-for-people-who-quit-smoking-in-middle-age-same-as-someone-who-never-smoked,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b6ac1e4751b5e9d4949368ff5f753b24ae71f0a/453_0_4310_3449/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=12cd9527a70a7cc5b28012f42528a827",2025-10-13T23:01:05+00:00,f387bc07fdf46aa3d3d2a4147f3eddf4d3412b71
67de50e1cf02,"Sharp global rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals, WHO finds",,"Hospitals across the world have recorded an alarming rise in common infections that are resistant to antibiotics, with doctors saying the number of deaths driven by drug resistance will increase sharply in the years ahead. One in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections were resistant to antibiotic treatments in 2023, with more than 40% of antibiotics losing potency against common blood, gut, urinary tract and sexually-transmitted infections between 2018 and 2023, records show. The problem was most severe, and worsening, in low and middle-income countries and those with weaker healthcare systems, according to the World Health Organization’s Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance report , which gathered data on more than 23m bacterial infections from 104 countries. “These findings are deeply concerning,” said Dr Yvan Hutin, the director of the WHO’s department of antimicrobial resistance. “As antibiotic resistance continues to rise, we are running out of treatment options and we are putting lives at risk, especially in countries where infection prevention and control is weak and access to diagnostics and effective medicine is already limited.” Estimates of resistance for some countries might be skewed by healthcare systems reporting data only from specialist hospitals that handle the most severe infections. But based on the records gathered, the WHO estimates one in three bacterial infections in south-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean were resistant to antibiotics in 2023, and one in five in Africa. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arises when pathogens evolve to withstand the drugs used to kill them. In 2021, 7.7 million people globally died from bacterial infections. Drug resistance contributed to 4.71 million of the deaths, with 1.14 million directly attributed. The report raises serious concerns about gram-negative bacteria – those protected by an outer shell – such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , which cause some of the most severe bacterial infections that often lead to sepsis, organ failure and death. Hutin said 40% of E coli and more than 55% of K pneumoniae are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first choice treatment for such infections. In the WHO African region, resistance often exceeds 70%, he said. Resistance to critical second-choice antibiotics, particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, was also rising among key gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter , K pneumoniae and salmonella, the report found. “These antibiotics are critical for treating severe infections and their growing ineffectiveness is narrowing the treatment options,” Hutin said. Dr Manica Balasegaram at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership said the report added to evidence that drug-resistant infections had reached “a critical tipping point”. “The most difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections are now beginning to outpace antibiotic development, either because the right antibiotics are not reaching the people who need them, or because they are not being developed in the first place,” he said. “As a result, the number of AMR deaths is now expected to rise sharply , increasing by 70% by 2050. “It’s not enough to develop new antibiotics, they have to be the right ones, those that target infections that have the greatest public health impact. We are failing to replace the antibiotics that are being lost to resistance, and this latest WHO report shows that the consequences of that are now finally beginning to be felt. skip past newsletter promotion Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To avoid the tipping point, we must now also focus efforts on accelerating innovation and increasing their appropriate use.” Prof Sanjib Bhakta, who works on drugs to tackle AMR at University College London and Birkbeck, University of London, said the WHO report revealed “an alarming escalation in resistance”, particularly among gram-negative bacteria. He said combating AMR required “tailored global action” from strengthening surveillance and diagnostics to ensuring equitable access to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Preventing infections was also important through cleaner water, better sanitation and hygiene and vaccination. “Crucially, renewed investment is needed to support interdisciplinary, blue-sky research aimed at discovering novel therapeutic interventions against drug-resistant bacteria,” he said.

d45083c005f8,Is it true that … cutting out carbs helps you lose weight?,,"T his is a bit of a grey area, says Bethan Crouse, a performance nutritionist at Loughborough University. She wouldn’t advise the athletes she works with to completely cut out carbohydrates – foods such as bread, grains, potatoes and sweets. “However,” she says, “reducing carbohydrate intake can be beneficial for weight loss, if we can moderate total energy intake.” Weight loss comes down to energy balance: consuming fewer calories than we burn. There are many ways to achieve this: exercising more, eating less, or choosing foods that are lower in calories. Cutting back on some carbohydrates can be one way to create this deficit, she says. Not because carbs are uniquely “fattening”, but because other macronutrients such as fibre, protein and fat tend to be more filling. “If we spend more of our calorie budget on these foods, we feel fuller for longer,” Crouse says. You’ll feel much better for eating a balanced, high-protein meal with vegetables and some healthy fats. It’s a better investment of your ‘calorie cash’ This is especially the case when it comes to refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and sweets, which are digested quickly. They can be useful as a pre-workout snack, but they’re less helpful as a staple carb source. Instead, Crouse recommends higher-fibre varieties at mealtimes, such as brown rice and wholemeal bread, which release energy more slowly. “You’ll feel much better for eating a balanced, high-protein meal with vegetables and some healthy fats,” she says. “It’s a much better investment of your ‘calorie cash’.” Crouse recommends consuming more carbohydrates on days when you’re working out: “It reduces the risk of illness and injury, and supports exercise adaptation.” On rest days or less active days, cutting back on carbs can help to reduce your overall energy intake, as long as you still include protein for muscle repair, plus plenty of fruit and vegetables for vitamins, fibre and antioxidants.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/13/is-it-true-that-cutting-out-carbs-helps-you-lose-weight,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a7a982b3b88f41bce40abe2c7b0f16dac8341c/0_0_1859_1487/master/1859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a337b321297f44e0bba0c645daec2567",2025-10-13T07:00:15+00:00,661556a5e8843f92be48a28a818dcd9f4c526355

But she defied the odds thanks to a heart and lung transplant, and at the age of 53 she has become the UK’s longest-surviving recipient of such a procedure. Mitchell was diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome when she was 11. She had high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries, which caused an increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs, which led to irreversible lung damage and heart failure. Mitchell had her combined transplant at Royal Papworth hospital in September 1987, a procedure so rare that only about five are carried out in the UK each year. “Thanks to organ donation, I was given the gift of a normal life,” she said. “I think about my donor a lot, especially on the anniversary of the transplant. I think about their family and what their family must have felt at the time. “I just know my donor was a young female. Her family made that decision at a terrible time in their lives. I am so grateful. “It’s quite difficult to put into words how it feels to know I am now the longest-lived heart-lung recipient in the UK. It’s mixed feelings.

Perhaps the immunosuppressants suit me well. Everybody has so many different reactions to the medications, and everyone has their own regimen.” There are currently 8,124 people on the UK transplant waiting list, including 12 waiting for a heart and lung transplant. Mitchell’s transplant is functioning well. She also had two kidney transplants from deceased donors in 1994 and 2015. Mitchell, from Sidcup in south-east London, said: “I went to an event at Papworth and there were a couple of young women who had their heart-lung transplants recently. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

cb36a79bde4e,The plastic inside us: how microplastics may be reshaping our bodies and minds,,"M icroplastics have been found almost everywhere: in blood, placentas, lungs – even the human brain . One study estimated our cerebral organs alone may contain 5g of the stuff, or roughly a teaspoon. If true, plastic isn’t just wrapped around our food or woven into our clothes: it is lodged deep inside us. Now, researchers suspect these particles may also be meddling with our gut microbes. When Dr Christian Pacher-Deutsch at the University of Graz in Austria exposed gut bacteria from five healthy volunteers to five common microplastics, the bacterial populations shifted – along with the chemicals they produced. Some of these changes mirrored patterns linked to depression and colorectal cancer. “While it’s too early to make definitive health claims, the microbiome plays a central role in many aspects of wellbeing, from digestion to mental health,” says Pacher-Deutsch, who presented his work at the recent United European Gastroenterology conference in Berlin. “Reducing microplastic exposure where possible is therefore a wise and important precaution.” Such discoveries raise unsettling questions: how much plastic do we each carry, does it really matter and can we do anything about it? Microplastics are shed from packaging, clothes , paints, cosmetics, car tyres and other items. Some are tiny enough to slip through the linings of our lungs and guts into our blood and internal organs – even into our cells. What happens next is still largely unknown. Microplastics come in different types and shapes, which may influence their harmful effect. Photograph: Maxshoto/Alamy “Designing a definitive experiment is hard, because we’re constantly being exposed to these particles,” says Dr Jaime Ross , a neuroscientist at the University of Rhode Island in the US. “But we know microplastics are in almost every tissue that has been looked at, and recent studies suggest we’re accumulating far more plastic now than 20 years ago.” Ross first grew curious about plastics as a teenager, watching her mother’s spaghetti-sauce containers corrode. “Many of us assumed plastic was inert – that it wouldn’t shed or react – but I realised it wasn’t,” she says. Fast-forward several decades and she began studying what microplastics might be doing to the mammalian brain. Her first study, published in 2023 , offered a hint: mice drinking water laced with microplastic particles started behaving differently. Usually, if you place mice in a brightly lit box, they hug the walls defensively. But those exposed to plastics restlessly ventured into the open – a behaviour more often seen with ageing and neurological disease. When the mice were dissected, plastic was found in every organ, including the brain, where a key protein linked to brain health, GFAP, was depleted – mirroring a pattern seen in depression and dementia. Since then, human studies have added to the unease. Microplastics have been detected in the brains of dementia patients , and in arterial plaques from people with heart disease. Those with plastic-laden plaques were almost five times more likely to suffer a stroke, heart attack or die within three years. Such findings gave me pause. Like Ross, I’d long assumed plastics were harmless, thinking little of chewing ballpoint pen ends, wearing synthetic clothes and reheating leftovers in takeaway containers. So when I heard about a £144 test from Plastictox promising to reveal how many microplastics were circulating in my blood, I pricked my finger and sent off a drop. We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmful Alan Morrison, the chief executive of Arrow Lab Solutions , the US company behind the test, said its goal was to provide people with an estimate of their microplastic exposure, allowing them to make lifestyle changes if they wished. “Sometimes this test is the kick in the butt that they need to get some of this [plastic] stuff out of their house and reduce their exposure,” he says. How plastics are accumulating inside our brains My test detected four microscopic particles – equivalent to about 40 per millilitre of blood. Based on their size, one probably got there through my gut while the other three were likely inhaled, the lab said. Although this places me in the lowest quarter of the 4,000-odd tests it has done so far, “it still represents about 200,000 plastic particles in your bloodstream”, Morrison says. “But considering the average person has over a million, you’re doing comparatively well.” Yet, as other experts point out, no one really knows what a “safe” level of microplastic looks like. The research field is extremely young and consumer tests are “very premature”, says Prof Stephanie Wright , a microplastics researcher at Imperial College London: “Your test results suggest you’ve got 40 particles per ml of blood – but we don’t know if that’s bad or good, what type of plastic, where they’ve come from, what they’re doing or where they’re going.” Scientific studies have used a variety of methods, making comparisons between them difficult. Some techniques – including the one used to quantify microplastics in human studies of dementia and heart disease – can suffer from interference from biological tissues. Because of this, their results are far from conclusive and should “be taken with a pinch of salt”, Wright says. Even if it is possible to accurately quantify the particles in blood or other tissues, it is uncertain whether all microplastics pose the same level of risk. “Plastics are quite heterogeneous. There are different types, but they also have different shapes, which may influence their harmful effects,” says Dr Vahitha Abdul Salam at Queen Mary University of London. The size of the particles also matters; the smaller they are, the more likely they are to cross biological barriers into organs or cells. The Plastictox blood test showed that Linda Geddes scored low for plastic particles – but there were still about 200,000 in her bloodstream. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian There are further challenges before we know for sure if microplastics are harming us: rodent studies may not translate to humans; because they’re so much smaller, the same-sized plastic particles may be taken up and processed very differently, says Salam. So where does that leave us? We’re continually exposed to these particles, and “historically, we know that exposure to too many particles is bad”, says Wright, pointing to air pollution as an example. “We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmful.” Another pressing question is whether some subjects might be more vulnerable than others. A recent follow-up study by Ross suggested that mice carrying the Alzheimer’s-associated APOE4 gene experienced more severe cognitive decline in response to microplastic exposure than those with less risky genes. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Detox Your Kitchen A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that although research suggests levels of microplastics in our bodies appear to have sharply risen in recent years , older people don’t seem to contain more than younger ones. “I found that positive, because it tells me we might be able to get them out of our bodies,” says Ross. Identifying ways to expedite this natural process – if it exists – is likely to be a significant research focus in the coming years. As for me, I can’t unsee those 200,000-odd particles. Whether or not that figure is accurate, it’s hard not to look around my plastic-coated life and wonder how I might start to unwrap it. Reheating leftovers in glass instead of plastic is a good place to start. And I’ll definitely stop chewing ballpoint pens. How to reduce your exposure Although it is impossible to avoid microplastics entirely, scientists say there are practical ways to reduce your personal exposure. Start in the kitchen. “The thing you definitely want to avoid is heat with plastic,” says Ross. “So not cooking your food with plastic utensils, not putting hot beverages or food into plastic.” Avoid microplastics getting into food by using a wooden rather than a plastic chopping board. Photograph: fotostorm/Getty Images/iStockphoto Salam says she has stopped microwaving food in plastic containers: “When you expose plastic polymers to heat or direct sunlight, this is what transforms or degrades them into microplastics.” Ross suggests examining everyday rituals such as making a cup of tea or chopping onions: “Teabags can release a lot of nano and microplastics. Even if the teabag is paper, they can be sealed with a plastic glue, so perhaps try loose-leaf tea. Are you cutting on a plastic board? Because this could also contaminate food.” Opt for glass or stainless-steel containers, utensils and coffee ware, and use wooden chopping boards instead. Although tap water contains some microplastics, UK tap water is treated to remove almost all of them and at least one study has suggested that some brands of bottled water contain far more.” However, other research has suggested that, in the UK at least, levels of microplastics in tap water and many brands of bottled water are similar. Beyond the kitchen, Ross recommends thinking about bedding and personal care products. “Try to have more natural fibres, especially for the things you’re sleeping in – bed sheets, blankets and pillows, because you can inhale nano and microplastics,” she says. Check the labels on personal care products and cosmetics: although plastic microbeads in, for example, face washes, are now banned, some cosmetics and items such as lotions, lipsticks and eyeshadows may still contain nano or microplastics under names such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane or acrylates. Also look out for hidden plastics in menstrual products, and opt for those made from 100% cotton or silicone cups. Airborne plastics are another concern. Although indoor environments generally have higher levels owing to synthetic textiles and furnishings, “tyre-wear from high-traffic environments is another source of microplastics exposure”, says Wright. “In the same way that you’d avoid air pollution by walking down quiet streets, trying not to walk next to traffic and having your windows closed in the car. This should theoretically minimise exposure to microplastics.” Finally, think about your environmental footprint. Plastics tossed into landfill will slowly degrade, shedding more microplastics. “If you have any plastic items in your house, like plastic containers, repurpose them to store sewing materials and other non-food items,” says Ross. “If you put them in the recycling, they may not get recycled and you’re just adding to the wider problem.” This article was amended on 14 October 2025 to clarify that, while some research has shown there are brands of bottled water that contain more microplastics than tap water, other analysis has found bottled water and tap water to have similar levels.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/12/plastic-inside-us-microplastics-reshaping-bodies-minds,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f771789968b21b0dfcfff8c14f7945ad9e1d1257/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15f88a9fdc285c08609c3a8ec0d4baee",2025-10-12T05:00:45+00:00,2a7e92c60c231fc34a33ac4a64d433fd61e8f16a
3002bff08c5d,"Diane Keaton, Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, dies aged 79",,"Diane Keaton, one of the best-loved film stars of the past 50 years, has died at the age of 79 in California. The news was confirmed by People magazine . Further details are not available at this time and her loved ones have asked for privacy, according to a family spokesperson. Keaton’s death came as a shock across Hollywood and the rest of the world. The actor had not been in the public eye for some months, but no illness had been announced. People quotes a source close to the actor saying that Keaton’s health had “declined very suddenly” over the past months, adding that even many of her longtime friends “weren’t fully aware of what was happening”. The Los Angeles fire department confirmed to TMZ that they had responded to an emergency call at Keaton’s home at 8:08am local time and an individual had been transported to a local hospital. Her frequent co-star Robert De Niro told the Hollywood Reporter: “I am very sad to hear of Diane’s passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.” In a statement shared with the Guardian, Meryl Streep, who starred alongside her in Marvin’s Room, called Keaton: “Our American treasure: indelible singular girl and brilliant artist. Crushing news that she is gone, but her smile and her style and antic spirit will live on film and in our hearts forever.” Keaton and DiCaprio in Marvin’s Room. Photograph: Tribeca Productions/Allstar Leonardo DiCaprio, who acted alongside both women in the film, called Keaton “brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself” on Instagram stories. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being.” Bette Midler, Keaton’s co-star in The First Wives Club, said on Instagram : “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!” The actor Michael Douglas, who starred alongside her in the 2014 romcom And So It Goes, called the loss “heartbreaking” and the actor “one of the greatest icons in our industry”, while Francis Ford Coppola said “everything about Diane Keaton was creativity personified”. Speaking on stage at a charity event, Reese Witherspoon recalled how Keaton, who she referred to as a “mentor”, had given her an early break on the 1991 TV movie Wildflower, concluding by urging audience members to “watch one of her movies and wear a really cool, interesting outfit, take a cool picture, and just live your dream. Be your unique, interesting self, I think Diane would be really happy.” Mary Steenburgen told Deadline that her co-star in the Book Club films was “magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend.” Keaton with her The First Wives Club co-stars Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in 1996. Photograph: Frank Wiese/AP Fellow Book Club star Jane Fonda, meanwhile, posted that she found it “hard to believe … or accept … that Diane has passed. She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative … in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her worldview. “Unique is what she was. And, though she didn’t know it or wouldn’t admit it, man she was a fine actress!” Alan Alda, Keaton’s co-star in the 1993 Woody Allen film Manhattan Murder Mystery, told the Guardian: He said “She’s leaving behind tender and unforgettable performances that will keep her in our hearts for a long time.” Keaton directed two music videos for the singer Belinda Carlisle, who wrote on X that she was “kind and eccentric and I was blessed to know her”. Also posting on X, the actor Ben Stiller called Keaton “One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.” Director Paul Feig posted that he was “so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend. She was an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend. She has been taken from us far too soon.” Keaton with Candice Bergen, Jane Fonda and Mary Steenburgen in Book Club (2018). Photograph: Photo credit: Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures/Allstar Nancy Sinatra said on X : “Diane Keaton has left us and I can’t tell you how profoundly sad that makes me. I adored her — idolised her. She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable.” Viola Davis, meanwhile, who did not share a screen credit with Keaton, although they were both originally slated to star in 2019’s Otherhood, posted to Instagram: “No!! No!!! No!! God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability — you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.” With Allen in Annie Hall. Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy An enduring and singular icon of cinema since her Oscar-winning turn in 1977’s Annie Hall – which her director, writer, co-star and former boyfriend Woody Allen based heavily on her own life – Keaton starred in some of the key movies of the last half century. Her keen self-deprecation, gift for comedy and distinctive dress sense – rarely seen without a hat, turtleneck or man’s tie and wide trousers – made her both highly distinctive and impossible to emulate. Her first major film role was opposite Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather – she reprised the role of Michael Corleone’s wife in the two sequels. Other Oscar nominations were earned for her performances in Reds (1981), Marvin’s Room (1996) and Something’s Gotta Give (2003). Meanwhile, dramas such as Looking for Mr Goodbar, Shoot the Moon and The Good Mother established her as an actor unafraid of playing difficult and unlikable women. Keaton in Love and Death. Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy Keaton and Allen first collaborated on the stage version of Play It Again, Sam, for which she was Tony nominated in 1971, before going on to work together for eight films, including Sleeper (1973), Love and Death (1975) and Manhattan (1979). In 1993, Keaton took on the role written for Mia Farrow in Manhattan Murder Mystery and remained a staunch supporter of Allen after the accusation by Farrow that he had abused their adopted daughter, Dylan. Allen has repeatedly denied the allegations, which were investigated and resulted in no criminal charges. Writing on Instagram in the wake of Keaton’s death, both of Allen’s adopted daughters with his wife, Soon-Yi Allen, posted their tributes to the actor, with Manzie saying she was “absolutely heartbroken”. Keaton went on to make a remarkable number of other popular and landmark comedies as well as those with Allen, including Baby Boom, Father of the Bride (and its sequels), The First Wives Club and Book Club. The sequel to that film, Book Club: The Next Chapter, released in 2023, looks set to be one of the last projects featuring Keaton. Speaking to the Guardian to promote it , she addressed why she chose to remain so prolific, making seven films since the start of the pandemic. “It gives me an opportunity to get to know more people in a different realm,” she said. “I love it. It’s all interesting. It’s never dull, ever, life.” She also explained her love for photographing doors and abandoned shops, which she said she found poignant “because life is haunting! You have an idea in your mind of what it is, or what it should be, or what it could be. But it’s not that at all! It’s just things going up and down!” Diane Keaton in a scene from The Godfather (1972). Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy In 1996, Keaton adopted a daughter, Dexter (named after Cary Grant’s character in The Philadelphia Story), and, four years later, a son, Duke. “Motherhood has completely changed me,” she said. “It’s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I’ve ever had.” Despite well-publicised relationships with some of her co-stars including Pacino and Warren Beatty , she remained unmarried. Keaton cared for her own mother from her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s in 1993 until her death in 2008, and devoted much of her own autobiographies to recounting her mother’s life and publishing her diaries. “She was everything to me,” she said of her mother. “She was wonderful. She was my example for what you can do with life. She was the heart of everything that was best.” Keaton was also the chief care-giver to her brother, Randy , who died in 2021, after years of mental-health problems. As well as acting primarily for the big screen, Keaton did some TV work, including as a scheming nun in Jude Law TV series The Young Pope. She also had a sideline flipping properties in the US, as well as lending her name and creativity to ranges of homeware, clothing, glasses and wine. In 2017, she was given a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute, in which she thanked her collaborators and sang Seems Like Old Times, the song her character sings in Annie Hall. In 2022, she paid tribute to her parents while putting her hands into cement to be immortalised on the Hollywood walk of Fame, saying she was “still that little Dianey” who dreamed of being a movie star. “As a girl growing up in Orange County, the mere thought of Hollywood Boulevard seemed like a mysterious dream that would never come true,” she said. In December 2024, in what seems likely to be her final performance shared with the public, Keaton released her first single, a festive song called First Christmas , posting the video to Instagram. An enthusiastic adopter of social media, her last post was in April to mark National Pet Day, and featured a photograph of the actor with her beloved golden retriever, Reggie. She is survived by her two younger sisters, Dorrie and Robin, as well as by Dexter, 29, and Duke, 25.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/11/diane-keaton-oscar-winning-star-of-annie-hall-and-the-godfather-dies-aged-79,Health,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c8f22bf3ba1b1c9deb6a76c7dc4d07af912980/488_254_2594_2075/master/2594.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2296b52378e14385134e215a717d6562",2025-10-11T19:15:39+00:00,8bbdf2ba8253086897815c49a282a47ce3dbcb66
be9e4c47e93e,Will UK taxpayers get their £122m back from PPE Medpro?,,"The five-year unravelling of Britain’s most high-profile Covid contracts scandal involving a baroness, her husband and multimillion-pound government deals accelerated last week with a high court judgment against the company linked to the former Tory peer Michelle Mone . The judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, ruled that PPE Medpro, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, supplied defective personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the NHS during the pandemic. Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department of Health and Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’s stated determination to recover some of the billions of pounds in public money wasted during the Covid crisis by Boris Johnson’s administration. “We want our money back. We are getting our money back,” Reeves posted on X . “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.” The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles and Mone admitted they had lied . Michelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment. Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/Getty The gowns were rejected on inspection in September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October. Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment, PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvency and administrators appointed. So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone has accused Reeves of inflammatory language after the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couple said in a BBC interview in December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust. In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium. Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used. However, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the years owned luxury yachts, a private jet and prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment. The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this week if Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.” The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’” Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman. Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA Media The spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.” In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.” PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration. The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult. There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders. “There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner at SA Law , said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.” It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences, including fraud by false representation , in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing. The NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officers raided the couple’s mansion on the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowman agreed to a freezing order of more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, complained during the high court trial that the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”. In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.” Illustration: Guardian Design Reeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of the Covid counter-fraud commissioner among other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday. The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.” Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition which was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.” This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.

We've bowled well in the last couple of matches so hopefully we can improve our bowling in the next few games.

[What didn’t you do well enough with the bat?] Probably adapting as quickly as possible to how much the wicket was seaming. We couldn’t put a partnership together at all. [On the form of the other batters] Everyone’s practising really well and I guess it’s about finding a way to do that in games. We’re going to do a different ground now, in Indore, so we’ll have to assess the conditions there and pick out different tools that we all have.

Omaima snicks a big drive for four, past the fielder at short third, before slicing a deliberate boundary off the last ball. England are in several sorts here, maybe all sorts. Omaima Sohail hits a boundary as Pakistan motor along towards their total. Photograph: Sameera Peiris/Getty Images Share Updated at 12.03 EDT 4th over: Pakistan 24-0 (Muneeba 8, Omaima 10) No problems for Omaima in Smith’s second over: she drives two boundaries through the covers to continue Pakistan’s fine start. Smith didn’t get her length right – the first was a full toss, the second overpitched – but Omaima put both deliveries away with auhority. 3rd over: Pakistan 14-0 (Muneeba 7, Omaima 1) This would be a landmark victory for Pakistan. They’ve lost all 13 completed ODIs against England, and the head-to-head across both white-ball formats is P31 W1 L30. Sciver-Brunt shakes her head in frustration after slipping a loose delivery down the leg side for five wides. Jones could only help the ball on its way. England aren’t really threatening go take the early wickets they need to undermine Pakistan’s runchase. 2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Muneeba 6, Omaima 0) What England would give for Linsey Smith to run through the top order as she did against South Africa. There are no wickets in her first over - but she does cause plenty of problems for the right-handed Omaima, who almost falls over an inswinger and then survives an LBW appeal after playing around her front pad. Missing leg. 1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Muneeba 5, Omaima 0) Sciver-Brunt’s third ball is too short and cut for four by Muneeba Ali. The rest of the over is spot on, just a single from it. It’s a quick turnaround – no time to waste – and the players are back on the field. With Lauren Bell not playing today, Nat Sciver-Brunt will open the bowling. Share Updated at 11.39 EDT Pakistan's target is 113 from 31 overs They are favourites. They are Pakistan. 31st over: England 133-9 (Glenn 3, Smith 4) Smith and Glenn manages to scamper five from the last two deliveries; who knows, they could be vital. England scored 54 for 2 in that six-over mini-session, an excellent effort from the lower order that has at least given them something to protect. We don’t know Pakistan’s target yet but the commentators think it will be around 113. And finally, Fatima’s figures of 4 for 27 are the best for Pakistan against England in a momen’s ODI. Share Updated at 11.29 EDT WICKET! England 126-9 (Dean c Omaima b Sana 33) Fatima Sana strikes again! Even in the final over that’s an important wicket, her fourth of the innings. Dean tried to ramp Fatima for four but didn’t clear Omaima at short fine leg. Charlie Dean is out for a handy 33. Photograph: Sameera Peiris/Getty Images Five balls remaining. Dean did well to score 28 from 19 balls after the restart. Share Updated at 11.29 EDT 30th over: England 125-8 (Dean 33, Glenn 0) That was the last ball of an eventful penultimate over: 13 runs, a dropped catch, a missed run-out chance and finally the run out of Arlott. Share Updated at 11.22 EDT WICKET! England 125-8 (Arlott run out 18) Arlott smashes the ball back at Omaima, who can’t hold on to a very tough return catch above her head. The wet conditions aren’t great for the spinners, and Omaima bowls successive full tosses that are walloped for four and then two by Dean. Arlott would have been run out off the second delivery had Omaima’s flick throw hit the stumps. Dean cuts four more, a superb stroke, and then Arlott is run out at the non-striker’s end after trying to steal a single to backward point. Em Arlott is run out for 18. Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/AP Share Updated at 11.26 EDT 29th over: England 112-7 (Dean 23, Arlott 15) Pakistan have a big LBW appeal turned down when Dean under-edges a reverse sweep onto the pad. The resulting run is given as a leg-bye but she definitely hit it; had she not done so it would have been a really good shout too. Arlott gets her second boundary by helping a leg-stump full toss from Shamim round the corner. Useful runs, these: Dean and Arlott have added 33 in four overs since the restart. 28th over: England 102-7 (Dean 20, Arlott 9) Dean, who is charging almost every delivery she faces, smashes the ball just past the outstretched left hand of the bowler Omaima. That shot brings one of four singles from the first five balls – but then Arlott clips a superbly placed shot through midwicket for four to make it eight from the over. 27th over: England 94-7 (Dean 18, Arlott 3) Rameen Shahim, who had figures of 4-1-3-1 before the rain delay, concedes 10 from her fifth over. Dean, such a smart and resourceful lower-order batter, nails a reverse sweep through point for four and then scampers back for consecutive twos. Four overs to go. Share Updated at 11.13 EDT 26th over: England 84-7 (Dean 9, Arlott 2) Omaima Sohail, the occasional offspinner, comes on for the first time in the innings. England try to force the pace without a huge amount of success – there are five runs from the over including two iffy singles to mid-off. Arlott would have been out with a direct hit; Dean was fractionally home when the throw hit the stumps. DLS will still be needed to determine Pakistan’s target. The chances are England’s eventual total will be reduced. Okay, here we go. Charlie Dean and Em Arlott will resume on 5 and 1 respectively , with Sarah Glenn and Linsey Smith – both authentic tailenders – to come. Sounds a bit daft but, even with only six overs left, Dean and Arlott should probably take a couple of overs to get themselves in. Yep, play will restart at 4pm BST. It’s actually 31 overs a side, not 30. The two captains are chatting to the umpires , who seem unsure about something. There are a few damp patches on the outfield; the umpire were also patting the pitch inquisitively a few minutes ago. Share Updated at 10.39 EDT The umpires are inspecting again , which suggests the restart time could be brought forward. Oh cricket, how you spoil us. Match reduced to 30 overs a side Apparently the match is now 30 overs a side. England will resume on 79 for 7 from 25 overs, and in abundant bother. Share Updated at 10.42 EDT Anyone out there? A reminder that, if the match is reduced to a 20-over, Pakistan’s target will be 61. And Sophie Ecclestone isn’t playing. Play will resume at 4pm BST (8.30pm local time) No word yet on how many overs have been lost or whether England will bat again. The covers are coming off In an unlikely development, the rain has eased and the groundstaff are getting into their work. We’re still a fair way from a resumption – potentially hours rather than minutes – but it’s a promising development. Share Updated at 10.02 EDT Our weekly cricket newsletter, which started in 2002, is still going strong. In today’s edition, Jim Wallace remembers some of the supporting actors who have stolen the show in men’s Ashes series. Thanks Tanya, hello folks. It’s bleak, bleak, bleak in Colombo, with time running out to begin a clean-up operation that would enable the match to resume by 9.38pm local time (5.08pm BST). If England do escape with a point, they’ll probably need to win only one of the last three games to reach the semi-finals. That sounds straightforward until you remember those games are against India, Australia and New Zealand. I’m getting ahead of myself. Won’t you look at that weather in Colombo! Time for me to go. Rob Smyth will entertain you as the rain falls, and hopefully bring you some sort of a match before the clock runs down. Bye! The rain continues to fall And while it does – shall we stroke our chins over England’s batting? Do they need to switch things up before the games against Australia and India? Bring in Danni Wyatt-Hodges? Move Emma Lamb, PCA player of the year with a thousand runs opening the batting in domestic cricket, up the order? No news. On the No Balls podcast , a fascinating interview with Sophie Devine, talking about the fact this her last World Cup. “There’s a sense of freedom. I can drop all the other stuff, and go out and play cricket. We’ve spoken a lot about how much energy I’ve got but now I’ve got nothing afterwards so if I’m absolutely carked at the end of it, its like – who cares. “I want to be carried off the field in that last game because I’ve given every part of my mind, body and soul to the game and there’s a real sense of freedom in that.” Time for another coffee. We are now losing overs from this game Beat the clock. Working backwards, if the teams do get out there at 5.08, Pakistan would need 61 from 20 overs. We’re back in Colombo, where Nasser Hussain reports on heavy rain getting heavier. Young fans chat on yellow plastic seats, families sit inside, including Katherine S-B and baby Theo. Sky’s commentators mull over the tea leaves.“Pakistan were exceptional, they hit a really good length, Fatima was exceptional. We saw the most seam movement we’ve see in this tournament. England’s frailties against the ball were exposed. Pakistan made good adjustments in terms of their seam position. England didn’t have an answer, they didn’t come forward int he crease.” Over on the BBC, Alex Hartley is asked what her favourite surprise of the tournament has been, “Bangladesh - they’ve competed way more than the West Indies would have done, and I’m looking forward to seeing how they improve between this and the next World Cup.” And as player (so far) of the tournament: Sophie Ecclestone and Sophie Devine for Hartley, Nadine de Klerk for Dan Norcross, and Richa Ghosh and Ecclestone for Estelle Vasudevan . Do any OBO readers have any alternative suggestions? The cut off time for this match is 5.08pm. Sky have now resorted to a library match of England v Pakistan men back in the days when Ryan Sidebottom played. So I don’t think we’re going to be seeing any action from Colombo for a while. Pakistan got so close to bowling Australia out, if they could finishes things off against England it would be a huge boost to their confidence. Though their brittle batting would then have to shimmy the runs from somewhere. No news from Colombo, but I assume it’s still raining. Ah, here we are, the television pictures show a ground masquerading as a swimming pool, completely covered by blue covers. Ah. Photograph: Lahiru Harshana/Reuters Share Updated at 07.53 EDT This was Raf’s take from last week. Some prescient observations. Hello there Geoff Wignall. “Not there yet, but has a team ever been bowled out in an ODI without a single catch or runout?” Hmmmm… let me come back to you that one. Pakistan are applauded off the field by their coaching staff, England must face a stern-faced Edwards. A really special performance by Pakistan’s bowlers. I think we’re in for a bit of a delay here, so will go and grab a coffee – back shortly. The rain saves England…for now.

dddcd6c01936,On the plane or the sofa? How England’s 2026 World Cup squad is shaping up,,"On the plane Fresh from breaking Gordon Banks’s record for consecutive England clean sheets, Jordan Pickford remains the undisputed pick in goal. A miserly defensive record is a positive for Thomas Tuchel, even if the shutouts have come against poor sides. John Stones , such an elegant centre-back, is back in the team and will start at the World Cup if he stays fit. But who will partner him? Tuchel likes Ezri Konsa , whose versatility also makes him an option at right-back, and Marc Guéhi ; big Dan Burn also looks established after making his international debut in March. It is more uncertain at left-back, but Reece James will play at right-back as long as his body does not let him down. If Reece James (left) can stay fit, he can be the starting right-back next summer. Photograph: John Walton/PA Declan Rice is a guaranteed starter in midfield and Elliot Anderson has been a revelation since his debut last month. Jordan Henderson ’s selection no longer feels controversial, especially as he is back in the Premier League and playing well for Brentford. Some picks are obvious. Bukayo Saka remains the man on the right wing and Noni Madueke excelled in the win against Serbia last month. Morgan Rogers , an emerging Tuchel favourite, continues to counter-press and link well at No 10. Eberechi Eze , who can play in a range of positions across the frontline, is also well placed and there was praise for Anthony Gordon ’s lively performance on the left against Latvia on Tuesday night. As for Harry Kane , what more needs to be said? In the departure lounge The big question is whether Jude Bellingham will force his way back into Tuchel’s plans. Will he respect the hierarchy and follow tactical instructions? Much will become clearer when the head coach names his squad for the games against Albania and Serbia next month. Another snub for Bellingham would speak volumes. But can England afford to go to the World Cup without one of their most talented players? The likeliest outcome is surely a humbler version of Bellingham returning to the fold. Tuchel, though, has been strong on building a collective; he does not care about celebrity. The team come first and that may mean some big names missing out. Cole Palmer is at risk. He has played only once for Tuchel and is struggling with a groin injury. But in a squad of 26 would it be wise to overlook a player with such a good record in big games? Cole Palmer remains one of England’s most talented players, but could he miss out? Photograph: Andre Weening/Shutterstock Dean Henderson will push Pickford, while the only worry for the Manchester City goalkeeper James Trafford is a lack of football after the arrival of Gigi Donnarumma at the club. Ollie Watkins is first in line behind Kane. Marcus Rashford has dropped to the bench and has been challenged by Tuchel to show more consistency but will be impossible to leave out if he impresses for Barcelona. Kane needs runners around him. An in-form Rashford is a potent weapon on the left and provides cover in the middle. As for the full-backs, the speedy duo of Tino Livramento and Djed Spence can play on both flanks and have done well in recent outings. Myles Lewis-Skelly is more vulnerable – Tuchel has said he needs to start more for Arsenal – but it is worth remembering that he is left-footed. One of Gareth Southgate’s biggest errors at Euro 2024 was not picking a specialist left-back. Hoping for a ticket There will be a clamour for Tuchel to pick Adam Wharton . The Crystal Palace midfielder had to withdraw from the September camp and saw his place go to Ruben Loftus-Cheek . There was then no room for Wharton this month. But if a player with his passing range continues to thrive for Palace it would surely be a mistake for Tuchel to leave him out. Competition is fierce. Phil Foden is an extravagant talent but was a high‑profile omission this time and could be squeezed out because of the number of creators available to Tuchel. Jack Grealish is in a similar spot. Jarrod Bowen has been in the past two squads but is in a struggling West Ham team and may be reliant on an injury to Madueke. Morgan Gibbs-White is in Tuchel’s thoughts but has to lift his form at Nottingham Forest. Can the highly rated Liam Delap force his way into the squad as back-up for Harry Kane? Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images One thing in Bowen’s favour is his ability to play up front. Tuchel namechecked him as a potential striker option if Kane is injured. He also mentioned Chelsea’s Liam Delap , who is out with a long‑term hamstring injury. Another Chelsea player who could make a late bolt is Levi Colwill . The defender is out with a serious knee injury but was excellent at the Club World Cup. The Bayer Leverkusen defender Jarell Quansah also has a chance. Manchester City’s Nico O’Reilly and Rico Lewis could challenge Lewis-Skelly. On the sofa Kyle Walker ’s time is up and Tuchel seems unmoved by Trent Alexander-Arnold , partly because of his doubts over the Real Madrid right-back’s defensive nous. Trevoh Chalobah did not do enough with his opportunity against Senegal in June, Harry Maguire is too up and down at Manchester United and Eric Dier ’s hopes look remote. Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite is injured. The Newcastle goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale and Nick Pope probably have to brace themselves for disappointment. Conor Gallagher and Curtis Jones have fallen from favour in midfield. Tuchel loved Mason Mount at Chelsea but the United midfielder has not played for England since the 2022 World Cup. Kobbie Mainoo , who started in the European Championship final, and Angel Gomes have not caught Tuchel’s eye. Harvey Elliott , who starred for the Under-21s last summer, has too many players in front of him and it is probably a tournament too soon for Jobe Bellingham and Ethan Nwaneri . It is telling that Tuchel did not mention Ivan Toney or Dominic Solanke when he named potential stand-ins for Kane. Kobbie Mainoo started the Euro 2024 final but has not caught Thomas Tuchel’s eye.

f13fe415276d,India to host 2030 Commonwealth Games – next stop the 2036 Olympics?,,"India will be formally approved as hosts of the centenary Commonwealth Games in 2030 next month as the country steps up its ambitions to stage the 2036 Olympics. Commonwealth Sport says its executive board had recommended Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat, as the host city for the 2030 Games ahead of what it called an “ambitious bid” by Nigeria. The decision still needs to be ratified by a general assembly in Glasgow on 26 November, but multiple sources described that process a formality. The Commonwealth Sport chief executive, Katie Sadleir, said: “Today’s recommendation is strategically important for the future of the Commonwealth Sport movement. It builds on the platform that Glasgow 2026 will provide and sets a clear direction for the years ahead. “The Centenary Games in 2030 offer an opportunity not just to celebrate 100 years of history, but to demonstrate how the Commonwealth Games can continue to evolve, creating meaningful impact for athletes, communities and nations across the Commonwealth.” The announcement has far wider implications as Ahmedabad is also where India intends to stage the 2036 Olympics. But its bid for the biggest event in global sport has faced a number of bumps in recent months that have put other contenders – including Qatar, Istanbul and Hungary – on high alert. Germany and Saudi Arabia are also keen on staging a future Games, although their focus is more on 2040. A British bid for either 2036 or 2040 is highly unlikely, with UK Sport more interested in the possibility of hosting in 2044. The lack of a heavyweight rival for 2036 has led many insiders to anoint Ahmedabad favourites, especially as Nita Ambani, whose family is the richest in India, is a prominent IOC member. However, one source said that the Indian bid was given a “wake-up call” by the International Olympic Committee when it visited Lausanne in the summer, with concerns raised about mismanagement and governance issues at the Indian Olympic Association, the lack of detail in the bid and the country’s dismal performance at the Games. Last year in Paris, India’s athletes finished 71st in the medal table with six medals. India’s doping problems are also a concern to the IOC as it continues to be high on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s watch list, with 260 positive cases of national and international athletes last year. Another setback came when the new IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, paused the host city bidding process in July in response to members’ request to have more involvement in the process. It had been thought that Ahmedabad would benefit from the same secretive selection policy that led to Brisbane being handed the 2032 Games without a thorough bidding process. However, Coventry has indicated that members will now have a far greater say. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sport in Focus Sign up to Sport in Focus Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Planning and then staging a successful multi-event global sports competition, such as the 2030 Commonwealth Games, would certainly help assuage some of those issues and doubts. The announcement was greeted with joy by Dr P T Usha, who said it would help the country’s stated goal of being fully developed by the centenary of its independence in 2047. “It would be an extraordinary honour for India to host the Centenary Commonwealth Games,” he said. “The Games would not only showcase India’s world-class sporting and event capabilities, but also play a meaningful role in our national journey towards Viksit Bharat 2047 .” India’s involvement is also a welcome boost to the Commonwealth Games itself, given it faced an existential crisis barely two years ago when Victoria and then the Gold Coast pulled out of staging the 2026 Games due to financial issues.

81febbcd360b,George Russell stays at Mercedes next season but door not shut on pursuit of Verstappen,,"George Russell will remain with Mercedes for next season after the Formula One team confirmed they would be sticking with their drivers in 2026. However, the length of the contracts signed by the Briton and his teammate, Kimi Antonelli, have not been specified, potentially leaving the Formula One team open to once more pursue Red Bull’s Max Verstappen for 2027. The long-expected decision comes after a protracted period of negotiation with Russell, as Mercedes seek stability going into the new regulations of 2026. The 27-year-old British driver has five wins in eight seasons in F1, including victory in Singapore, helping propel Mercedes into a fight for second in the world championship with Ferrari and Red Bull. Russell, who came up through the Mercedes junior programme, is fourth in the world championship. “I am really proud to be continuing our journey together,” he said. “Next year will mark my 10th since I signed with Mercedes back in 2017. It has been such a long and successful partnership so far and I can’t wait to see what lies ahead, particularly as we embark on one of the largest regulation changes in the sport’s history next year.” It is understood his desire to reduce his marketing and PR commitments was part of the deal but the length of the contract is likely to have played a significant part. This year the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, made no secret of his desire to lure the four-time world champion Verstappen away from Red Bull. However, before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen confirmed he would remain with Red Bull for 2026 , so Mercedes were expected to stick with their drivers for the new season. The team’s announcement, made before this weekend’s United States Grand Prix, makes no mention of the duration of the new deals. A two-year arrangement is standard but both drivers could be on a 1+1 deal which enables either party to exercise an opt-out after the first year. Kimi Antonelli has also signed a new deal with Mercedes. Photograph: Jayce Illman/Getty Images With a complete reset of the regulations next season the form book could change radically and Mercedes will be looking to be flexible come mid-season when it becomes clear who has come out on top, leaving the door open for another pursuit of Verstappen. A switch would look more attractive to the Dutch world champion should, as many expect, Mercedes emerge with a strong car. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The 19-year-old Antonelli, who was brought in from the team’s junior programme to replace Lewis Hamilton this season, has had a rollercoaster first year in F1 but became the third youngest driver to take a podium with third place in Canada.

194aed3aa9ad,"Ryder Cup triumph being remembered for the wrong reasons, says Rory McIlroy",,"Rory McIlroy is eager to shift discussion of last month’s Ryder Cup from the dominant theme of unruly spectators to the “incredible” strength of Europe’s display. Luke Donald and his European team secured back-to-back Ryder Cup wins after reaching what ultimately proved an unassailable position within two of the event’s three days. The reference point for Bethpage Black, though, has been appalling fan conduct; including significantly towards McIlroy. The Masters champion’s wife was hit by a beer thrown from the galleries at one point, with McIlroy himself subjected to abuse throughout. McIlroy’s return to the competitive fold, this week at the India Championship, has led him to try to change the topic of conversation. “I’ve been following the narrative coming out of the Ryder Cup just like everyone else,” said the Northern Irishman. “Unfortunately, I think it takes away from what we focused on, which was what an incredible performance it was by the European team. “As I’m playing my matches, I’m focused on trying to win my point. You see that the other guys are winning their matches or they are doing well but you don’t realise how well they are playing. “So just over the last two weeks, being able to watch the highlights and just see, especially those first two days, in the foursomes and the fourballs how good the European team were. The Americans would hit it close, we hit it closer. The Americans hole a putt and we hole a putt on top. It happened every single time. Team Europe’s Rory McIlroy celebrates with the trophy during the presentation after winning the Ryder Cup. Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters “The unfortunate thing is people aren’t remembering that and they are remembering the week for the wrong reason. I would like to shift the narrative and focus on how good the European team were and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.” In the immediate aftermath of Europe’s win, McIlroy insisted golf should be proud to seek high standards from competitors and spectators. Some believe this presents the sport with a dilemma as it looks to engage youngsters. “You don’t want your sport to be unwelcoming to newcomers,” McIlroy added. “I absolutely get that. But you also don’t want newcomers coming into the game and ruining centuries of traditions and values of what this game represents or what it upholds. I think there has to be a balance. “I certainly think that golf can grow but it can grow in a way where the people that are coming into the game still respect and acknowledge that this is a little bit different than maybe other sports. I say it in America all the time, golf doesn’t need to be the NFL. It doesn’t need to be these other sports. Golf is golf, and that’s fine. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion “I’d love more people to watch golf. That would be amazing. But I would be more interested in getting more people to play the game, and I think when people play the game, then they learn and they can acknowledge what golf is, what it represents, and the sort of etiquette and the values that you need to adhere to when you play the game.” McIlroy has European teammates Shane Lowry, Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland for company on his maiden visit to India. Donald is also in the field, with the Englishman yet to decide whether he wants to captain Europe for what would be a third time, at Adare Manor in 2027. “I think what Luke Donald has done the last two Ryder Cups has revolutionised the captaincy within Europe,” said McIlroy. “The effort and the dedication that Luke Donald has put into the last four years, it’s been absolutely amazing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/ryder-cup-golf-europe-triumph-unruly-fans-rory-mcilroy,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43457d6c6365bc82f70daf0226efc1819e296b1c/161_283_5560_4447/master/5560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd6b517bd67512ab2d2b9606bfc0e989",2025-10-15T13:24:41+00:00,df4638a703fb445193875e8dc229572a9a6ecce9
03426730a8ba,British basketball chaos continues as Fiba suspends BBF and bans men’s team,,"The British Basketball Federation has been suspended by the global body Fiba and the British men’s team banned from international competition in a dramatic move that has put the sport’s funding under threat. The Guardian has learned that Fiba has had talks with UK ­government officials about the suspension, which is likely to have implications on the government’s financial support for British ­basketball to the tune of £4.75m over the next four years. Fiba’s bold step is the latest develop­ ­ ment in the civil war that has engulfed British basketball this year. ­Stephanie ­Peacock, the sports minister, had discussions with UK Sport in April outlining concerns about British basketball’s governance. All organisations seeking govern­ment or national lottery funding must comply with UK Sport and Sport England’s code for sports governance. It sets out minimum standards regarding transparency, accounta­bility and integrity. UK Sport is responsible for funding elite sport, with Sport England in charge of grants to the grassroots. Fiba’s decision follows its creation of a taskforce in August to investigate a series of governance issues related to the BBF awarding a 15-year licence to run a new professional men’s competition, the Great Britain Basketball League, to a consortium led by the American businessman Marshall Glickman. The existing nine Super League Basketball clubs are refusing to join the new league, claiming the tender process was unlawful , and have launched legal action against the BBF in the high court. Fiba’s suspension is the first of a national governing body since ­Russia and Belarus were kicked out three years ago in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Fiba said: “Fol­lowing a comprehensive review of the situation, including interviews and meetings with basketball stakeholders, the taskforce has submitted its recommendations to the Fiba executive committee, which decided today as follows: “To temporarily suspend the British Basketball Federation’s authority to licence or recognise national men’s competitions and to field a men’s national team in Fiba senior competitions, pending resolution of the current governance issues. “To authorise the taskforce to engage directly with basketball stakeholders and the UK government to explore and propose an interim operational framework for the top-tier men’s national competitions. These measures aim to restore regulatory integrity and promote sustainable governance of men’s basketball in Great Britain as soon as possible.” Fiba’s move casts further doubt over the GBB League, which had already announced a delay to its initial launch date by 12 months until September 2027 to align with the possible launch of NBA Europe. The new venture does not have any clubs, venues or commercial partners. The immediate future for the Great Britain men’s team is also uncertain, with a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania due to take place next month now in doubt. In another recent development, Chris Grant resigned on Sunday as the BBF chair, citing personal reasons.

3b82c8897548,Beware the quiet man: Ashes folklore is littered with unlikely names stepping up,,"H ave you heard about Big Pat’s back? You must have by now. The eyes and ears of the cricketing world are zeroed in on a locus of around 10 inches of Pat Cummins’ lumbar region. Hushed whispers about the Australia Test captain’s “stress injury” after his side’s tour of West Indies in July became a rumbling concern as the weeks passed and there was no reassuring statement from the Cummins camp. Ideally it would have been delivered by the man himself with a megawatt smile, just letting everyone know that he was locked in for full part in the Ashes series. By contrast, earlier this week a more circumspect Cummins put his chances of playing at Perth in the first Test on 21 November as “probably less likely than likely”. Things may well change in the next six weeks but if they don’t then it is a tremendous shame for him personally and for the wider cricketing public as the Ashes is shorn, to some degree, of one of the world’s greatest ever fast bowlers. If he does manage to get on the park at some stage then it remains to be seen how quickly he can get back to his best. Cummins’ overall record in Tests already puts him in the conversation as an all-time great – 309 wickets from 71 matches. On average his wickets cost a little more than 22 runs apiece and he gets one every 47 balls. ‘Serious numbers’ is believed to be the correct statistical expression. To say England are in a better position to regain the Ashes, or even win a first Test in Australia in 14 years, without having to face Cummins goes without saying. Or not. As various pundits, journalists, players, former players and social media slingers have made that exact point this week with varying levels of sympathy, a few caveats and something bordering on unfettered glee. Zero Test wins in 14 years will do that to some. No bowler gives England’s top order more reason to panic than Pat Cummins. He has 91 wickets against England in 19 matches. No one has dismissed Joe Root more times in Tests. Who’s likely to replace him? Scott Boland. Well, there’s nothing to fear there then surely? England laid Boland and his redoubtable low to mid-80s seam to waste at home in the 2023 Ashes series. Knocking him off his nagging line and length, Boland went at nearly five runs an over and picked up only two wickets in the couple of matches he played. Root reverse ramped Boland for six in the first Test at Edgbaston, a shot that seemed to symbolise England’s new way and contrasted dramatically with how Root and the rest of England’s batters had approached Boland in Australia a couple of years earlier. In the 2021 Ashes Boland did for six English batters as the local lad ran amok in the most bashful way imaginable on his Test debut in front of a delirious home crowd at the MCG . “Build the man a statue!” went the fever pitched commentary line as Boland ripped England apart and secured the urn for Australia. Boland raised the ball to the crowd like a shy toddler unveiling a blob of plasticine after a day at nursery. Never has a man looked less like he wanted a fuss, never mind some sort of effigy. This England side won’t let Boland do that to them again, goes one school of thought. Have we learned nothing from history, goes the other. Beware the quiet man! No, we’re not talking about Iain Duncan Smith though, admittedly, the point still stands, but rather those quiet men of Ashes folklore who have a huge impact on a series. The ones who float under the radar or were barely mentioned before a ball was bowled but who quietly set about altering the course of a series and the destination of the urn. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Chris Broad wouldn’t have kept Australian fast bowlers awake at night before the 1986-87 tour but his three centuries went on to be decisive in regaining the Ashes for England. Likewise, veteran opener Chris Rogers demanded barely any column inches before the back-to-back Ashes in 2013 and 2014 but the left-hander finished as the leading run scorer from the two sides across both series. Ian Bell scored three crucial centuries in the English summer of the 2013 series but his achievements aren’t lauded as much as others seem to be. There’s no Bell’s Ashes moniker, there was no Triple Threat Bell DVD release either. Chris Woakes, another of England’s most notably humble foot soldiers played a vital hand 10 years later with 19 wickets in three Tests and important lower order runs to rescue England from 2-0 down in 2023. From the taciturn John Cornish White in the 1928-29 series to Richard Ellison in 1985, Paul Reiffel in 1993 and Stuart Clark in 2006-07, the Ashes have seen plenty of star performances from those initially unfeared. Boland may have got some tap last time around in England but his record in Australia is phenomenal – 49 wickets at 12.63. The last time he played a Test in Sydney he took 10 wickets against India. Australia will miss Cummins whenever he doesn’t play but in Boland they have a quiet man who knows how to make the ball sing in Australia.

25e15b1f566c,George Ford turns down R360 riches for last shot at England World Cup glory,,"George Ford has turned down the riches on offer from R360 for one last shot at a Rugby World Cup with England. The 32-year-old revealed he was approached by the rebel circuit , fronted by the former England centre Mike Tindall, but rejected a deal believed to be worth £1m a season to chase his dream. Ford, who reached a century of caps last summer, has signed a three-year contract extension with Sale which will ensure his availability for the 2027 World Cup in Australia. “As players, we understand what’s going on with trying to set up this new league and they did contact my agent to have discussions,” Ford said. “My decision-making was purely based on the fact that I love playing for England and I’ve got an unbelievable desire to keep playing for England. It’s the same with Sale Sharks. I’ve loved my time here. “It never really got any further than that with the conversations with the proposed new league. There were a couple of opportunities overseas but that would then mean that you’re calling time on your international career. “I’ve had three different expe­riences in the three World Cups I’ve been to. We didn’t make it out of the pool in 2015, lost the final in 2019 and lost the semi‑final and then won the third-place playoff in 2023. “They all give valuable lessons but the real reason you do it is to win trophies. That ­feeling of satisfaction that you’ve actually gone and worked hard and smart to achieve something at the end of it – it’s a massive motivation. There’s no better motivation than winning for England. It’s not just about representing England, you want to be part of a winning team.” There are no guaranteed rewards for loyalty and for all that Ford is playing some of the best rugby of his career, he acknowledges he faces stronger competition than ever for the England No 10 shirt. Fin and ­Marcus Smith were picked ahead of him by Andy Farrell for the ­British & Irish Lions and there is also the intriguing possibility of Owen ­Farrell returning to Steve Borthwick’s England squad now he is back with Saracens. “I’d imagine Steve’s quite happy having four options like that,” Ford said. He has no inside information, he insists, from his close friend Farrell over whether the former England captain does intend to put himself forward for international selection, but Ford is pleased to see him in the Prem again after his season of struggle at Racing 92. “It probably felt a bit weird last year not having Owen in the English game. It’s great to have him back and I think he’s fully settled in with his family. I know the ­influence he’ll be having at Saracens. You can just watch that over the first two or three games.” Old friends George Ford (left) and Owen Farrell face each other in the Prem when Sale meet Saracens on Saturday. Photograph: Alex Davidson/RFU/Getty Images The pair face each other on Saturday when Saracens and Sale meet at the StoneX Stadium. Ford has started the domestic season in the same imperious form he showed on England’s summer tour where he co-captained the side to a series win in Argentina. That trip underlined to him that England are assembling impressive depth at the halfway point of the World Cup cycle. He namechecks the Bath flanker Guy Pepper – “he has definitely got an unbelievable future ahead of him playing for England” – and the Gloucester centre Seb Atkinson as particularly valuable finds. skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The England head coach signed up Lee Blackett from Bath full-time and is trying to bring in Byron McGuigan from Sale on a job-share arrangement in time for the autumn Tests. Ford already knew McGuigan, the Sharks defence coach, but felt a kinship working with the attack specialist Blackett for the first time. “He came in and added unbelievably well to our attack. He has got a very positive mindset, he wants us to be dangerous and go and score some tries.” Ford, with his rugby computer of a mind, has his own ideas on how England need to evolve their attack. “The French teams are great at the unstructured side of it; the English DNA is more structured. If we can find a midpoint of that then we’ll be in a good spot.” Like his father Mike and brother Joe, he will inevitably become a coach one day. But for the time being it is all about maximising the return from his remaining years as a player in ­whatever way he can. “In recent months, I’ve been doing a lot more pilates. I know that sounds funny but what it has done to help my hip, my back, my kicking, everything has been great. We feel as rugby ­players we’re strong. When you’re in the gym you can lift weights and stuff but that has exposed a few areas in terms of weaknesses.

92c97ab5e5ed,Wales legend Jess Fishlock announces international retirement after ‘incredible journey’,,"Jess Fishlock, widely regarded as the Wales women’s national team’s greatest player, has announced she will retire from international football after the home friendly against Australia this month. The 38-year-old is Wales’s record goalscorer, despite playing predominantly as a midfielder, and their most‑capped player, with 165 international appearances and 48 goals. Perhaps even more significantly, she has played a talismanic role in the team for nearly two ­decades, frequently being the standout star, ­stepping up in their biggest matches and scoring memorable match winners. She was awarded an MBE for services to women’s football and the LGBTQ+ community in 2018. She became Wales’s first footballer to reach a century of caps in 2017. Fishlock cemented her place in the Cymru history books when she scored Wales’s first goal at a major women’s international tournament in July, finding the net against France in St Gallen, Switzerland, during a group-stage defeat at Euro 2025. “The Euros was the pinnacle of my football career; seeing the dragon on the world stage for the first time will be a memory that will stay with me for a lifetime,” Fishlock posted on social media. “To all the players and staff, past and present, diolch [thank you]. It has been an incre­dible journey.” After starting with Cardiff City, she has spent most of her career overseas, predominantly with the NWSL club Seattle Reign, whom she joined in 2013. She has helped Reign to win three NWSL shields and was named as the NWSL’s MVP in 2021, making the NWSL’s “best XI” five times. Fishlock won the Champions League with Lyon in 2019 during a loan spell, and has also had successful loans with clubs including Melbourne City and Reading. Her club career continues, with the NWSL end‑of‑season playoffs approaching. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

5daec3cb4ea7,"More rice, bigger chairs and reinforced toilets: sumo wrestling comes to London",,"T hey play Major League Baseball at the Olympic Stadium, Tottenham’s ground is a second home for the National Football League, the National Basketball Association is staging a game at the 02 Arena next year, and South Africa just beat Argentina in a rugby Test at Twickenham, but it’s been a long time since London has hosted anything on the scale of the Grand Sumo Tournament taking place at the Royal Albert Hall this week. Forty wrestlers have flown over from Japan to compete in it. That’s around six tons of elite athlete to be fed, watered, transported and supported. “We’ve actually had to source and buy new chairs which can take up to 200kg in weight,” says Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall’s harassed director of programming. “Our usual standard is only 100kg.” They’ve also had to reinforce the toilets. “It’s the ones that are screwed into the wall which are the most challenging,” Todd explains, wearily. They’ve also had to take out special insurance because “the jeopardy of having a ringside cushion is fairly substantial”. And don’t ask him about the rice bill. “It’s substantial,” he says. “I know the wholesaler actually ran out of noodles, because we’d already ordered so many from them.” Last Saturday Billy Strings was playing bluegrass here and next Monday the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra will be performing. For the week in between the two, the Royal Albert Hall has been converted into a sumo dohyõ . There’s a five-metre-wide pile of pounded clay and earth squatting in the middle of the venue, and a six-ton wooden roof, purpose-built for the occasion, suspended overhead. They have held tennis matches here, and boxing fights, even a strongman contest. “But this,” Todd says, “is, ahh, an entirely different kettle of fish to our usual programming.” The Royal Albert Hall has actually hosted a sumo tournament once before, in 1991, as part of the wider cultural festival. The venue wanted to bring it back for its 150th anniversary celebrations in 2021, but plans were ruined by the pandemic. Competitors in front of Buckingham Palace. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images The event has been a long time in the planning. It is the particular vision of two men, Martin Campbell-White, a promoter who fell in love with the sport when he visited Japan in the 1980s, and who was instrumental in organising the original event in 1991, and Hakkaku Rijicho, the rikishi who won that tournament, and who is now the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association. Yobidashi (full-time workers for the Japan Sumo Association) help prepare the dohyõ at the Royal Albert Hall. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Hakkaku has strong memories of his time in London, including, he says, the exact words of the victory speech he had to give in broken English, which he memorised so thoroughly that he is still able recite it verbatim today as his party trick. “The chairman has a real fondness for this city, and this venue in particular,” Campbell-White says. They showed the officials from the Sumo Association a few possible venues in 1991. Wembley was rejected on the grounds that it was hosting a Luther Vandross concert on the day they visited it, which, the Japanese officials felt, suggested it perhaps lacked the sort of gravitas associated with their country’s national sport. But the Albert Hall’s Royal imprimatur impressed them. Sumo tournaments don’t often travel outside Japan. There have been occasional exhibition matches in Paris, largely at the behest of the former French president Jacques Chirac, who was an avid fan, but this is only the second time that a full five-day tournament has been held overseas. “We always had an ambition to come back here,” Hakkaku says. “It is a unique, special place for me personally. I like the culture, I like the history, and I like that everyone here drives on the left.” Hakkaku says he and Campbell-White have been discussing the idea for the best part of a decade. It’s a vast operation. The Sumo Association didn’t just bring their own support staff to make the straw bales that surround the ring, and they didn’t just bring their own supply of straw for them to work with, they even brought a supply of the empty beer bottles which are traditionally used as tools to beat the bales into shape. For most of the wrestlers, this is their first visit to England. In between training, sleeping (a three-hour afternoon nap to sleep off lunch is an essential part of the regimen), fighting, and their media engagements, they have been exploring the city. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Õnosato Daiki (right) throws Hõshõryū Tomokatsu in the playoff of the Grand Sumo Autumn Tournament in Japan in September.

c04d80b57946,MPs warned over ‘shameful’ lack of funding for GB athletes at Deaflympics,,"It is shameful and discriminatory that deaf people are the only disabled community that does not receive any government funding to help them to compete in elite sport, MPs have been told. Although UK Sport will invest £330m of government and national lottery funding into British Olympic and Paralympic sport over the Los Angeles 2028 cycle, the GB team for the Deaflympics in Tokyo next month are having to raise most of the £450,000 costs themselves. That is despite the Deaflympics having been established in 1924 and been recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1955, more than three decades before the Paralympics, the culture, media and sport select committee was told. Chris Ratcliffe, the chief executive of UK Deaf Sport, said to MPs: “When it comes to elite sport, we are the only disabled elite sports group that have no access to funding whatsoever. I think that’s shameful, speaking forthrightly. “No elite deaf athletes are funded by central government for the Deaflympics, nor have they ever been. The current sports policy from the government is very clear. It supports the Olympics, it supports the Paralympics, and anything out of that remit is not funded. And we’ve been told up until now that cannot and will not change. Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

We just find it very shameful that we can get no state help for our athletes.” Radcliffe told MPs he wanted elite deaf sport in Britain to be treated equally with Olympic and Paralympic sport, and added that he would like it to receive £3m over the next four years to help it prepare for the 2029 Deaflympics. That figure is still substantially less than the £14m received by gymnastics and hockey, and the £12m given to equestrian and canoeing. The British deaf swimmer Nathan Young, told MPs that most of his competitors at the Deaflympics, which has 3,000 competitors from 80 countries, were helped financially and said that the lack of support from the government amounted to discrimination.

But when I stand on that block, and look to the left and look to my right, six out of those eight swimmers are funded. “In terms of disparities, on our journey we face roadblock after roadblock after roadblock.

2df312380738,Toronto Wolfpack players finally paid salaries after five-year battle,,"Players from the former Super League club Toronto Wolfpack have finally been paid about £750,000 in unpaid salaries after a five-year legal battle, the Guardian can reveal. The Wolfpack folded in 2020 ­during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving their playing squad – which included players such as Sonny Bill Williams – unemployed and without contracts. Some of those players were able to source deals for 2021 and continue playing, but others retired from the sport altogether and had to take jobs outside rugby league to make ends meet. Since then the squad has been attempting to reclaim six months of unpaid wages from the end of 2020. David Argyle, the club’s ­former owner, promised monthly “­goodwill” payments of about £1,150 until he was able to pay in full, but those settlements were ultimately breached, leaving the players unpaid once again. The Guardian revealed last year how legal proceedings had been launched by the Rugby League ­Players Association – a branch of the GMB Union – to recoup as much as possible of the estimated £1.2m in unpaid salaries. That has now reached a successful conclusion, with more than half that sum paid to the players who were members of the union. “It’s a huge relief for those ­players to finally get the wages they were owed for so long,” the GMB’s Pete Davies said. “But it should never have got to this stage. The Rugby Football League, supported by the top clubs, ­admitted Toronto to the Super League , but denied them any access to equal payments from TV rights. “Toronto never stood a chance. Our lead representative worked tirelessly and relentlessly with former Toronto Wolfpack owner David Argyle to finally get this deal over the line.” Adam Sidlow was arguably one of the more fortunate Toronto players, as he secured a contract with Leigh for the 2021 season before remaining in Super League with Salford Red Devils. He said: “For a transatlantic team during Covid, it would have been impossible to keep going and I was gutted when all of the hard work leading up to gaining promotion to Super League was stopped dead in its tracks and ended so abruptly. Finally the chapter can be closed.” skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The prop Anthony Mullally never played at the highest level again after  his contract with the Wolfpack was ripped up, leaving him without crucial income for a prolonged period that he has only now been able to recoup. He said: “This process has been exhausting at times, but Garreth Carvell, Pete Davies and the GMB never gave up on us. They pushed for what was right and made sure we finally got the justice we deserved. It’s a massive relief to see it settled, and it shows how important it is for players to have real union support behind them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/toronto-wolfpack-players-finally-paid-salaries-after-five-year-battle,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878131206242870e2a2ee27dca865c199f0c56e8/407_0_2685_2149/master/2685.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3f7fc77cd8faeee203fa5d49b0ab3fb",2025-10-15T07:00:17+00:00,3502145897f24cb3e4edcaf36f0bd5a19f1569ac
2ee21a1058ce,Broad brands Australia’s team as their worst since 2010 as pre-Ashes barbs fly,,"The pre-Ashes barbs continue to fly, with Stuart Broad saying that ­England will face “probably the worst ­Australian team since 2010” on tour this winter. The former England bowler’s claim was in response to David Warner – an Ashes foe of Broad’s – predicting a 4-0 victory for the hosts. “If the captain [Pat Cummins] doesn’t play, they might win one game,” Warner said. Australia have not lost a men’s Ashes match at home since England’s 3-1 victory in 2010-11. Their 5-0 win three years later – on the back of seven defeats in their previous nine Tests – was followed by 4-0 Ashes triumphs in 2017-18 and 2021-22. However, the No 1-ranked Test side, who have lost only one of their past 13 bilateral series, enter the upcoming assignment with uncertainty over the makeup of their top order and the fitness of Cummins, who is unlikely to feature in the first Test at Perth because of a back injury. “It’s very, very difficult to win in Australia as an England side, or any side,” said Broad on his podcast, For The Love Of Cricket . “Australia have to be massive favourites. “Australia are under the most pressure because they’re expected to win, they’re brilliant at home, but they’ve got question marks over their team and question marks over their captain’s fitness. You wouldn’t be outlandish in thinking – it’s actually not an opinion, it’s a fact – it’s probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won. And it’s the best English team since 2010. So those things match up to the fact that it’s going to be a brilliant Ashes series. “Australia have been so ­consistent for a long period of time that you just knew who was going to open the ­batting, who was going to bat, what bowlers there were, and they don’t have that. It’s very much a similar situation to 2010-11 when England went and won there. The fact of the matter is Australia generally have to be bad to lose in Australia and England have to be very good. England have a great chance of being very good and Australia have a decent chance of being bad.” Alastair Cook (left) scored 766 runs in the 2010-11 series in Australia during England’s last Ashes victory away from home. Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPA A question for England remains their choice at No 3, with Ollie Pope and Jacob Bethell contesting the spot. Alastair Cook, whose 766 runs set up the tourists’ series win 15 years ago, believes it would be “strange” for Ben Stokes’ side to move away from Pope, who has been a regular at first drop for the last three years. “I would bat Ollie Pope at three,” said Cook. “I think it’s quite an easy decision. You’ve got someone who’s been part of this buildup for three or four years. He’s captained the side, he’s played some extraordinary innings for England and he’s a hundred-maker. He knows how to score hundreds in first-class cricket. If you get rid of him now, I think that changes the whole dynamic of what they’ve built up over the last few years, of how settled they’ll feel, that top seven.” While hailing Bethell as “an incredibly talented player”, Cook said: “It would be a big, big gamble [to pick him] because if that doesn’t work where do you move back to, someone you’ve just got rid of? They’ve invested so much in people like Pope and [Zak] Crawley that it would be such a strange thing to change it now.” Pope has been replaced by Harry Brook as England’s vice-captain but, according to Cook, that will “take the pressure off” the Surrey right-hander. “They’ve been proactive on that, thinking if there is an injury to Ben Stokes, they’ve got a guy in Harry Brook who has taken the [captaincy of the] one-day side and everyone has seen that he seems to be well suited to it. That will just take the pressure off Ollie Pope. I don’t think it will undermine him. I’m sure it will have hurt him because anytime you get taken off a leadership thing it wouldn’t be ideal, but I don’t think it undermines him.” skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

27ffa69feb1f,‘Counterfeiting a code’: NRL announces 10-year ban for players who engage with R360,,"The NRL has vowed to ban any player who leaves the code for R360 for 10 years, as it fights to fend off the threat of the breakaway rugby competition. In a statement on Wednesday, the NRL also threatened to ban any agent if they take a player to the rebel competition. It is understood any player suspensions would not come into force until after the player has left the NRL, meaning defectors could still be free to play out 2026. The likes of Ryan Papenhuyzen, Zac Lomax, Payne Haas, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Jye Gray are among those believed to be considering moving to the competition. The NRL said the rules would apply to any competition that is not recognised as a national sporting organisation by the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC). “The Commission has a clear duty to act in the best interests of rugby league and its fans,” ARLC chair Peter V’landys said. “We will take all necessary steps to protect the future of the game. Unfortunately, there will always be organisations that seek to pirate our game for potential financial gain. “They don’t invest in pathways or the development of players. They simply exploit the hard work of others, putting players at risk of financial loss while profiting themselves. They are, in reality, counterfeiting a code.” The measures come after the NRL last week met with the 17 club bosses, who asked for action against any defecting players and their managers. Broncos premiership player Payne Haas is one player believed to be considering R360. Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images Clubs had discussed whether the rules could apply to all players who defected, or only those who broke contracts to do so. But Wednesday’s statement makes it clear that the league wants to take action against anyone who leaves for a rebel competition. V’landys has previously labelled R360 as a competition that has “come out of a corn-flakes box”, warning players risk not being paid by joining such leagues. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Australia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It comes after Rugby Australia last week banned any player who joins R360 from representing the Wallabies, with that stance taken by seven other countries. “This policy reflects the united stance of the Commission and NRL clubs,” NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo said. “We will not allow unrecognised competitions to undermine the integrity, professionalism and future of rugby league.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nrl-announces-10-year-ban-for-players-r360-rebel-rugby-league,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509cafdb716ac6c6b4a436391d48931cfd590415/61_0_3303_2643/master/3303.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95d85f86879f9249d913baee8c31c644",2025-10-15T04:25:30+00:00,b693b046276271f6acbea934959ad9f175f31430
5e1937f54daf,Aisle pay that: seat surcharges leave spectators on edge at some of Australia’s biggest events,,"Some fans hate being stepped over inside the stadium and just want to enjoy the action in peace. Others won’t sit anywhere else except the end of a row, and are prepared to pay a premium for the privilege. The extra cost of an aisle seat has reached $25 at the Melbourne Formula One Grand Prix, as part of a trend adopted at sporting events such as the MotoGP at Phillip Island and the Australian Open tennis, as well as at some music concerts, to price tickets on the edge of bays higher than those in the middle. A spokesperson for Tennis Australia confirmed aisle seat pricing was first introduced at the Melbourne Park major in 2022, with a “modest premium” of $5, “responding to fan preferences for extra legroom and easier access”. The Australian Open is placing a premium of between $5 and $15 on aisle seats for the 2026 tournament, although not all bays in all sessions carry the extra charge. Academic research, including a study published last year in the Sport Business and Management journal, has found aisle seats at sporting events are more valuable than others on the secondary market. Dr Alex Belli, a senior lecturer in marketing at the University of Melbourne, said people are prepared to pay more for easier access to toilets and food vendors, and to be able to get in and out without disturbing other patrons. “Consumers do not mind paying extra for convenience, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘convenience premium’,” he said. In one of the sideline bays on the lower bowl of Rod Laver Arena for the first 2026 Open evening session, an ordinary seat costs $319, while the two seats on either side of the stairs cost $334. A similar aisle seat on the same night at Margaret Court Arena costs $139 in a bay where seats otherwise cost $129. “Data showed aisle seats consistently sold first, confirming strong demand,” Tennis Australia’s spokesperson said. “Today, aisle seats remain equally popular as non-aisle options, with a small premium applied based on demand.” The premium at the Melbourne Grand Prix has increased to $25 per aisle seat for the 2026 race, up from $20 this year and $15 in 2023. A ticket at the Webber Stand on the Friday costs $135, but in one of the four seats at either end of a row, the cost is $160. At the MotoGP in Phillip Island this weekend, aisle seats cost $15 extra. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Australia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dynamic pricing is being adopted broadly in a range of industries, although some forms have drawn criticism including from the government . Garg said the idea of dynamic pricing was to “take out as much of the marginal profit as you can from each customer based on their willingness to pay, but that’s not usually the best approach because people want to feel like they weren’t really exploited. People want to feel like, ‘yes, you’re a business and you want to make a profit’, but they don’t want to be wrung out of every cent.” Sports could consider “bundling” costs – or avoiding splitting separate charges – to prevent consumer resentment, Garg said, or look to the example of airlines and use loyalty programs to offer the choice of aisle seats as a reward. The practice of applying aisle premiums has also been evident at music concerts, and was first widely reported by Billboard magazine in 2019 . Not all sports are wedded to the aisle premium. Those who have watched a day of Test cricket are familiar with the increasing tempo of patrons’ bathroom breaks into the afternoon session and the challenge for some to navigate out of a row.

e252eb84ea8a,NFL bets big on Saudi Arabia with Tom Brady-led flag football showcase,,"The National Football League is making a significant move to raise its global profile after years of struggling to expand beyond its domestic roots. The league announced last week that the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, headlined by seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady , will take place on 21 March 2026, at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The showcase event is expected to serve as a major lead-in to flag football’s debut at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where the NFL hopes the sport’s inclusion will accelerate its growth worldwide. Produced by OBB Media and Fanatics, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic will feature a round-robin tournament with three teams composed of former NFL greats and current stars, including Saquon Barkley (Philadelphia Eagles), CeeDee Lamb (Dallas Cowboys), Christian McCaffrey (San Francisco 49ers), Sauce Gardner (New York Jets), Brock Bowers (Las Vegas Raiders), Maxx Crosby (Las Vegas Raiders), Tyreek Hill (Miami Dolphins) and Myles Garrett (Cleveland Browns). “I have always admired the power of flag football and how it connects fans of all ages, and it’s awesome to be able to showcase the sport on such a global stage while joining together so many incredibly skilled athletes,” Brady said in a press release. Organizers said additional participants from other sports and the entertainment industry will be announced later. The event will feature three teams of eight players facing off in a round-robin tournament, with the top two advancing to a championship game. It will air live on FOX Sports and Tubi, with actor and comedian Kevin Hart serving as host. Garrett, one of the NFL’s premier defensive players, said his decision to participate stems from a desire to help expand the game’s reach. “Just like every other sport has grown worldwide, we want to make [American football] the world’s game,” Garrett told the Guardian. “We’re proud to be ambassadors for this beautiful game that we love.” The NFL’s move comes as Saudi Arabia continues to expand its influence in global sports, investing billions of dollars to bring major events and athletes to the kingdom. Its push has included the launch of LIV Golf in 2022, lucrative deals to attract some of the world’s top soccer players, and high-profile boxing matches – all part of a broader effort to reshape its global image through sports. The Guardian’s Rob Booth tries out flag football in London last year. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian There was hesitation by many athletes then to participate, and Saudi Arabia faced intense criticism in 2022 when it launched LIV Golf, a rival league to the PGA Tour backed by its sovereign wealth fund. Now the PGA and LIV have a working agreement. Garrett said there are always challenges when starting something new. “That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it,” he said. “You should take that into account and find a way to make yourself different and still appealing. We’re trying to do that. We still love the game here, but we want to see it grow and find new areas of talent.” For Garrett, it’s another chance to showcase his sport on a global stage. But for critics, it’s part of a much bigger debate about what role Saudi Arabia – and its billions – should play in the world of sports. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sport in Focus Sign up to Sport in Focus Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet even amid those concerns, the NFL’s ambitions stretch beyond any single event or country. The Riyadh showcase isn’t just about one night of football in the desert; it’s part of a long-term push to transform a uniquely American game into a truly global sport. And with flag football poised to enter the Olympics, the stakes are far larger than a single exhibition. For the league, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic could mark the start of a new chapter – one where flag football becomes a global phenomenon and the NFL’s future is no longer confined to American shores and a handful of international games during the regular season. “This will be the ultimate celebration for football fans everywhere and introduce a whole new audience to America’s most popular game,” said Michael D Ratner, OBB Media Founder and CEO, in a press release. “Flag football is the fastest-growing sport in the world, and with [Olympics 2028] on the horizon, the timing couldn’t be better to showcase it on a global stage.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bad96b63b2e272fbd7251cc03caed072858b86ed/515_0_4985_3988/master/4985.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b28be6db5e8e88b33bd15cc40333ef8b",2025-10-15T09:00:32+00:00,d6a67fdd23981186a2bc27e855e74f00b6132efc
bcaeecdaa4b8,No jeopardy in Riga: the real tests for Thomas Tuchel’s England lie ahead,,"As Harry Kane stepped up to make it 3-0 to England with the final kick of the first half at a wet, chilly and deflated Daugava Stadium it was strange to think that there was a time when the very act of reaching a major tournament was an event in its own right. It is not supposed to be this much of a doddle. Qualifying was once a nerve-shredding experience. It could make or break reputations and even provided some of the most iconic moments in the history of English football: the euphoria of David Beckham’s free-kick against Greece in 2001, the bloody‑minded defiance of Paul Ince in Rome in 1997 or, at the other end of the spectrum, the farce of Steve McClaren’s umbrella at Wembley in 2007, the agony of Graham Taylor in Rotterdam in 1993 and the shock of Jan Tomaszewski’s heroics in goal for Poland against Sir Alf Ramsey’s England in 1973. Yet there was no jeopardy in Riga on Tuesday night. That England would thump Latvia and secure their place at the World Cup finals tournament next summer with two games to spare was never in doubt. It was all very predictable. It took England until the 26th minute to pick the lock, Anthony Gordon scoring the goal his lively performance on the left flank deserved, but not once have they been in trouble in Group K. The opposition has been feeble. The results – 2-0, 3-0, 1-0, 2-0, 5-0, 5-0 – say it all. And so is it any surprise that victory against Latvia , the 137th best team in the world, was greeted with little more than a shrug of the shoulders? Nobody could blame the travelling fans for leaving long before the end. Not even Thomas Tuchel, that renowned thrower of truth bombs, was going to question the level of support this time. It would have been an unwise move. Tuchel heard the away end aiming a string of critical chants in his direction during the first half. Those comments from the head coach about the soporific atmosphere during England’s friendly win against Wales at Wembley last Thursday have been noted by the hardcore support. There were even a few boos for Tuchel when his name was read out before kick-off here. Eberechi Eze increases the competition for places in attack. Photograph: Gints Ivuskans/AFP/Getty Images Yet while Tommy Tuchel’s army did not sound best pleased with their manager, they will have appreciated his team’s football again. England were efficient, controlled and clinical. They look structured and balanced. Elliot Anderson was excellent again at the base of midfield. Kane keeps scoring and keeps standards high. John Stones, who looks guaranteed to start in central defence as long as he stays fit, got through another 71 minutes. He also made the first goal, capitalising on one of the few moments Latvia dared push up by lifting a long ball over the top for Gordon to cut in from the left and whip a shot into the far corner. This was a good night for Gordon. He drove at Raivis Jurkovskis, who was probably relieved to be taken off at half-time. There was a lot of focus on Marcus Rashford during the buildup but Gordon has the shirt at the moment. His directness and willingness to run behind defences are crucial assets given Kane’s ability to drop deep. “This is his biggest strength – to go direct,” Tuchel said. “He collects high-intensity runs and this is so good. We are playing a high press. He is important against the ball. Another good performance.” The competition in attack is fierce. Eberechi Eze came off the bench to make it 5-0. Morgan Rogers, the kind of counter-pressing No 10 Tuchel likes, has made three consecutive starts, and Noni Madueke’s knee injury has allowed Bukayo Saka to return on the right. Now, though, the real work begins. England were not even stretched when they went to Serbia last month. Andorra and Albania were also dispatched with relative ease. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania next month. There will be warm-up friendlies in March – Japan and Uruguay have been lined up – but nothing so far will have told Tuchel if England are equipped to beat Spain or France in a knockout game. This is where the real work begins. There are questions to resolve. Does the great humbling of Jude Bellingham continue, or does the Real Madrid midfielder return next month? Is there space for Cole Palmer or Phil Foden in attack? Can Adam Wharton find his way back? The picture will become clearer as the tournament approaches. It still feels unlikely that England can win the World Cup without Bellingham but it is up to the 22-year-old to prove that he can respect the hierarchy and follow instructions.

92894ca68dce,Scouts’ honour: ‘I think many believe the job is like Football Manager’,,"“I once travelled from Greece to Denmark to scout a goalkeeper. I went straight from the airport to the stadium, only for him to face zero shots. After away fans rioted, the match was abandoned, and the police had to intervene. My phone battery died, and I only made it to my hotel late at night, just in time for four hours of sleep before flying back. Despite the chaos, that game still provided valuable insights: I saw first-hand how much the home fans adored the player and observed his leadership and quality, even if all his shot-stopping happened in the warm-up.” Here, then, is the life of those involved in one of the most misunderstood aspects of the game. Their stories reveal a side of football that rarely makes headlines – one of adaptability, forbearance, and sometimes, outright audacity. Misconceptions about the role of a scout remain widespread. “I’ve never played it but I think many believe the job’s like Football Manager: you just go to watch games, pick multimillion pound players, and enjoy the travelling and nice hotels,” said one scout. “When people think about South America, they imagine scouts swanning around the continent, sweating in hot, dingy stadiums and sending reports,” said another. “The reality is that hundreds of European clubs are aware of the same players having watched hours of video and studied mountains of data. Those that get the credit are simply more proactive, but that’s down to structure rather than player identification.” Many believe scouts have a crystal ball when it comes to identifying which players are destined to succeed. A scout working at grassroots level lamented that “there is [a belief that] a blueprint for finding talent [exists], and that if you work for the top teams, you will get it right every time. [But] mistakes happen. We are expected to make predictions on players that, in reality, we don’t know enough about. “When scouting across lower age groups, parents assume scouts have all the information when this is simply not true. I would often go to games with nothing more than a name and, if I was lucky, their position. The first half of every under-18 game I attended was spent working out who was who.” The shift toward data-driven scouting, combined with the greater use of video scouts, has transformed talent identification. Those with university degrees are edging out those with field experience. Yet this growing reliance on technology remains contentious. A scout at one of the Premier League’s biggest clubs said: “This method is now well-established but it has massive limitations. I was at a match when I saw a player do something that was spectacularly difficult. There was a swirling wind and he brought down a high ball to hit a wonderful pass. I was really excited about watching this later on video but from the angle it was filmed, it failed to capture the brilliance. It was an unbelievably high-quality first-touch pass, but you couldn’t tell that it was incredibly windy.” “It’s moments like these that you’re looking for ,” he added. “A 15-year-old diamond that can do something different, but it just didn’t look as good on video. It’s the same at, say, a match in Quito [in Ecuador]. If a video analyst has never experienced what it’s like operating at altitude they are simply not qualified to do a meaningful report. It took it out of me just walking to the stadium.” A scout makes notes during a 2023 EFL Trophy match between MK Dons and Chelsea Under-21s. Photograph: Leila Coker/Shutterstock A scout’s unique insights remain vital. Despite the efforts of clubs to measure every aspect of the game, unpredictability and randomness endure. Above all, football is a business driven by raw emotions. “I loved being a modern gladiator,” proclaimed the former Germany international Thomas Müller after his final outing for Bayern Munich. These human elements will never disappear, though the number of scouts involved will likely be streamlined even further, and the role might be reduced to confirming what the stats appear to indicate. WhatsApp groups are full of yarns of the “one who got away” and talent “spotted in a park” driving back from a match. One of my favourite anecdotes comes from a scout in Australia: “I go early to games and do some research at a local watering hole. As it happened, the player I was meant to be watching turned up at the bar. I asked him why he wasn’t playing and he said he had taken a knock in training. He then had a curry and a few beers before heading off. Later, I was in the stands, and the footballer ran out with the team and was the man-of-the-match, scoring the winning goal. I did my report but I kept quiet about the two pints and biryani. He turned pro and had a long career, which still blows me away.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was so poor I couldn’t afford hotels for the late, midweek games or rent a car for the long-distance matches. The German club wouldn’t pay expenses, but I had a plan. I’d go in my everyday clothes, but in my backpack I had a Gaviões da Fiel shirt – the hardcore Corinthians supporters group, people you don’t mess with. “After the game I put on the shirt and found a supporters’ bus going near my home, which meant a few hours singing and drinking with them. Another time, I went both ways on a Palmeiras ultras’ bus. I wore a Palmeiras top but the Corinthians shirt was still in the backpack. The two fan groups are huge rivals and I was fortunate that no one looked in my bag. If they had done, I’d have been in serious trouble. It was very risky, but I was prepared to do anything to become a scout.” Technology’s rapid development promises a future where machine learning and AI revolutionise talent identification, making scouting more data-driven than ever. Some of the book’s contributors embrace these innovations. Many others mourn the potential loss of old-fashioned eagle-eyed spotters. This is an edited extract from Scouts’ Stories: A Life in the Shadows, by Jon Cotterill",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/15/scouts-stories-book-extract-many-believe-job-like-football-manager,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7f3efef4d51d04516c9baa64c91505bd905ecd2/464_7_1566_1253/master/1566.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef11872b938fabbfd0c8f9598cba6b38",2025-10-15T11:30:35+00:00,2a3d2f8ba522a5c20c8434aa23d1360e9300ee67
153f6c645d33,"Long games, less action: how much is the ball in play in the Premier League?",,"T he start of every football match brings a little flutter in the stomach. Will the stars perform? Will the referee have a good game by giving your players every decision? And will the football gods shine down on your team? A more pertinent question to ask this season, though, is how much football will we actually see? We wrote about ball-in-play time a few seasons ago , revealing that fans were not seeing as much football as in previous years. We’re not saying our data nosiness led to referees adding more stoppage time, but there was a notable rise in ball-in-play time over the next two campaigns. It went up from 54 minutes and 49 seconds in 2022-23 to 58 minutes and 11 seconds in 2023-24. It’s still early in the 2025-26 season, but the pendulum may be swinging back the other way. How much is the ball in play in 2025-26? We have seen an average ball-in-play time of just 55 minutes per game this season – down from 56 minutes and 59 seconds last season. Stoppage time has crept up – games last 100 minutes and 35 seconds on average this season, which is 51 seconds longer than last season – but the ball is in play for almost two minutes fewer. Fans are spending two minutes and 50 seconds longer than last season waiting for restarts, roughly the time it takes to listen to You’re the One That I Want by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. There are 45 minutes and 35 seconds of delays/pauses per game this season – or roughly one episode of Countdown. We could be struggling to solve a conundrum rather than watching someone saunter over slowly to take a corner. For clarity, a “delay” is the time between the ball going out and play resuming for corners, free-kicks, throw-ins, goal-kicks, kick-offs, penalties and drop balls. The ball has been in play for just 54.7% of the time this season; the lowest it’s been over the past 10 full seasons is 55.7%, which was in 2022-23. So, which teams are giving us the most action? Despite being recently promoted and considered underdogs in most of their games, Leeds are averaging the longest ball-in-play time in the league this season at 56 minutes and 48 seconds (57.5% of total minutes). It either means Daniel Farke is happy for his side to get on with it, or their opponents are doing their utmost to keep the ball in play. Newcastle games have the lowest proportion of ball-in-play action at 52.3% (53 minutes and nine seconds on average), closely followed by Chelsea (52.6%) and Manchester United (52.7%). One match in particular has dragged Newcastle’s numbers down. The longest shortest game Newcastle’s five-goal thriller against Liverpool has the lowest ball-in-play time this season, which is quite something when you consider it lasted 109 minutes and 24 seconds – the third longest match of the season so far. There were 31 fouls, the joint-second most in a Premier League match this term, which created delays of 27 minutes and seven seconds. Newcastle averaged 67 seconds per free-kick, at least 10 seconds longer than any other team has averaged in a game. There was 13 minutes and 43 seconds of stoppage time in the second half, the most in a Premier League match this season. Despite the added time, the ball was in play for just 45 minutes and 55 seconds (42%). So, for 63 minutes and 29 seconds of that game, nothing was happening. It’s astonishing to think there were five goals, including Rio Ngumoha’s late winner for Liverpool . Not far behind was Brighton’s 3-1 win at Chelsea , when the ball was in play for just 46 minutes and 44 seconds of the total time of 105 minutes and 14 seconds (44.4%). At the other end of the value-for-money scale, the ball was in play for 63.4% of Leeds’ 3-1 win at Wolves . Who are the slowest at set-pieces? Sunderland are spending the most time over each corner, with almost 50 seconds per corner. Arsenal, who topped this list last season and are second this term, have won more corners than any other team this season (53) so are comfortably ahead when it comes to total time to take them. Mikel Arteta’s team have spent 40 minutes and six seconds taking corners this season – at least 11 minutes and 12 seconds more than any other team. All three goals in their recent game against Newcastle were scored from corners, which wasn’t that surprising considering 19 corners were awarded in the game. In total, 12 minutes and 14 seconds of that game was taken up by delays for taking corners, the most in a match this season. Wolves are the quickest to take their corners, closely followed by Manchester City, who both average less than 30 seconds. There is not any clear correlation between time taken over corners and their effectiveness. Arsenal take the second longest time and have scored the most goals from corners this season (six), but Chelsea have scored the second most (five) despite taking the third shortest time. Sunderland and Wolves, who are at either end of the spectrum, have scored one each. Manchester City (29.1 seconds) are yet to score from a corner, but so are Liverpool (40.6 seconds). Compared to last season, teams are generally spending more time taking corners, goal-kicks and throw-ins. Given the number of long throws we’re seeing , that is no surprise, with throw-ins taking an average of 17.7 seconds this season compared to 15.6 seconds last term. Goal-kicks are also taking two seconds longer (30.3 seconds, up from 28.3 seconds), but corners have seen the most noticeable jump, up to 36.9 seconds from 33.6 seconds. With each corner taking 3.3 seconds longer on average, if we end up seeing the same number as last season (3,890), we will have spent more than three and a half hours extra waiting for them across the campaign. Brentford are taking almost four seconds longer than any other team on throw-ins. This is largely because so many of them are long – the Bees have taken 34 long throws into the opposition’s box, more than any other team – so they generally take more time to line everything up. Wolves are taking almost half the time on average, just 12.7 seconds per throw-in, the quickest in the division. Sunderland are taking the longest over goal-kicks (36.7 seconds) and Nottingham Forest are the quickest. They have needed just 26.2 seconds per goal-kick, a steep decline from last season when their average of 34.1 seconds was the longest in the division. Free-kicks can be tricky to read, as they depend on where they are won. Deep inside your own half and chances are you’ll take it quickly, but within 10-20 yards of the opposition’s box and you’re far more likely to take your time lining up a cross or shot. For what it’s worth, Crystal Palace (41.6 seconds) and Brentford (41.0 seconds) spend the longest average time taking free-kicks, while Fulham (25.8 seconds), Brighton (26.8 seconds) and Liverpool (26.9 seconds) take them quickest. Not so busy Bees Taking all delays into account, Brentford are spending the most time getting the ball back into play, taking 33.5 seconds on average to do so. They are closely followed by promoted pair Burnley (32.7 seconds) and Sunderland (32.3 seconds), but also not far behind are Arsenal and Manchester United (both 31 seconds). Wolves are the fastest at getting the game going again (24.1 seconds). Given that they are bottom of the Premier League with just two points after seven games, perhaps they should consider slowing down a bit. Manchester City (25.6 seconds), Nottingham Forest (26.4 seconds) and Liverpool (26.8 seconds) are also eager to get the ball back in play. Again, that is a big change from Forest, who were the slowest in the league last season at restarting play (32.2 seconds). So, there you have it. We are getting some of the longest football matches we have ever seen in the Premier League, but we’re not seeing more football, unless you enjoy the sight of a player with the ball under his arm waiting for teammates to flood the box. We’re not here to judge.

Chile sealed their second consecutive appearance at the tournament with a sensational playoff win against Samoa last month, leaving a single spot to be won for Australia in two years’ time. On Saturday Paraguay stunned Brazil 39-19 in the first leg of their playoff. The second leg takes place this Saturday in Jacareí, near São Paulo, as Brazil’s men attempt to emulate the women and qualify for the first time. Whether Paraguay complete a surprise aggregate win, or Brazil recover in the wake of the head coach Emiliano Caffera’s recent dismissal, the lineup for next month’s Dubai qualification tournament will then be locked in. Namibia, Belgium and Samoa are already confirmed for the Middle Eastern showdown from 8-18 November. There are plenty of moving parts and subplots. Hong Kong China sealed their first qualification after beating Korea 70-22 in July, while Zimbabwe will return to rugby union’s most prestigious stage for the first time since 1991 by virtue of winning the Rugby Africa Cup. The knock-on effect of Chile’s playoff success, meanwhile, is that Los Condores will play Italy for the first time next month in the autumn internationals, due to Samoa’s pressing appointment in Dubai. Alan Gilpin, the World Rugby chief executive, called Chile an “exciting and fast-emerging force” in announcing the fixture in Genoa. As the Prem’s marketing team continues its quest for bums on seats, Chilean rugby is buoyant. A capacity crowd of more than 20,000 witnessed the playoff win in Viña del Mar and the head coach, Pablo Lemoine, has had the team on an upward trajectory since taking over in 2018. The 50-year-old former Uruguay international prop has been making an impact for decades: signed by Bob Dwyer for Bristol in the late 90s, he ran straight through Danny Grewcock to score against England at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. His influence as national coach has been similarly powerful: Chile have climbed to 17th in the world rankings, their highest position. In France two years ago they were beaten four times, conceding 215 points and scoring 27, including a 71-0 defeat against England and five-try Henry Arundell. Still they proudly took the positives, and after the draw for 2027 in Sydney on 3 December Lemoine can start planning in earnest. They hosted Scotland last year, defeated 52-11 in front of 24,000 fans, and although they were beaten across two legs by Uruguay in the initial 2027 playoff, they won 21-18 away in Montevideo. Despair for Samoa’s players after defeat by Chile left their qualifying hopes in doubt. Photograph: Javier Torres/AFP/Getty Images Samoa, meanwhile, have not missed a Rugby World Cup since 1991, but are languishing in 16th place in the men’s rankings. They were winless in this year’s Pacific Nations Cup, leading to playoff misery against Chile, and the obligation to meet the likes of Belgium heaps indignity on a proud rugby nation. The former fly-half Tusi Pisi was appointed head coach in April and the towering Saracens lock Theo McFarland is captain, but he was injured for most of the Pacific Nations Cup, and remains sidelined for his club. skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the first time there will be a round of 16, with six pools of four rather than four pools of five. Pool-stage jeopardy is significantly reduced because the four best third-placed teams will qualify. The hosts, Australia, are now ranked seventh in the world, meaning they would miss out on top seeding and meet one of South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, France, England or Argentina in Pool A. They could climb into the top six during a busy November, however: England, Italy, Ireland and France are their opponents, with a fixture against Japan in Tokyo also on 25 October. Wales, meanwhile, are teetering in 12th, with Japan below, and the implications of dropping to 13th and into pot three are potentially severe. Another new dimension for 2027 is the presence of five teams from the Americas: Argentina, Uruguay, USA, Canada and the aforementioned Chile: Paraguay or Brazil would make it six. From World Rugby’s perspective American interest is no bad thing, with the 2031 tournament to be hosted by the USA, and the process to select a host for 2035 was launched by the global governing body last month. First things first, though. The second instalment of Brazil v Paraguay sets up a four-way Dubai shootout, along with a potential rankings shake-up across Europe in November. No matter how things pan out, Chile’s qualification for a second Rugby World Cup has already made them a resounding success story.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/14/south-american-rugby-success-stories-propel-world-cup-qualifying-the-breakdown,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c276f531dc586ef4ef72af2f4a6cfbd479097497/888_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad571b90618a273a1882fe9a732629c9",2025-10-14T09:24:16+00:00,799c0ce8aa4f37b49dab5f596589f48144082c2e
bb65bdd670d0,Which footballers have scored most of their career goals in a single match?,,"“Last month, Jeremy Ngakia scored twice for Watford against Oxford to take his career goals total to three from 116 senior club appearances. Excluding players who scored only once, has anybody with 100+ appearances managed a higher percentage of their career goals in a single match?” wonders Peter Skilton. Denis Boone writes in with the tale of Matthieu Chalmé. “French right-back Chalmé played 362 professional matches during his career, mostly for Lille and Bordeaux,” Denis writes. “He scored four career goals, with three of them coming in a single game. Chalmé netted all three goals in Lille’s 3-0 win at Ajaccio in March 2004, recording the most unlikely of hat-tricks.” Those three well-taken goals in Corsica were the only ones Chalmé managed in 179 Lille appearances, while in 167 for Bordeaux, he scored once. Well, twice if you count his own goal in the 2010 Coupe de la Ligue final against Marseille. Scoring 75% of his career goals in one game takes Chalmé past Ngakia’s mark (66.7%), but there is a fly in the ointment. Chalmé hung up his boots at Bordeaux in July 2014 after a loan spell at Ajaccio, who presumably recalled his brief purple patch a decade earlier. He did return to football with fifth-tier side Lège Cap-Ferret, playing seven games in six months – and scoring one goal. That would drop Chalmé’s percentage of goals scored in a single game down to 60%, but it feels harsh to penalise him for a post-retirement jaunt at semi-professional level. A quick mention, too, for another French full-back: Lilian Thuram. While the original question relates to club careers, plenty of you emailed in to point out that Thuram made 142 France appearances and scored two goals in the same match – the World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 1998 . Look, when you’re hot, you’re hot. The Insubordination Files: Part II In last week’s Knowledge we looked at players who defied their managers’ instructions. There are some more fantastic examples, so let’s reopen the Insubordination Files for a second look. Tottenham v Manchester City, FA Cup semi-final, 1955-56 “The Spurs captain, Danny Blanchflower, made changes to the team during the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City while they were losing 1-0, moving Maurice Norman from centre-half to up front,” writes John Tumbridge. “Spurs still lost and the manager, Jimmy Anderson [not that one], dropped Blanchflower for the next match and stripped him of the captaincy. Within a year Anderson was out of the job, Bill Nicholson took over, Blanchflower was reinstated and the rest is history.” Spurs legend Danny Blanchflower: an early exponent of player power. Photograph: Smith Archive/Alamy England v Albania, World Cup 1990 qualifier, April 1989 Adam Clark points out: “Paul Gascoigne scored his first England goal in this 5-0 win at Wembley after playing ‘all over the pitch, except the position I told him to play in’, according to manager Bobby Robson. The post-match interview is marvellous – a wonderful mixture of frustration, sarcasm and paternal pride.” Everton v Tottenham, FA Cup semi-final, 1994-95 “Everton’s last major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup, and it wouldn’t have been possible without one man,” begins Jim Hearson. “Manager Joe Royle? Nah. Goalscorer in the final, Paul Rideout? Close, but no. Goalkeeping colossus, Neville Southall? Nope. That man was mercurial striker Daniel Amokachi, who substituted himself on during the semi-final against Spurs , scoring twice to earn the Toffees a place in the Wembley showpiece against Manchester United.” Daniel Amokachi (front) celebrates Everton’s FA Cup triumph in 1995 after a crucial intervention in the semi-finals. Photograph: Getty Images/Hulton Archive Recounting the story to the BBC, Amokachi, said: “Rideout got a knock and went down ... I just went to Willie [Donachie, Everton’s assistant manager] and told him ‘The gaffer says you need me on’.” Royle was understandably furious at the time, but more forgiving at the final whistle: “He came into the locker room and hugged me, gave me his hand and said: ‘Well done, son, but never try that again.’” Sporting v Barcelona, Champions League group stage, 2008-09 “While playing for Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona against Sporting Lisbon, Thierry Henry took it upon himself to switch wings. He quickly scored to ensure Barça went in 1-0 up at half-time. Guardiola’s reaction? He hooked Henry for ignoring his instructions.” You can watch Titi recount the tale from 5:15 in this video . Free-kick flurries “As a West Ham fan I’m increasingly having to look at past seasons for some enjoyment,” weeps Liam Corbett. “While recently doing so, I noticed that Dimitri Payet scored six free kicks in the 18 cherished months that we had him. Just wondering if there is a more prolific free-kick taker in a similar time period?” One comes to mind: David Beckham scored 27 free-kicks in his time at Manchester United, including eight in as many months between March and November 2000. His most prolific 18-month spell at Old Trafford includes the same period: from May 1999 to November 2000, Beckham scored 10 direct-free-kicks – including two raspers against the Hammers. Sorry, Liam. David Beckham, doing his dead-ball thing in the Champions League. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters If it helps, there’s a player currently on West Ham’s books who can better Payet’s statistics: James Ward-Prowse. The set-piece maestro enjoyed two purple patches with Southampton, scoring seven free kicks between November 2019 and February 2021 across two Covid-affected seasons. Ward-Prowse then hit another six dead-ball beauties in a 10-month spell between April 2022 and February 2023. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is he having me on?” asked Stuart Jacks in April 2012. Ludicrously, he wasn’t. Southend were one of two teams – Brentford being the other – to play against Clapton Orient in Division Three (South) at Wembley back in 1930, owing to ground improvement work at Orient’s Lea Bridge Stadium. Their official website takes up the story: Following a league match against Torquay (which the O’s won), officials from the Devon club complained about the perimeter fence being too close to the pitch. The Football League was duly asked to inspect the ground and agreed that alterations had to be made before any more games could take place; suddenly the Orient found themselves without a stadium to play in. Incredible as it seems, Wembley was suggested and the O’s actually played two league games in 1930 against Brentford and Southend United, winning 3-0 and 3-1 respectively. To this day the Orient is the only Football League side to have played home games at Wembley Stadium! Since then of course, Tottenham joined Orient in becoming residents at Wembley, albeit in the Premier League. In recent weeks, talk of Arsenal upgrading the Emirates – and relocating to the national stadium while the work is carried out – has emerged. Knowledge link. Can you help? “Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored four goals and was sent off in Gabon’s 4-3 win over Gambia last week,” writes Seb in Berlin. “Which other players have seen red after scoring at least three goals?” “In Austria’s 10-0 demolition of San Marino, every outfield player who started got a goal, an assist or both. Has any other team managed this?” asks Paul Savage. And four goals were scored by Marko Arnautovic. Photograph: Guenther Iby/Getty Images “Of all of the players who have a statue outside the ground of their former club, who made the least amount of appearances for that team?” wonders Masai Graham. “Remarkably, Jon Dahl Tomasson is the first manager to be sacked by Sweden,” writes Gregg Bakowski. “Have any other nations – or clubs – never sacked a manager?” “I read that, when the Netherlands conceded two goals to Lithuania recently, they were the lowest Fifa-ranked country to score against them (143rd). The Netherlands are currently ranked seventh which means a difference of 136 places between the two countries. I have two questions upon hearing this – which is the lowest-ranked team to score against England (since rankings began in 1992) and what is the biggest difference between teams where the lower ranked team has scored? I was thinking of the respective rankings at the time the matches took place rather than current rankings” – Pete Tomlin. “Como and Milan’s stadiums are just 28 miles apart, but if their Serie A match goes ahead in Perth, Australia in February, both teams will travel 8,480 miles as the crow flies,” notes Paul Vickers. “Are there any other examples of matches being played a long way from either team’s home ground – including internationals but not major finals held in one nation?”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/15/which-footballers-have-scored-most-of-their-career-goals-in-a-single-match-knowledge,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2c1f24d8d8841fa449dc1fe26cc74df4586012/45_0_2265_1813/master/2265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e0e295f6bed53b09c8aa82f2403f204",2025-10-15T07:00:16+00:00,151a27b124a6606068160e2ad1f931dc6a8f94ca

b55a3627768a,USWNT great Christen Press to retire at end of 2025 NWSL season,,"One of the most electrifying players in US women’s soccer has called it a career. Christen Press, who starred for the US women’s national team over 155 appearances from 2013 to 2021, announced on Wednesday that she would be retiring as a player at the conclusion of the 2025 NWSL season with Angel City FC . Press, 36, shared the news in an interview on ABC morning show Good Morning America. “I feel a mix of everything,” she said. “There’s relief, there’s joy, there’s excitement, there’s fear, there’s so much grief. I have so much grief, a part of me, a piece of me, I’m losing her.” Like most women’s soccer players of her generation, Press enjoyed a meandering professional club career that started in Florida with MagicJack in Women’s Professional Soccer (WPS). When that league folded, Press moved to Sweden with Kopparbergs/Göteborg FC and Tyresö before returning stateside in the newly launched NWSL with the Utah Royals and Chicago Red Stars. She made 14 appearances for Manchester United in the 2020-21 WSL season, but returned to her home town of Los Angeles for the launch of Angel City in 2022. Press will be remembered most for her national team career, which saw her play a key role in the United States’ triumphs in the 2015 and 2019 Women’s World Cups. Whether as a starter or an effective substitute, Press’ speed, finishing and ability with the ball at her feet was a key component of those teams. In total, Press scored 64 goals for the US national team – one more than teammate Megan Rapinoe and good for ninth on the all-time scoring charts for the US. Press’s later playing career was unfortunately marked by a extended injury struggles and a sudden absence from the USWNT picture. Shortly before making that move to LA, Press took a break from the US national team for mental health reasons, and then-head coach Vlatko Andonovski left her off his US rosters after she said she was available to return in 2022. Press tore her ACL in June of 2022 – an injury that ended up requiring multiple surgeries to fully repair. In total, the injury kept Press out of action until the 2024 season and effectively ended her national team career, though her comeback with Angel City has been hailed as inspiring by many across the world of women’s soccer. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Heath, Press’ teammate with the US, retired earlier in 2025. “She would absolutely hate me saying this, but a lot,” she said of whether Heath’s decision contributed to her own retirement. “I think it is time for my family to move on to our next chapter, we’re going to be a part of this game forever, but it’s time for it to look different for us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/15/christen-press-uswnt-retires-angel-city-manchester-united,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b6f350acca65cca1fe1ea83ff785506af47a5a/775_0_3875_3100/master/3875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00f390d9057e938d8e3a88708b445988",2025-10-15T14:11:11+00:00,bfc75609bfd13a63f99d10c7a603aa39624fd7cc
1923b6cb57b3,World Cup qualifying roundup: Portugal and record-breaking Ronaldo denied by Hungary,,"Cristiano Ronaldo set a record for World Cup qualifying goals but the Group F leaders Portugal were denied early World Cup qualification by a late Hungary equaliser to snatch a 2-2 draw. Two Ronaldo goals – the first his 40th in qualifying to set the landmark – put Portugal on the verge of qualification but Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai struck in added time to stop the celebration party in Lisbon. Portugal’s next chance to confirm their place in the World Cup finals tournament next year will be against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin next month. Evan Ferguson’s fourth goal in five competitive internationals kept the Republic of Ireland ’s World Cup dream alive as they edged past 10-man Armenia to claim their first Group F victory. The head coach, Heimir Hallgrímsson, had admitted in advance that he would accept a “shitty” performance and a 1-0 win on a night when victory was the only option, and Ireland eventually delivered – if only just – as they made the most of Tigran Barseghyan’s senseless second-half dismissal for a headbutt on Finn Azaz. Ferguson, who had passed up a glorious opportunity to open the scoring seconds earlier, dispatched a 70th-minute header to seal a 1-0 win at the Aviva Stadium and ensure Portugal’s visit to Dublin and the trip to Hungary which follows it are meaningful, if daunting. Italy kept alive their hopes of qualifying automatically with a 3-0 win against Israel courtesy of two goals from Mateo Retegui and a late header from Gianluca Mancini in Udine. The Italians remain three points behind the Group I leaders Norway, whom they meet at home next month. The bottom two teams, Estonia and Moldova , drew 1-1. England have won Group K but Serbia remain in the hunt for second place after beating Andorra 3-1 with Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic both on the scoresheet.

845fcb7ca24c,"The USMNT, at long last and just in time, have tangible momentum before World Cup 2026",,"Not all that long ago, that first half hour would have done the Americans in. The United States men’s national team started Tuesday’s friendly with Australia looking flat, lacking spark, unable to find their way through the press. They gave away a soft, sloppy goal on a series of defensive miscues – off a throw-in no less. It was the eighth time in Mauricio Pochettino’s 20 matches in charge that the US fell behind. They had never salvaged a win from the previous seven and gotten only two ties. Then they lost Christian Pulisic to injury when he felt his hamstring pull. Then, the Yanks got their acts together. There was a swerving warning shot from Tim Weah. And then a Haji Wright goal in the 33rd minute on a lovely through ball by Cristian Roldan, poking a tidy finish past Maty Ryan. Some chippy late Australian tackles that failed to rattle the Americans. And then, in the 51st minute, Wright’s second goal – the Coventry City man’s 11th in 11 matches for club and country, bringing the game to its final: 2-1. The US had chances to run up the score. Roldan had a few close efforts. Diego Luna was denied point-blank by Ryan. Aidan Morris had a late chance off a mazy dribble but rolled his finish wide. The gutsy turnaround combined all of the things Pochettino has been demanding to see. In beating an Australia side that had not lost in a dozen games, the US got tougher, nastier, feistier. They got into scuffles when they needed to assert their presence. They played their own game on their own terms. Call it Pochismo , a term floated in a recent press conference, to the affable Argentine’s delight. Or call it Poch-ball if you hate fun. Call it culture, which Pochettino has been talking about a lot in the last few days, and how it eats strategy for breakfast – an aphorism coined by management guru Peter Drucker, because modern soccer managers love few things as much as borrowing corporatese. It was fitting, then, that the introduction of Luna for Pulisic should coincide with the turning of the tide – without meaning to suggest that correlation is causation here. Luna has become a poster boy for Pochismo; A fiery sparkplug unafraid to take the game by the, well, let’s say scruff – although Pochettino might choose a different bit of anatomy in private. US and Australia players nearly came to blows on a few occasions. Photograph: Andrew Wevers/USSF/Getty Images In Wright and Roldan, erstwhile depth players stepped forward and will now make for uncomfortable crowding on the depth chart. That, too, was something Pochettino had hoped to see when he rotated six players out of his lineup after Friday’s 1-1 tie with Ecuador. “Players that can maybe tomorrow have the opportunity to perform and say, ‘Hey, be careful because I am knocking on the door and I can be there also in the World Cup ,’” the head coach said of the changes before the game. Suddenly, the Americans have gone from a dearth of productive strikers to a glut of them. Folarin Balogun has looked imperious in recent games, with the England-raised Monaco man looking like he could grow into the best striker this nation has had in at least a decade, if not several of them. Now, on the back of Haji Wright’s brace, there are options. “That is what we expect when we give the opportunity to the player,” Pochettino added afterwards. “That is good news.” Roldan, likewise, has elevated himself from the consummate glue guy to a man who might be cast for a leading role. Aside from his two assists on the night, Roldan was imperious in the middle of the park, often at the center of important plays on both sides of the ball. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how, if you want to build your perfect player, he has a little bit of everything.” Over the course of a team’s construction on the way to a World Cup, a loss can sometimes spark a kind of momentum. At the 2009 Confederations Cup, the US were hammered 3-1 by Italy and 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, yet stuck together and worked out how to mend themselves. The Yanks snuck into the semi-finals and beat a Spanish juggernaut to advance to the final, where they held a 2-0 lead over Brazil, before giving it away . That laid the foundation for a successful tournament in South Africa in 2010. During qualifying for the 2014 in edition, the Americans lost 2-1 in Honduras, whereupon a bombshell story in the Sporting News, wherein players tore into head coach Jürgen Klinsmann, threatened to derail their progress to Brazil. It didn’t. The Americans went on a long unbeaten run from there and then survived the group of death at the World Cup. This generation, meanwhile, suffered the shock of going through Concacaf World Cup qualifying for the first time in the late summer of 2021 with a scoreless tie in El Salvador, a home draw with Canada, and a half-time deficit in Honduras. Then, finally, they worked up the requisite intensity and unlocked a berth in Qatar without much more drama. A 2-0 loss to South Korea in New Jersey on 6 September might have been just such a moment for the current USMNT. The turnaround was already apparent in the second half, when the US changed formation and outplayed their opponents, even if the scoreboard remained unchanged. They beat Japan 2-0 three days later , relieving some pressure at last. Against Ecuador on Friday, the US looked sharp, organized and creative in the absence of Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Tyler Adams and, for most of the game, Pulisic. The Yanks matched South America’s second-best team in World Cup qualifying for a 1-1 tie. “After one year, I am so, so, so happy that we don’t talk about other things like commitment, attitude or things like this that normally in the past we were talking [about],” Pochettino proclaimed then. “I think that is a massive step up. It’s a thing that we need to forget and always win or lose depend[ing] on our performance. [If we don’t win], it’s a soccer problem and not another problem.” There have been a lot of those steps up for the US in the last six weeks. While Pochettino continues to take the long view, carefully managing minutes and niggling injuries, trying out players, formations, and pairings, his team is amassing a tangible momentum. “Progression is progression,” Pochettino said this week. “It’s difficult to measure. If you feel the progression, I think it’s good.” At long last, with just two camps remaining before the US assembles for a second World Cup on home turf in May, the Americans are feeling something.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/15/usmnt-world-cup-2026-australia-ecuador-friendlies,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0830ecac3d344b5e31b52be44bf5ab0f1a1b19d9/369_0_3688_2950/master/3688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e076876fc4eb145bb3a321c6689540f",2025-10-15T11:30:35+00:00,b14459323d74e9a8b847dd7720a2c665541a30fb
866dcf069f74,The peerless A’ja Wilson may already be the WNBA’s greatest ever player,,"A ’ja Wilson’s one-of-one season didn’t end merely with confetti so much as a deeper confirmation. When her Las Vegas Aces finished off a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury on Friday night to become only the second team in WNBA history to win three titles in a four-year span, the final horn felt less like a climax than a verdict: the best team of the era led by the best player of the era. When the dust settled the 29-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, had achieved a quadrafecta no player in the NBA or WNBA had ever managed: winning the scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year honors and MVP of the finals in the same year. Thanks to Wilson, a team who’d looked like the next great American sports dynasty before slipping from their perch a year ago was back at the mountaintop. But anyone who watched the front half of the season knows this was the least expected of Aces’ three banners. For most of the year Las Vegas didn’t give the appearance of a playoff team let alone a champion. They staggered through injuries and misfires, dropped coin-flip games and wore the tightness of a group playing beneath its standard. If dynasties are supposed to hum, this one coughed and sputtered. Quick Guide WNBA finals 2025 Show To understand how we got here, flash back to 2 August, when the Aces were boat-raced by 53 points by the Minnesota Lynx on national television, the worst loss in franchise history and the ultimate stress test of the culture Becky Hammon has spent four seasons building. Las Vegas were a moribund 14–14 then, six weeks from the finish line and barely in the postseason frame. Wilson walked out of Michelob Ultra Arena replaying the wreckage, drafting and redrafting a message she knew had to cut through without burning down what morale remained. She workshopped it with her partner Bam Adebayo, the two-time Olympic gold medallist and Miami Heat captain and then hit send to the team chat: If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing. The next day, Vegas routed Golden State and never lost again in the regular season, ripping off 16 straight wins to nail down the No 2 seed while Wilson sprinted past history to a record fourth MVP trophy . Hammon matched the tone with a structural tweak that mattered: players would build and present their own scouting reports before coaches weighed in. Accountability stopped being a slogan and became the operating system. “A’ja comes in with a laptop,” Hammon told ESPN. “They’ll kick the coaches out and do their thing.” Only then does the image that will live on come into focus – two nights before the sweep, before a sold-out Phoenix crowd of 17,071 at full boil – Wilson rising, spinning and feathering home an eight-footer with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3 as DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas crowded her airspace. That shot – thought to be the first buzzer-beater over a married couple in basketball history – didn’t just win a game. It effectively sealed the Aces’ place in WNBA lore. The sweep will be the headline, but the spine of this title is that midseason decision to choose standards over excuses. It carried through an edgy playoff run that tried to jar them loose: Seattle forced a decisive Game 3 that needed Jackie Young’s late put-back ; Indiana dragged them into an overtime Game 5 that would have cracked lesser champions. “There were a lot of doubts besides in that locker room,” Aces point guard Chelsea Gray said. “We stayed the course and trusted the process the entire time.” Las Vegas Aces And always, there was Wilson: shrinking options at the rim and expanding them at the elbow, the league’s most terrifying deterrent and its cleanest late-clock answer in the same body. There’s a special joy in watching her go about her work. If her Game 3 winner was the cinematic flourish, her Game 4 closeout was the masterclass in control when the jumpers weren’t falling. On a night where she missed 14 of her 21 attempts from the floor, Wilson changed the terms instead – owning the glass, spiking shots, jumping passing lanes, making a home at the stripe and going 17-for-19 there. Possession by possession, she bent the game back to her will. This year pushes past tidy résumé-building and into something rarer. Wilson wasn’t just the best player in this series; she was the best player in the sport, shouldering into a GOAT conversation that has long begun with Cheryl Miller’s legend and Maya Moore’s incandescent peak. She bears the weight lightly, which is part of the spell. The tambourine bit at the podium during the post-game presser – equal parts Baptist church joke and credo on patience and faith – landed because it sounded like her: unguarded, joyful, before quietly matter-of-fact and clear-eyed in expounding on the work it takes to win. A’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces, left, celebrates in front of Satou Sabally of the Phoenix Mercury after making a basket during Game 2 of the WNBA finals. Photograph: Ian Maule/Getty Images Asked to redefine greatness now that she’s stacking championships at a historic clip, Wilson widened the lens. “Obviously I would still [say] banners, but I think greatness is … it’s who you’re around. This is greatness. This group here, we were battle-tested, top to bottom battle-tested. We showed up every single day with a mind of being great,” she said in Friday’s aftermath. “You’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right.” Hammon’s appraisal supplied a blunt epigraph to the season: you can debate basketball’s Mount Rushmore if you want, but Wilson is “alone on Everest”. That sounds like flattery until you try to explain Wilson’s 2025 without resorting to the obvious truth that she controlled both ends of the court more completely than any of her peers. The Aces’ stars toggled roles without complaint – Young from flamethrower to rebounding guard; Gray from closer to organizer; free-agent addition Jewell Loyd (now 10-0 in WNBA finals games , by the way) from gunner to grit – and the bench minutes that once felt like a liability turned into leverage thanks to Dana Evans and company. But it all orbited the same gravitational pull of their 6ft 4in talisman. The closer a series got to wobble-time, the calmer Wilson seemed to breathe. Where it goes from here is business as much as basketball. Much of the WNBA’s workforce, including key Aces, approach free agency as the deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement ticks louder. That uncertainty hovered even as the confetti fell. It also hovered over a fortnight of renewed friction between the league office and locker rooms. Reports of comments attributed to commissioner Cathy Engelbert about players being “on their knees” in gratitude – which the Englebert has partially disputed – landed like a cymbal crash against the reality on the floor: the players are the product. The Mortgage Matchup Center crowd underscored that point with a cacophony of boos during Englebert’s trophy presentation, while Gray did it from the dais. “When you have great players, you need to treat them like that. That’s payment. That’s treatment. That’s revenue share,” she said. “There’s no league without the players.” In the end, two scenes bookend the truth of this season: an August text on the night of a 53-point embarrassment, and an October fadeaway that hushed a cauldron in the desert. The improbable midseason swerve into inevitability – the choice to recommit, then the refusal to blink – turned both into canon. The Aces rediscovered their standard at rock bottom and rode it back to the summit. Perhaps the verdict, delivered by the player who just authored a season like no other, was in from the start.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/aja-wilson-goat-aces-sweep-wnba-finals-quadruple-crown,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fa9451396fab27286bbc04971c9134a9fa3c69/407_0_4068_3255/master/4068.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5877386f3d7adce7ce849b3da4bb2d46",2025-10-11T17:33:55+00:00,4ea2a4ca67a63fb95c2bba97f39a9d283a59f80c
44791c2eccff,Flag alert! Gary Neville may not be Orwell but he is a very English type of patriot,,"“A t the far end of the food counter a group of men were pledging allegiance to the flag, with trays balanced in one hand, in order to be allowed to take seats at the table. A group that had arrived earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there.” Welcome to our own Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, another real-time demonstration of the fact every satirical absurdity described in Catch-22 has become, yeah, pretty much totally plausible. The nation is now fully hostage to bad actors and phoney rage. And as ever football must act as a key amplifier of all this, a public echo chamber for the anxieties of what we must, out of a sense of duty, still call the real world. It took eight minutes for the crowd at Wembley on Thursday night to demonstrate that they have finally moved on from chanting Keir Starmer is a wanker. Instead they chanted Gary Neville is a wanker. Two days earlier Joey Barton, who exists in the public consciousness solely because of football, published a video to his 2.7 million X followers in which he said he would punch a disabled person in a wheelchair if they suggested a union flag should not be flown over a building site. To be fair, this does seem an unlikely scenario. Perhaps there could be an interim stage where the two of them try to have a chat about it first. But no. Joey would rather cut straight to the real business of violently vetting disabled people for patriotism, out there furiously overturning wheelchairs like Indiana Jones weaving through the souk looking for Marion inside a laundry basket. Sometimes, you just get the heroes you need. Here are two pretty sound ideas. First, if anyone ever asks you to take a flag seriously, they’re immediately to be distrusted. A flag is just some colours. A flag has no inherent fixed meaning. Flags are groupthink, a suspension of independent thought. The civil rights movement wasn’t defined by a flag. The fall of the Berlin Wall didn’t have a flag. The peace movement didn’t have a flag, just flowers, hair and chauvinistic sex. And second, there are few things more un-English than brandishing the flag like a weapon. For this reason alone I am proud of Gary Neville for speaking up this week about flags , for trying to make the point that it is un-patriotically un-English to go around insisting on English patriotism. The reaction to Gary Neville’s video message about flags and patriotism shows he was on to something, even if he did not articulate it well. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian Neville is of course an easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy. He can be a doofus and a chop, the hammer of Qatar who will also work for the state broadcaster at Qatar’s propaganda World Cup, a Lineker-level degree of cognitive dissonance. And yes, in his speech Neville rambled widely, exposing the contradictions of pretty much every fixed position you may choose to take right now. He should also have condemned acts of Islamic terrorism, something people on the left often seem unable to do. He shouldn’t have focused solely on “angry white middle-aged men” in the wake of a double murder at a synagogue. It is also a ducking of what he seemed to want to say. Which was to talk specifically about Nigel Farage , who does need to be challenged openly, who is a deeply cynical threat to the public discourse, a campy and theatrical nihilist posing as a Real Person, who uses fear and division to manipulate people into voting for him. But I am still proud of Neville for speaking up. It is good that a sportsperson is addressing this, an actual issue in his hometown, and doing so with genuine feeling, unafraid of the violent reaction that will follow. This is his parish. He is an angry middle-aged white man, and has spent a lot of time around flags. For all his easily gotcha-contradictions Neville feels it, is well-intentioned and is worth a million Farages. And while it is easy to say Stick To Sport VAR-boy, the reality is this has everything to do with sport, a place that has been aggressively flag-draped and militarised, where even a radio interview in midweek with the deeply mild Chris Woakes ended with the phrase “Thank you for your service” as though Woakes has been out there killing the Taliban for the last 10 years. Above all the reaction to Neville’s video message proved he was on to something. Before long a Traitor Scum banner had appeared outside Old Trafford. On the internet Neville was pilloried over old video clips of him not singing God Save the Queen, a genuine moment of salt and pepper flag-pledge madness. The Daily Telegraph has had a permanent hate-erection for the last four days, and can only be a small step away from giving away Gary Neville wicker dolls for your children to burn with its weekend editions. Rumour has it four leader writers have already been hospitalised by rage. Most tellingly the same paper published a response from Farage that suggested Neville should be fired by his private sector employer for not wanting to fly a flag, an idea so absurd, so unpatriotic, so wilfully ignorant, it seems impossible nobody inside this mighty engine of English free speech didn’t feel uneasy about projecting it as a serious political message. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the messaging is getting dangerous. He said Brexit has had a terrible effect (see: the steel industry). He said we shouldn’t be pulled right and left. He said we must stop promoting abusive hate speech. He said he had ordered one of his building sites to take down a union flag because they had never previously flown one, and, like, it’s also just a building site. The best thing he said was that “the union flag being used in a negative fashion is not right”, something that is, intentionally or not, very George Orwell in its understanding of patriotism. Orwell gets marched around the place in a headlock all the time these days, dragged randomly into every debate. But he knew about symbols and flags and about Englishness and its values. Flags are prevalent at sporting events these days, but George Orwell said that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging was a key ingredient of English resilience and character. Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images In The Lion and the Unicorn, a love letter in support of the war against German fascism, he writes that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging is a key ingredient of English resilience and character. He speaks with pride and affection of the fact “the working man’s heart does not leap when he sees a union jack”, that “the patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious”, and that England is above all a compromise, “a strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency”. Neville is groping for something similar, the fact the best kind of freedom is the freedom not to give two hoots about a square of fabric, or browbeating notions of patriotism. Pointedly, Orwell also preaches vigilance, the need to let your heritage grow and change, that England “has to be true to herself”, and that “she is not being true to herself while the refugees who have come to our shores are penned up in concentration camps”. Famously Orwell also hated sport because of its weaponising of nationalism, its glorification of physical victory, and has been proved right in this now more than ever before. England football didn’t traditionally have flags in it right through to the 1980s, when they would occasionally appear daubed with National Front slogans. Right now the last two hosts of the men’s World Cup, and also the next one, are involved in a bloody conflict of some kind. Orwell was half right. Sport is now war plus the shooting. There are two last things worth saying. Neville may be correct in his sense of a more nuanced idea of traditional English patriotism. But he is also out of time. The hive mind, shout-politics, algorithm life have trampled over lots of things. The idea that the best kind of Englishness can stay separate from this seems out of date. Britain itself is more than ever like a strange, small, damp archipelago marooned at the jumping-off point between the continents. On the other hand, it doesn’t mean this is fixed either. In Catch-22, The Great Loyalty Oath Crusade comes to an end when the largely silent Major de Coverley walks into the mess hall, scowls at the absurdity of flag-hugging and anthem-singing, and says three words: “Give Everybody Eat.” At which point the whole thing evaporates in its own absurdity. Someone has to say something, and keep saying it, however garbled or easily shot down. Neville may not be our George Orwell. But he is, for all his contradictions, a very English type of patriot.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/flag-alert-gary-neville-orwell-english-patriot,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710820eab1dea72882078c2470a44d86d17fa537/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b86bb9b85b321538524a9077c157531",2025-10-10T16:50:22+00:00,35309279e8e07ab0adc75a9f0914526d8bab1d2c
754a722ae319,All fluffed up: why modern balls are sparking injury worries and frustration in tennis,,"I t did not take Daniil Medvedev long to realise he was in serious trouble at the French Open. As he tried to find a way past Britain’s Cameron Norrie in the first round, the Russian simply did not feel comfortable striking the ball. With his prospects of advancing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world dwindling, the 29-year-old settled on a drastic solution. Medvedev requested completely different strings when he sent his rackets to be restrung mid-match, switching from a hybrid of natural gut and polyester strings to a full polyester setup. It is normal for players to alter their string tension during a match, but few would consider a change as dramatic as the actual string type. Medvedev has now made the switch many times this year: “Until 2023 I had never done it,” Medvedev says. “Something started to change on tour, I had to adapt. Now I’m never sure.” The world No 18 is referring to the properties of the tennis balls on tour and how slight changes in recent years have left him uncertain how to optimise his game. The quality of balls across the tour has been one of the most significant talking points and sources of frustration among players around the world. “That’s probably the biggest difference I can notice, compared to maybe 10, 15 years ago,” Novak Djokovic says. “It’s the balls.” One of many significant challenges in elite tennis is adjusting to the differing conditions each week, including the constantly changing balls. Different tournaments have their own contracts with ball manufacturers, which present other issues. Injuries are often attributed to players having to adjust to different types of balls. There is a growing consensus that many different balls decay at a faster rate than ever before, which Emma Raducanu describes as difficult to navigate and another injury hazard: “I do think the balls are a big challenge for all of us,” says Raducanu. “The way that they deteriorate is really challenging. I think it gets very fluffy. You see a lot of wrist, elbow, shoulder injuries happening now. And it is hard because the dynamic of the points can be different from when they’re new to when they’re old.” New tennis balls are encased in a tight layer of felt but, as they make contact with the racket strings and court surface, it fluffs up, making them less aerodynamic. They travel through the air more slowly, meaning it is harder to hit winners as fluffier balls lead to more prolonged rallies. Many players believe they fluff up more quickly today. At least some of these issues can be attributed to production line problems in factories during the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the consistency and quality of the felt provided by the suppliers to the tennis ball manufacturing companies. Daniil Medvedev says since 2023 he is ‘never sure’ about how tennis balls will behave during a match. Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty Images As players try to adjust, the sport itself is changing. Less powerful players such as Norrie now believe it is even more difficult to impose their game with some balls. “I think that the ball’s getting messed up easier in some tournaments,” he says. “For players like me and Daniil, it’s not easy to generate as much power as other players, and that’s cost me, or it’s easier for other players. But, to be honest, I’m never complaining about the balls.” Those who generate significant amounts of topspin have also felt the differences. A livelier ball accentuates the effects of heavy topspin, allowing the ball to bounce higher and rise further outside the opponent’s strike zone. Casper Ruud, who possesses one of the game’s most spin-heavy forehands, believes his strokes are less potent due to the balls: “I feel like the players are handling my heavy shots like way better now than when I came on tour, which was pre-Covid, and they’re able to just step in and rip the damn thing back and I’m kind of surprised how well people do it.” Many players have addressed their issues with the balls by incorporating natural gut strings in their rackets alongside polyester strings, which helps to generate more power. Others shift to a looser string tension when they feel they are struggling to generate pace with certain balls. As is often the case in tennis, however, a disadvantage for one player is another player’s asset. None of this has stopped Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner from dominating the sport this year. Both possess such destructive weapons that they can still generate massive speed off slower balls. Nobody has been more outspoken on this subject than Medvedev. Two and a half years after holding the No 1 ranking, he is trying to find a way through one of the most difficult periods of his career. The Russian, who has achieved one of his best results of the year this week by reaching the Shanghai Masters semi-finals, now sits at No 18 in the ATP rankings and he frequently describes the balls as his biggest obstacle. Medvedev says he does not want to be known as the player “crying” after every match, but says he is just being honest: “Some players will like this ball, so I get it,” he says. “I’m crying because it disadvantages me. But if you take six balls out of the new balls out of the can, if you look closely and you bounce them, there are going to be six different balls. I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to be.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/10/all-fluffed-up-why-modern-balls-are-causing-frustration-and-injury-in-tennis,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba67e8566ffe2e5c1982f8b7ad23aee77865ac5/420_0_3560_2848/master/3560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec2c9a08be9682d2525a1a9055954892",2025-10-10T14:02:39+00:00,41718dd68482da995eb8e75db308add2a0e83a08
a5325f5a529c,"Team Europe and Red Roses use connection to past, present and future to create history",,"M aking history is such an overused phrase in sport. There’s a danger we start to believe it’s easy, expected, nothing special. Or that it just happens by magic in an instant on a golf green or a rugby pitch. We envisage “Henry V speeches” on the eve of battle urging players to make their mark on history moments before stepping into the arena. But at the weekend, two of the finest sports teams in the world demonstrated how months and years of intentional, deep culture-building are necessary to create a team identity to underpin the highest levels of performance. Although at starkly different ends of the commercial sports world, both the European Ryder Cup team and the England women’s rugby team deliberately cultivated a shared sense of what it meant for each team to create history together. Europe knew they had to defy the odds to win away for the first time since 2012 , while the Red Roses hadn’t won the World Cup since 2014, losing in the previous two finals. So what did these teams draw on to ensure they could bring their best game in those make or break moments? Performing under pressure at that level is not about training harder or putting the game‑face on. It’s not enough to be fuelled purely by individual, extrinsic drivers “to be the best”. That’s always there within an athlete’s psyche, but when you need to dig really deep – whether it’s facing a hostile environment at Bethpage Black, or Canada scoring first against you in the World Cup final at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. You need deep-rooted foundations to ground you, to hold your nerve and find your best performance, and to develop the instincts that help a team to achieve more together than they could alone. Rather than feel negatively pressured or weighed down by history as we have seen in the past, these athletes, captains, vice-captains and coaches respected, researched and embraced the history of their sports. They understood how the past, present and future would connect when they took to the field of play. And then they used this understanding to make sense of their unique responsibility to write the next chapter together, finding joy in the opportunity and privilege to do so. Behind the scenes in the Europe locker room, “This is our time, this is our place” was emblazoned on the wall, accompanied by names, jerseys and stories of those who had made their mark, focusing on the European Ryder Cup teams that had beaten the odds to win in the US. The dates of the four previous wins were written on the walls: 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2012 with the four shirts of those winning away teams hanging up. This wasn’t just about words, it was about jerseys worn and sweated in by their predecessors. Their shared challenge was to add one more shirt to the rail. A similarly profound history swirled around the Red Roses. The Trail of Roses installation at the London Eye celebrated every woman who had pulled on an England shirt, the pioneers and trailblazers on whose shoulders the current team knew they stood. This was a moment to show how far the women’s game had come since the first World Cup in 1991 and point to the immense future potential. Echoing the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team philosophy of taking care of the jersey before passing it on in better shape to the next player, these supremely talented golfers and rugby players drew on this sense of lineage to reach out and connect with their audiences. All the while, they gained perspective, meaning and humility for themselves, qualities that are key components of human resilience.

Luke Donald, the European captain, reaffirmed that they weren’t just playing to win, they were playing for each other, for all those who dreamed of playing for Europe in the future, for something far greater than themselves. Continuing to draw on the work with the performance coach Owen Eastwood that shaped his captaincy and team-building skills two years ago in Rome, Donald commissioned a moving video that featured many of the 37 European men who had won an away Ryder Cup, including current members of the team and himself – a powerful reinforcement of their overarching mission. Donald knew he needed to invest in both the data and the culture, the quantitative and the qualitative. One vice-captain, Edoardo Molinari, crunched the stats to inform pairings while another, José María Olazábal, captain from the last Europe team to win on foreign soil, brought past inspiration. Donald spent time listening to the players, figuring out how to prepare and set them up to thrive and play their best game at Bethpage Black: creating a shared purpose, connecting them to each other and then giving them autonomy to lead themselves once on the course. New Zealander John Mitchell, the Red Roses’ head coach, similarly prioritised culture-building since joining in 2023. The Red Roses emulated one of the core team strengths of England’s women footballers by ensuring the team spirit for those among the replacements felt as strong as those on the pitch. They also shared the Lionesses’ ambition to create a lasting positive impact after the tournament through inspiring younger girls watching, the upcoming generation of players, as well as global rugby leaders to see the future potential of the sport. Both of these glorious sports teams have shown us that the true value of their sporting success lies in the depth of connection to their predecessors, those watching now and future generations to come. Developing a deep and deliberate historical consciousness is becoming a core part of how modern elite sports teams build resilient cultures to take their performance to the next level.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/01/team-europe-red-roses-use-connection-past-present-future-history-together-womens-rugby-union-ryder-cup-golf,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb5d76fc05d341c5c22977c61400072f17c1cf0/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f56d7e2ca51ad36d3015f7b5ca31f6a9",2025-10-01T07:00:06+00:00,0d5679609157ed4b62ebc056c9226d7d53a4e17f

755ea8bdf291,Clive Tyldesley: ‘I’ve only been drunk twice and once was with the England women’s team’,,"What is the best sporting accomplishment or achievement you have commentated on and did you ever harbour personal ambitions to be a professional in any sport? Tony Medlock I was never good enough at any sport to kid myself that I had a career at elite level. My parents would have told you that from an early age any sporting ambitions I entertained were in the area I ended up in; describing and commentating on top-level sport. I always resist any grading of goals or players or matches because I have a belief that sport belongs in its moment. Sport creates memories – we can recall vividly where we were, who we were with, what we were thinking, when our team won a trophy or an athlete won an Olympic gold medal … or Shane Lowry sunk a putt to seal the Ryder Cup . Those moments are very personal, and the job of the commentator is to try to add something to the memory of those moments. And those moments are unique and should remain separate from one another. My favourite line of commentary of yours is from the final whistle of the 1992 Second Division play off final between my beloved Blackburn Rovers and Leicester: “That’s it! Going up, going up, going up! Blackburn Rovers have made it at last, and the great Ewood gamble by Jack Walker on Kenny Dalglish has paid out the premier prize!” Did you have this or any of your other famous lines scripted, or is it all down to the moment? Dave Stainton Preparation for a commentary is partly about researching information; in the modern era that includes statistics and data. But more importantly, preparation is a journalistic process, asking yourself: “What’s the story here?” “What does it mean for Blackburn Rovers to win this match or for Leicester City to win this match?” In cup finals the commentator gets extra air time after the final whistle – during the celebrations, during the presentation of the trophy – to reflect on what they have seen, and in preparation for that I often draw up a sheet which will have, in this case, Blackburn down one side and Leicester down the other … you can’t script lines because you don’t know what the story of the game is going to be, but you can write bullet points which highlight the significance of victory or the repercussions of defeat for the two teams involved. That’s a useful reference point in those very emotional moments after a game such a playoff final. It’s then a case of finding the right words to fit the moment, and that can really only be done in the moment. After “And Solskj ær has won it!” did you think : “Shit, I hope Bayern don’t score now”? David Estherby That’s a very good question, actually, because in saying what I said I broke the cardinal rule of commentary, the Devon Loch rule: never wave the winner across the winning line until they’re there. And if Bayern [Munich] had gone down the other end and equalised and the game went to penalties, they would have definitely won the shootout, and then there probably would have been an effigy of me hanging on a lamp-post at the Arndale Centre by midnight. I would have been blamed for Manchester United not winning the final. When I recall that game there was a definite change in momentum when the equaliser went in; it was as if the Bayern players and fans had witnessed some sort of awful human tragedy. There was a disbelief that it was difficult for them to recover from. And therefore, when Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] reached out and diverted the ball into the roof of the net, the heart overruled the head and I said what I felt : “That’s it, that’s the winning goal.” Do you have any spare copies of the end-of-season compilation cassette you did for Radio City commemorating Liverpool’s double-winning side? My mum chucked mine out by accident (so she says). Stephen Carr Sounds like you lost it yourself! I do have a box of memorabilia but I’m pretty sure a copy of that cassette is not in it. Apologies Stephen, can’t help with that one, sadly. What is your favourite ground to commentate at and why? Adam There are certain stadiums that create an atmosphere of their own; you wouldn’t be surprised to hear me say Anfield or Celtic Park on a Champions League night. But for the commentator that’s no good if you can’t see the pitch properly. And so in terms of favourite places to broadcast from I tend to make my selection based on the height and access of the commentary position. Some of them are a long way away from the pitch, some of them are too close to the pitch … some of them are too low, some of them are too high. For many years the commentary position at Goodison Park involved walking past the roof of the Bullens Road Stand and then shinnying down a vertical ladder, none of which is preferable in preparation for a football match! At modern stadiums, like the Emirates and the Etihad, you are provided with a commentary position that is at a perfect height. Also, I was fortunate enough to commentate on a couple of Cup finals in the Cardiff era, when Wembley was being renovated, and I always felt the commentary position there [the Millennium Stadium] was what I would call a “no-excuses commentary position”. ‘And Solskjær has won it!’ Manchester United seal the 1999 Treble and provide Clive Tyldesley with the platform to well and truly shine. Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock Has there ever been a moment in a match you’ve been commentating on that has left you speechless? Daniel Richardson I always struggle with this question because in my job I’m always trying very hard not to be speechless. I’ve got professional standards and hate it if I make an error, and getting lost for words would very much be an error. My great mentor Reg Gutteridge used to say: “Silent moments are not lesser moments; instead they are times during a television commentary when you don’t need to add anything and instead ask yourself what could you add next.” So silences are part of good commentary. How do you feel about where the style of modern-day commentary is heading? Rob The trend in contemporary sports media is towards conversation. We’ve seen the rise of the podcast and before that the rise of the phone-in. Even the main rights holders for live sport embroider their coverage with long discussions and debates. It’s the way we’ve consumed sport in classroom and barroom arguments and in recent times those arguments have become content and created stars, people who are genuine influencers and influence the way people consume sport. So there was an inevitability of that trend spilling into commentary; it’s become more conversational, which has been reflected in recent years with the rise of more than two people commentating on live football and other sporting events. The first priority of a commentator is to consider your audience and who your audience are. The audience for, say, a World Cup semi-final on terrestrial television is different to that for a Conference League game on TNT Sport. You need to commentate to your audience, and the danger when you have more than two people working on a live commentary is that they start talking to each other rather than to the audience. And, as the audience, you feel as if you’re eavesdropping into a conversation. That doesn’t serve an audience because it doesn’t engage and include them. “Not for me, Clive .” How many times a day do you hear that phrase? Mike Cotton A lot! It’s a phrase Andy Townsend first used regularly and [Ally] McCoist has taken to a different level! In all seriousness … the relationship between a commentator and a co-commentator is traditionally, and essentially, a trained broadcaster who can recognise the players and the drama and someone who has gone across the white line and can provide an informed, professional opinion on what we’ve just seen. I always bow to the experience of a co-commentator, and so if I said something and Andy looked at me and said “Not for me, Clive”, I fully took it on board. And ultimately it was a really good friend in a really gentle and sympathetic way saying: “Shut up! What do you know?!” If I was having one of those dream supper parties that people are often asked to put together, Andy and Ally would definitely be there. Both are great pals and wonderful co-commentators to work with, on and off the mic. Clive Tyldesley on commentary duty alongside his longtime co-commentator and friend Andy Townsend. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Are there any teams you were fond of commentating on who did not win the Champions League during your time covering the tournament for ITV? Eddie Munro As a kid I was fond of Manchester United; I’m from Bury, my dad took me to Old Trafford when I was five and throughout my youth there was only one team in the world for me. But when I started to work that feeling became diluted by the fact I was commentating on my mates; my friends were out there, people I had met through football. It’s a different feeling when you’re commentating on people who you know. In regards to that period, from basically 1999 through the noughties, Premier League clubs were among the regular contenders to win the Champions League and I guess it would have been nice to see Arsenal get over the line. I had no affinity with the club but I always had a huge amount of respect for Arsène Wenger; he was never dismissive of any inquiries, he always tried to be helpful, and that team during that era, with the likes of [Thierry] Henry, [Robert] Pires, [Dennis] Bergkamp, were certainly good enough to win a Champions League final, and in Paris [in 2006] they very nearly did . Did you ever imagine in early 1972, when you opened the door to Room 7 at Kirkham Grammar School, where we were having an English lesson with Mick Clarkson, and announced “Preston are playing Man United” after listening to the FA Cup draw on your radio, that you would one day commentate on all those big matches for ITV and BBC? Philip Smith As previously touched on, I entertained ambitions of being a commentator from an early age; I wasn’t the only kid who chased a football around the park and commentated to himself, but I meant it. I wanted to do that. It was my one and only ambition. English was my favourite school subject; I was that kid who loved to write essays and poetry, and wrote the match reports for the school magazine. So English teachers were a big part of my school life and I can remember two or three who had a big influence on me. Mick Clarkson was certainly one of those. He died this year and I was fortunate to have some contact with him, after years and years and years with no contact, before he passed away. That was lovely. Clive Tyldesley is supporting the Football Association’s Silent Support Weekend. ‘It’s an initiative to promote true support and encouragement. Stop moaning, start cheering!’ Photograph: Alex Broadway/The FA/Getty Images How do you reflect on being an early supporter of England’s women’s team? I remember you being in Sweden for the 1995 World Cup, alongside Hazel Irvine (I was England’s ­press officer). Mark Sudbury I’ve only been truly drunk twice in my adult life and once was with the England women’s football team in Sweden in 1995. It was after they lost [to Germany] in the quarter-finals, I was staying in the same hotel as the team and thought I could drink the likes of Clare Taylor and Kaz [Karen] Walker under the table; I was wrong! Nobody who follows women’s football needs telling the game had a very different profile in 1995 than it does in 2025 and some of the pioneers of the success England have enjoyed in recent years were in that team. So I look back fondly at being there, especially as it’s the only women’s football I have ever covered. Are you still a big fan of Joni Mitchell? If I’m not mistaken, you once called her “the first lady of rock ”. Peter Walker ­I’ve got pretty eclectic musical tastes; I like a bit of everything and make a point of listening to contemporary music, and more than anything I’m in awe of anybody who can write words that take my breath away. Make me think. Make me cry. Joni Mitchell certainly had that ability, she was one of the truly great songwriters of my youth. More than anything I admired how she could – can – take men apart in two lines. She knows us much better than we know ourselves.

dd18792ad22d,Curtain up for epic rugby tale Exe Men: the best south-west drama since Poldark,,"L adies and gentlemen, it’s almost time to take your seats. The most compelling West Country drama since Poldark? Friday Night Lights with pasties? Or, if you like, a little dash of Scrumpy & Western? Never let it be said we lack creative enthusiasm out here in the sticks, nor the desire to offer local theatregoers something refreshingly different. Welcome, either way, to the world’s most improbable new stage play. How else to summarise a production about the rise of an unflashy Devon rugby club, based on the book Exe Men by – there’s no easy way to say this – yours truly. Trust me, watching professional actors rehearse scenes that started life on your own keyboard is a surreal experience. Fortunately Exe Men the play – which opens next week – has been written by someone with significantly better credentials. Remember the BBC’s brilliant Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes? Detective Gene Hunt firing up the Quattro ? The show’s co-creator Ashley Pharoah has specialised in TV screenwriting but also loves his rugby and was instantly intrigued when Martin Berry, creative director at Exeter’s Northcott Theatre , approached him. It was brave of them because rugby – with wonderful exceptions such as Up ’n’ Under, Stand Up And Fight, and Grav – can be a tricky theatrical theme. How do you improve, dramatically speaking, on Exeter going from lower-league anonymity to the champions of Europe in little over a decade? Particularly if everyone knows the ending? Or if some people watching don’t really like sport? The aim, accordingly, has been to highlight the characters who made it happen and the intense regional pride they aroused. And how each can shape the other. Ashley, Martin and myself also share the same conviction: that the south-west deserves a higher national profile. Actor Tim Hudson (left) and the man he plays, Tony Rowe, chair of Exeter Chiefs, during rehearsals for the play Exe Men. Photograph: Samuel Simpson-Pattison/Rugby Journal “When was the last time you heard a national newsreader with a West Country accent?” asks Berry rhetorically. If the peninsula does make the news it’s usually because something unpleasant has washed up on a beach or the weather has scared the tourists away. The lack of Premier League football south-west of Bristol has traditionally been another factor. Which is why it caused a stir when the Chiefs were promoted to English rugby’s top division in 2010. Devon has produced plenty of yachtsmen, swimmers and the occasional Tom Daley but, aside from a few FA Cup victories for Plymouth Argyle , not much sustained team sporting success. Little did anyone guess that, by October 2020, the Chiefs would be claiming a domestic and European trophy double – a feat that even Pharoah, as a Bath fan, found extraordinary. “To go from sidestepping dog poo in a public park to winning the European Cup is amazing. It’s a bigger story, in some ways, than Leicester winning the Premier League when you think of where they came from.” The book sought to tell that epic tale through its central pillars. Men such as Rob Baxter who, along with his brother Richie, followed their farmer father John into the “other” family enterprise at the muddy old County Ground. Or the club’s chair, Tony Rowe, whose business nous helped to rescue the club financially. Or Gareth Steenson, the fly‑half previously rejected by his native Ulster. “We were all told we weren’t good enough somewhere else,” Steenson says. “The strength of the group at the start was that we were from all over the place so we got to know each other’s families.” Exeter Chiefs lift the trophy after claiming the European Champions Cup in 2020. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters While slightly disappointed that Jamie Dornan will not be portraying him – “He would have been perfect” – “Steeno” is now looking forward to seeing how the Chiefs’ once lively post-match “rehydration” sessions are depicted. “Sitting on the bus home for three hours gave us time to socialise. I could barely tell you what happened in a lot of games but what I remember most are the social times. I remember we got our first losing bonus point away from home, at Northampton, and celebrating like we’d won with a bonus point.” All the above, plus the chocolate muffin‑loving Kiwi Thomas Waldrom, England’s Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, and Ireland’s Ian Whitten are played engagingly by six professional actors and a 31‑strong community ensemble. skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s actually a lot you can do to take the audience with you. If we just ask them to sit and watch some footage then we’ve cocked it up.” Cometh the hour, then, for Robert Shaw Cameron, who plays the club’s big chief, Rob Baxter. The former was the dentist Laurence Reeves in Coronation Street but now has a role into which he can properly sink his teeth. “It’s the first time I’ve played a ‘real’ person and you do feel a deep responsibility. There’s a public version of Rob and Tony but there’s a private version as well. The challenge was accessing that private bit. I wanted to explore what people don’t see. When I asked Rob whether he has a confidant he talked about his wife, Jo. That’s something we’ve worked hard to reflect.” Pharoah has also sought to tease out the human emotions of other pivotal individuals. “It’s about sport but it’s not really. It’s about people and dreams.” And, when you dig slightly deeper, about male fellowship, too. “One of the elements is that men aren’t completely crap and can achieve things. I really like that about it. It’s a play about maleness which isn’t necessarily the most fashionable thing to write about at the moment, is it?” A few of those portrayed may not instantly recognise themselves but in Rowe’s case it is very much the opposite. Tim Hudson, the actor playing him, arguably looks more like Rowe than the chair does himself. “It is quite strange,” says Rowe, now 77 but still bound for South America this week to drive a rally car through Brazil and Guyana. “When the people who know me see him they’ll say: ‘There’s Tony.’” So brace yourselves. The south‑west – and rugby – is about to enjoy a rare stage closeup. As Cameron puts it: “In this golden age of telly and Netflix, this is what theatre can still do better than anything else: tell stories that resonate with people and speak to their community.” Will anyone “do an Exeter” again? Probably not.

3d6dd8f84426,Jos Buttler: ‘A big burden has been lifted – I wasn’t the same leader after the 2023 World Cup’,,"A nother summer is over and, for Jos Buttler, life and cricket feel more precious than ever. The fleeting nature of both has been accentuated by the loss of Buttler’s father, John, after his unexpected death in August. The 35-year-old will soon talk movingly about grief and acceptance but, first, he reflects on his venerable place in white-ball cricket after England’s international summer ended in a low-key series in Ireland . Buttler opened the batting and Jacob Bethell and Rehan Ahmed, who followed him at three and four in the opening match, are both 21. But he had proved his sustained brilliance a few weeks earlier when, against South Africa, he hit 83 off 30 balls in a blistering knock that helped England to become the first team to pass 300 in a T20 international . “They were affectionately calling me Grandpa,” Buttler says of his teammates in Ireland. “It was just me and [the 37-year-old] Adil Rashid as the older crew but it’s still great even if sometimes I’m thinking: ‘God, how lucky you guys are to have all this ahead of you.’ But I’ve made a conscious effort to try not to think about my age. I’m going to play cricket like this as long as I can and just enjoy it.” We’re in a London studio, soon after Buttler and Stuart Broad finished recording this week’s episode of their successful For the Love of Cricket podcast . I’m in the chair where Rob Key, the managing director of the England cricket team, had sat while Broad and Buttler interviewed him. But Buttler slips seamlessly into the role of interviewee as he talks honestly about his emotions. Jos Buttler looks to the skies after reaching 50 against South Africa at Old Trafford this month. Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/Shutterstock “I got out for a duck in my last innings [in Dublin] and I was absolutely gutted,” he says. “But as long as I’m getting annoyed when I don’t do well, I’ve still got that edge.” Does he still have “fuck it” written on the top of his bat handle? “I do. At the non-striker’s end I look at it as it’s a nice reminder about what matters to me.” On his podcast Buttler spoke about how this year he had dug out his old notebooks where he used to write down his cricketing thoughts. “In the last six months I’ve stopped doing that. As a [white‑ball] captain I had some good days and a few more bad days and I was especially knocked after the 50-over World Cup in India [when England were hapless in 2023 ]. I took those old books to India to the IPL [in March] and read through them. I found very similar themes throughout the last 10 years. Every time I play, I find myself looking at the sky and imagining him looking down Jos Buttler on his father If I was playing great I was writing the same thing – just like when I was playing badly. “It made me think I’ve got to stop trying so hard. I had a great IPL, played as well as I’ve ever played, and I was like: ‘Wow, I can play well without writing my notes, without saying I need to do X, Y, Z.’” Buttler takes another mouthful of sushi and chews thoughtfully. “It all comes full circle and, in the latter part of my career, I want to enjoy it and not hang on to things as hard as I may have done.” A brutal test of this philosophy came less than two months ago when his dad died. “It happened during the Hundred and it was quite raw. He hadn’t been well for a while but it was still a shock when he passed away. It’s given me a new appreciation of cricket and I’ve actually found a lot of determination to do my best because that was all he ever wanted me to do. Now, every time I play I find myself looking at the sky quite a lot and imagine him watching down.” Buttler’s voice is steady but his face is creased in pain. “It’s been a tough time but it’s given me a deeper appreciation for how much he and my mum did for me. I still really want to win and you feel disappointed when you don’t do well. But it’s not the be-all and end‑all as the loss of a parent really gives that perspective.” Jos Buttler says he has taken recent inspiration from Joe Root. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Thinking about grief he says: “A few people who have been through the same experience said: ‘Don’t judge yourself for how you feel. There’re times when you feel happy and you’re having a good time. Don’t think you shouldn’t because your dad passed away four weeks ago.’ It’s also OK to feel sad. Don’t just ignore it, you’ve got to try to deal with it. So I’m taking it slow and we’ll see how it goes.” He must have thought about his dad when England set their world‑record T20 score of 304 for two, five weeks after his death? “Yes,” Buttler says quietly. “My dad would have absolutely loved that match. He’d have been glued to the TV. He was a very nervous watcher, in the latter years, but he’d have recorded it and replayed it the next day.” Did he sense early on that he and fellow opener Phil Salt had set the foundation for an extraordinary world record? “More so when I got out. I remember seeing the graphic where we were on 166 after 10 overs. I’d been asked in India who’ll be the first team to score 300 in the IPL. I said: ‘I don’t think anyone will do it.’ But then it dawned on me that we could.” Buttler shakes his head in amazement. “After the game you’re sat in your team clothes and don’t want to take them off. You just want to savour the highlights and everyone talking about what a day it was. When you’ve played for a long time you know it doesn’t happen every day. So take it in.” skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s got a great way of talking to the group. He doesn’t get too high or too low but he was so proud and said: ‘Look what’s possible with the talent you guys have got.” That simple joy contrasts with the anguish that Buttler sometimes experienced as England’s white‑ball captain – despite leading them to victory in the T20 World Cup in 2022. “I’m getting more and more clarity and acceptance on that time. Some people said I was a certain way and I would have ego and say: ‘No, I’m not upset. I’m not angry.’ Now, without the mask on, I can say: ‘Maybe I was upset.’ I lost a bit of self‑awareness because the 2023 World Cup in India was a huge confidence knock. I probably never recovered from that as a leader and never had the same conviction again.” Harry Brook replaced him as captain this summer and, for Buttler, “a big burden’s been lifted. Even when I went home I took this dark cloud. That, absolutely, has been lifted.” Jos Buttler begins the England celebrations after running out New Zealand’s Martin Guptill off the last ball of the super over to win the World Cup in 2019. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Joe Root struggled as England’s Test captain but, since relinquishing the role, his batting has reached supreme levels. “Definitely,” Buttler says of his close friend. “During my first game, not being captain, Joe was in the side which really helped. I kept wicket, he was at slip and I said: ‘God, it’s a bit weird, isn’t it, when you’re not captain any more?’ Joe said it’s normal to feel like this. He said when people talk in the dressing room in a positive way, sometimes it makes you feel like they’re talking negatively about your captaincy. You have to realise that’s not the case. Seeing how much he’s enjoying cricket, and playing so well, gives me lots of comfort you can have a great time post-captaincy.” After a brief white‑ball tour of New Zealand this month, Buttler will have a six-week break before playing franchise cricket in South Africa. But he will be consumed by watching the Ashes. “The Ashes are strange for me because, obviously, it’s the best series but my own performances were really poor. I’ve got fond memories of watching other players do well, and being in teams that won in 2015 and drew in 2019 when Australia retained the urn. It’s more intense than anything else in cricket and, in 2015, I completely overbuilt it. I made it such a big thing and asked so many people: ‘Why is it so hard? What do I need to do?’ It was a good lesson because I spoke to way too many people and was paralysed by all that information.” Jos Buttler reacts after losing his wicket in the 2023 World Cup defeat to Sri Lanka. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Buttler played four Tests in Australia in 2021-22, England losing the first three badly and clinging on for a draw in Sydney. “It was a tough time. My last-ever Test was in Sydney, where I broke my finger. I think my head was on the chopping block anyway and we were just outplayed. But this very different England team is now in a really good place.” Buttler smiles when I ask him for an Ashes prediction. “England to win 3-2 in an absolute classic. I think we’ve got an amazing chance with such a settled team. Everything’s coming into place at the right time.” Buttler’s and Broad’s podcast should reach fresh heights during a compelling series. They’ve already developed a relaxed rapport while conducting fascinating in-depth interviews with people as different as McCullum and Justin Langer. “I’ve learned how much I love talking about cricket,” Buttler says. “It’s obviously a big part of everything that we do, and it’s shaped everything, but getting the chance to talk in detail with Broady has been so enjoyable. And it’s been great learning new skills without it affecting my cricket.” The T20 and 50-over World Cups both take place next year. It’s telling that, after all his reflections on life and loss, Buttler is clear when he outlines his remaining ambitions in cricket: “I want to win something again, especially with England in another World Cup. To experience that winning dressing room again would be special. “I’ll never forget what it was like lifting that trophy in 2022 with your team all around you. That probably got tainted by the next few years. But when we won the [50-over] World Cup in 2019 it was never tainted. It would be good to have that feeling again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/30/jos-buttler-world-cup-england-ashes-cricket-captaincy,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c1f3647ab8441e5a89d753b1307216487b020d/0_2068_5460_4369/master/5460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fba6827ec9ccf5c1bb8646f26c5b1013",2025-09-30T18:00:49+00:00,8bc349433d5f351dee5c153bb455b0b5c01362e4
67f847a87d9b,From Egypt to Halifax: what happened when I pursued my football dream,,"F ootball has given me some wonderful experiences. As a young Arab and Egyptian woman playing for Stoke City from 2017 to 2021 I broke barriers and that paved the way for some exciting opportunities. Fifa selected me as a 2022 World Cup ambassador and put me in a film with David Beckham; I also became an Adidas ambassador and worked as an Afcon pundit for the BBC. But there have been less easy times as well. As an Egyptian international, representing a country that stands 95th in the Fifa rankings, there are obstacles to playing in the biggest leagues. Because of the points system for international players I left Stoke for the chance of playing second-tier football in Spain with Albacete. And since coming back to England, I’ve seen a world very distant from the new riches of the WSL. My recent experience at Halifax in the third tier of the pyramid – the semi-pro Women’s National League Division One North – is a case in point. I’ve decided to write about it to highlight the difficulties faced at that level, particularly for those who come from abroad – on a student visa – and end up struggling to get by, often with nothing more than club expenses. I initially moved to Halifax in February, for the last three months of the season, and scored six goals in 11 matches to help them stay in the division. I agreed to play for expenses which was fine as I was on a student visa and staying with family in Manchester. Over the summer, Halifax overhauled their squad but the manager, Rob Mitchell, wanted to keep me on, together with the two club captains. Initially I was reluctant to return because we couldn’t agree a basic package. But eventually we reached a verbal agreement – as is often the case at this level – and I bought a flight ticket and joined the team for their opening game, playing 45 minutes against Hull City on 17 August. Unfortunately, the reality proved very different from conversations I’d had. Just as when I first joined Halifax in February, I had come over on a student visa, which means your club cannot pay a wage (and this being semi-pro that would be limited anyway). But we had discussed accommodation and expenses, for travel and food. There was also – as I believed from a conversation with one of the club directors – the promise of support from the club in finding a job, which would enable me to upgrade my visa. The reality I encountered was a child’s bedroom in a scruffy-looking house in Rotherham, which I shared with two other players and a coach. It was an hour from the training ground. In the garden were pieces of broken furniture and bins that were overflowing. The wardrobe was dirty. I’d initially been put up in a Travelodge in Bradford, close to the training ground, but when I complained about the Rotherham house there was no apology or offer to help me find an alternative place to stay. Instead, the attitude seemed to change completely. When, after two days, I moved out and found a hotel room for myself, the strong sense I got was that they thought I was ungrateful and negative. There was no attempt to help me further so on 31 August I flew back to Cairo. Sarah Essam speaks at the women in sport conference at Stamford Bridge in June 2024. Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images I’ve lived in the UK before and studied for my degree in civil engineering at Derby University – so I wasn’t some homesick teenager suffering culture shock. I’d broken barriers as the first Egyptian to play at a good level in the English women’s pyramid. I’d showed hard work and resilience too. There was a period during my time at Stoke when players on student visas were banned in the third tier and I could only play for the reserve team for three years until the Home Office categorised the division as semi-pro. But this experience has left a sour taste. There are some good people at the club, including Rob, the manager, but I feel deeply let down and undermined by one director in particular. While my complaints led to an internal investigation, that concluded with the club offering me just a small goodwill payment – to be paid once I have returned the training kit the club gave me. Why am I writing this? To underline that for those of us from low-ranked nations chasing the dream, football really can be a struggle. I am lucky because I am 26 and have some experience of the world. But what if that experience had happened to a teenage girl, newly arrived in England? For me, it raises questions about the packages in place for players coming from other countries. Clubs have a duty of care, even the semi-pro ones. As for what comes next for me, I am back training with my old club, Wadi Degla, in Cairo while considering offers – including one from a team in Italy. I would love to play in the UK again one day but only in a serious environment. Hopefully it will happen again one day as, despite this setback, that Egyptian girl who arrived in England in the same year as Mo Salah joined Liverpool has certainly not lost any of her ambition. A couple of days before heading to Halifax I was on a stage in Cairo with Geremi Njitap, president of Fifpro Africa, and Egyptian football legend Magdy Abdelghany receiving an award for my achievements, including being the first Egyptian woman to play professionally in Spain. I don’t want that to be my last. Response from Halifax Women: We take the welfare of all our players seriously and made every effort to support Sarah during her time at Halifax Women. Accommodation was offered as a goodwill gesture, transport and meals were provided, and no contractual obligations were in place. Her concerns were reviewed thoroughly, and support was found to have been offered within the limits of her visa and our agreed arrangements.

c82ccb45416c,Scotland’s priceless formula of winning games while being played off the park,,"GREAT SCOTT! Having watched his Scotland players win their second match in four days at Hampden Park, guaranteeing themselves a Geopolitics World Cup playoff spot at the very least, Steve Clarke was in typically upbeat and buoyant mood after a record 72nd game in charge. “I’m really disappointed – really, really disappointed,” Clarke mithered, sounding as morose as it is possible for even the most relentlessly pessimistic Scotsman to be. “It’s possibly as disappointed as I’ve been over the whole 72 games. We just didn’t turn up. I don’t think we got anywhere near the levels we can reach and that was really disappointing.” For an almost comically dour man who appears to have hit upon the priceless formula of coaching a team to win matches in which they have been played off the park, Scotland’s manager could have been excused for cutting uncharacteristically loose and revelling in the fact that for the second game running, his side had ridden their luck and pulled off something of a smash-and-grab. His concerns, though, are nothing if not legitimate. In a parallel universe so unequivocally Scottish it would be wearing a See You Jimmy hat and soundtracked by the shrieking of bagpipes and angry Tartan Army conscripts, Clarke’s side would have been hammered by a less profligate Greece team on Thursday, before being humiliated on their own turf by the Group C whipping boys from Belarus last night. Somewhat miraculously – and aided in no small part by gift-bearing Greeks and equally generous officiating – Scotland not only avoided defeat but somehow contrived to win both games. In doing so, they have given themselves an excellent chance of qualifying for next summer’s north American jamboree without having to negotiate the inevitable trauma of a playoff. Should they avoid defeat against a dispirited Greece side for whom the Geopolitics World Cup jig is now well and truly up, Scotland can almost certainly look forward to a winner-takes-all denouement against Denmark next month at Hampden. A mouthwatering prospect, it would be a game where their recent Sheep Heid Inn XI tribute acts are highly unlikely to butter too many parsnips. “We know we have got to be better, man,” said Scott McTominay, whose look of brooding intensity in lieu of celebration upon scoring what turned out to be Scotland’s decisive goal against Belarus called to mind the “smell the fart” acting technique famously employed by Joey on Friends. So appalled by his own team’s performance that he refused to dignify his strike with any reaction more celebratory than some relieved effing and jeffing, McTominay was far from alone in realising that Scotland had just about got away with it again. Fans who had converged on Hampden expecting to see a turkey shoot seemed unsure of how best to respond to yet another winning performance in which their team only very narrowly avoided blunderbussing themselves in both feet. Having heard his side’s efforts greeted with some low-key boos, Clarke decided the best way to put the horrors of what he’d seen unfold behind him with some low-key booze of his own. “Maybe I’ll go back to the hotel and have a quiet beer,” he told reporters.

8a4d78514c88,Why there is no such thing as a perfect football tactic,,"Do you believe playing styles are developing incrementally or cyclically? Will things naturally come back around, or is it more a matter of rock, paper, scissors where one style counters another for a short while, as the current style gets broadly adopted? – Paul I dislike the term “cyclical” for tactics because it implies inevitability. Winter, spring, summer, autumn is a cycle; what happens in football tactics is not. When older ideas are repurposed for the modern age, they come with knowledge of what went before. So, to take an extreme example, when Pep Guardiola started fielding teams in a sort of 3-2-2-3 shape, it wasn’t the W-M used by Herbert Chapman in the late 1920s , because in the 100 years since, football has changed enormously: players are fitter, pitches are better, kit is better, we understand pressing, we have data and sophisticated analytical modelling. Equally, we should be cautious of imagining there is a preferred model – that one tactical system is necessarily better than another. It’s not that there is a best way to play and everybody is striving to achieve the style closest to that. Everything is contingent: there is only ever a best way to play for a particular set of players in particular circumstances. That said, there are clearly periods when one style is dominant. The arrival of Rafa Benítez and José Mourinho to English football in the summer of 2004, for instance, made control the defining attitude of the Premier League. The appointment of Pep Guardiola in 2016 brought his juego de posición to England, which has had a huge impact throughout the divisions, even as he evolved. First, there was the challenge of Jürgen Klopp, which resulted in Guardiola’s approach and German Gegenpressing moving closer together. Since then, he has inverted full-backs, gone to a back four comprised entirely of central defenders, and had John Stones stepping forward as the signing of Erling Haaland effectively meant the centre-forward no longer functioned as an auxiliary midfielder. Over the last few months, there has been a radical change . There seems a general acceptance, not least from Guardiola himself, that the style he brought to England is no longer effective. Last season he spoke of the likes of Bournemouth and Newcastle playing modern football – although, in context, he was talking less about having players run more with the ball (as it has been widely interpreted) than about how the crowded fixture list makes it almost impossible to prepare players properly for juego de posición , which requires a different strategic approach for every game. In that sense, the recent shift towards more direct football is less cyclical or incremental than reactive – a means of dealing with external factors. More generally, football finds itself not so much in a cycle as in a series of competing dialectics. As the emphasis on maintaining possession grew, central defenders – at least at elite clubs – began to be selected less for their defensive qualities than for their ability to pass the ball. That meant less focus on strength or heading ability, leaving them vulnerable against big, powerful centre-forwards. Bring back the big lumbering centre-backs of old, though, and they become susceptible to a well-targeted press. But then, big centre-forwards may not be capable of the constant rapid sprints required to press effectively. And that’s just one element. We’ve got used to wide forwards who cut infield on to their stronger foot, but as centre-forwards get bigger, better at heading and perhaps less adept at vacating space for a teammate cutting infield, it may be that a preference grows for wide players who do not invert but beat the full-back on the outside to put in outswinging crosses. There are always wheels within wheels, and that means terms like “cyclical” or “incremental” will always seem reductive. With summer temperatures in North America consistently hot, will we see a return to the type of World Cup we saw in 1970 and 1982 when oppressive heat reduced the efficacy of pressing? And does this open up the tournament to teams who could pack the pitch with creative No 10s? – Jonathan I enjoyed your newsletter in September about the new defensive mentality in football, where, as you pointed out, “we are seeing a more physical game centred on crosses, set plays and giving nothing away.” Do you think we’ll see that at next year’s World Cup too? – Bethany skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The temperature definitely will be a factor. Consistent pressing will be very difficult and, as at the Club World Cup, I think we’ll see spells in games in which both teams effectively take a breather. Most sides, I suspect, will sit deep in a low block, which means very little space for No 10s. It may be that what ends up being effective is controlling the pace of games, remaining tight defensively and breaking down opponents through attrition. Set plays are likely to be a major factor. In 2022 we had Morocco making a surprise run to the semi-finals, and in 2018 Croatia got all the way to the final itself. Which “smaller” nation do you think could make a deep run this time around (I’ve got my eye on Norway)? – Wally It’s slightly baffling that the World Cup is such a closed shop, when there have been shocks at the Euros, the Africa Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup. But it does seem that something about the occasion – or having to play one game more than at confederational tournaments – makes a big difference. Morocco again and Senegal are probably the likeliest African sides to have a decent run (or DR Congo if they make it through the play-offs). As you say, Norway, who have had some excellent players for a while now, are playing extremely well, and Switzerland have become a very consistent side. But the team I think could really surprise people is Ecuador , who have the likes of Moisés Caicedo, Willian Pacho and Pervis Estupiñán, and qualified second from Conmebol.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/13/jonathan-wilson-tactics,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c127d3a4b8889401d8361389119223a88c60ec50/0_6_4979_3983/master/4979.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dea4059d249ea67fca60296a9ecb99c3",2025-10-13T14:37:52+00:00,8bca8c63d98575b64e19319ccd9bdbe7265bc2d6
bc003b66df46,Danish villain sent packing in Swedish football’s attempt at Nordic noir,,"DANISH BACON Something is rotten in the state of … Sweden, though it’s a Dane taking the blame. Jon Dahl Tomasson, one-time Newcastle flop turned elite Feyenoord and Milan forward and former Blackburn manager, has just been sent packing after presiding over historic failure as manager of his neighbouring country. “Resign JDT” read one banner in Stockholm’s national stadium after Sweden lost 2-0 to Switzerland on Friday, while another read “danskjävel”, roughly translated as JDT’s nationality within a portmanteau questioning his parentage. Yes, that’s Sweden, the country that boasts Alexander Isak, the Premier League’s most expensive striker, and Viktor Gyökeres, last year’s European Golden Boot winner who hardly came cheap to Arsenal. The midfield trio of Daniel Svensson, of Borussia Dortmund, Lucas Bergvall of Tottenham and Brighton’s Yasin Asari reeks of talent and promise. Monday night, again at home, and the calls for Tomasson’s head continued after a 1-0 loss to Kosovo. They wouldn’t have to wait long to get their wish. Noa Bachner, red-hot columnist for Swedish outlet Expressen, pushed the button, writing: “No acceptable arguments for anything other than him being replaced. I haven’t been this sure since Alan Pardew managed Newcastle.” Which seems a tad harsh on the man briefly labelled “Pardiola” on Tyneside. Tomasson, in mitigation, was not helped by both Isak and Gyökeres playing well below their capabilities, with both given plunging ratings across the national press. “We have full confidence in our national coach until we don’t,” wailed the Arsenal legend and Swedish FA suit Kim Källström after the match. It appears that faith melted away overnight like an Ikea candle. “The decision [to sack Tomasson] is based on the fact that the men’s national team has not delivered the results we hoped for,” Swedish FA chief suit Simon Åström roared on Tuesday afternoon. “There is still a chance of a playoff in March and our responsibility is to ensure that we have as optimal conditions as possible to be able to reach a [Geopolitics] World Cup playoff. In this, we assess that a new leadership is required in the form of a new coach.” Barring a mathematical miracle in their final matches with Switzerland and Slovenia, the nation of Nils Liedholm, Ralf Edström, “Brolin-Dahlin-Brolin!”, Henrik Larsson and Anders Svensson’s roulette will be missing out on a trip across the Atlantic next summer. With Denmark top of their group, Norway the most in-form team in all qualifying – with Erling Haaland plundering goals like Ragnar Lodbrok – the Swedes are letting the Nordic region down. To compound an ennui not widely heard since Abba’s The Visitors album was released comes the exploits of the Faroe Islands, the region’s minnows. The football nation previously best known for being skitted by Richard Keys and a goalie in a bobble hat retain a fighting chance of being in North America next summer. Beating Czechia on Sunday even led one august UK publication to declare the Faroes are “smaller than Taunton”. Meanwhile, a battalion of hacks rub their hands in glee at getting to patronise interview a bunch of office workers and trawlermen for their Geopolitics World Cup previews. With a game in Croatia to come while the Czechs host Gibraltar, the Faroes’ chances seem slim yet far healthier than Sweden’s – they can still dream. And at least Eyoun Klakstein, their coach, is not being compared to Pardew.

2ea89c5044cc,Champion Stakes at Ascot attracts the best but faces fight to maintain status,,"T he Champion Stakes at Ascot, the highlight of the track’s Champions Day card this weekend, has barely figured in the official annual assessment of the “World’s Best Horse Race” since the prize – which is based on the average end-of-year rating of the first four horses home – was first awarded in 2015. The 2022 Champion, in which Bay Bridge beat Adayar with the previously unbeaten Baaeed fourth, was the runner-up behind Flightline’s sign-off win in the Breeders’ Cup Classic a couple of weeks later, but five of the past 10 runnings have failed to make even the top 10 globally. To date, York’s International Stakes, in 2020 and 2024, is the only British race to finish at the top of the pile. Ascot’s executives will quietly fancy their chances this year, however, after three of the top 12 horses worldwide at any distance all stood their ground for Saturday’s £1.3m Champion Stakes at Monday’s five-day stage. Ombudsman, currently top of the global rankings on 128 thanks to his emphatic success in the International Stakes in August, faces a decider in his head-to-head with Delacroix, who beat him in the Eclipse and went on to win the Irish Champion Stakes. But it is far from a two-horse race with Calandagan, the King George winner , and Almaqam, the only horse apart from Delacroix to beat Ombudsman this year, also in the mix alongside William Haggas’s Economics, the Irish Champion Stakes winner last year. The best news of all for racegoers and armchair fans alike, meanwhile, is that the weather forecast remains dry and settled before a Champions Day card that will feature five Group One races for the first time, following the upgrade of the Long Distance Cup from Group Two status. It is also a seven-race card for the first time this year, following the addition of a £250,000 two-year-old contest as the opening race, and all five Group Ones received supplementary entries on Monday as owners and trainers were encouraged by the prospect of decent racing ground and, in the case of the three events on the round course, the certainty that there will be no switch to the hurdles track, a last resort that has been forced on the track three times since 2019.

Photograph: Damien Eagers/PA The Champions Day card this year will be the 15th since the Champion Stakes itself was moved from Newmarket – amid much grumbling from the traditional wing of racing’s fanbase – to be the climax of Britain’s richest day at the races, and an equivalent of Champions Weekend in Ireland and Arc weekend in Paris in the nation that gave racing to the world. It was mightily blessed by the presence of Frankel in both its inaugural year in 2011 and then a year later, when the greatest horse of modern times bowed out in the feature event. There were just two Group Ones on the schedule until the Fillies & Mares event got an upgrade in 2013, and the Sprint became the card’s fourth Group One two years later, but Saturday’s seven-race card is arguably the first with the full range and depth of quality to stand serious comparison with the showpiece meetings in France and Ireland. And in a good year, like this one, it certainly holds its own. In addition to the star-studded Champion Stakes, the likely attractions on Saturday include Field Of Gold, joint-second in the global rankings, in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Lazzat, second in the sprint ratings, in the Champions Sprint. Trawlerman, meanwhile, is officially the world’s best stayer this year, and should prove the point in what is, admittedly, a slightly underwhelming six-horse field for the Long Distance Cup.

The problem that still faces Champions Day, however, even in what could now be seen as its fully fledged form, is that key factors which determine its year-to-year success are beyond the organisers’ control. It is still sandwiched uncomfortably between the Arc and the Breeders’ Cup, both of which offer significantly high prize money, while the latter event at least comes with an effective guarantee of fast ground. At Ascot in mid-October, by contrast, 12 of the 14 renewals of the Champion Stakes since the switch from Newmarket have been run on ground with “soft” in the going description.

The Irish Champions Festival in Ireland attracted 20,000 spectators over two days this year, around 10,000 fewer than Ascot will get on Saturday. Yet it remains firmly entrenched on the September weekend that, in an ideal world, Champions Day would probably occupy, giving owners the chance to run at Ascot, Longchamp and then the Breeders’ Cup. Fair play to Ireland – they got there first.

a7a8e18f19ea,Has Drake Maye ended the Patriots’ painful Tom Brady hangover?,,"Y ou have to feel for the Browns, Jets, and Bears. Those franchises have spent decades in quarterback purgatory, rotating through prospects and placeholders. Meanwhile, after just five years of searching, the Patriots – the post-Tom Brady Patriots – appear to have found the guy. Five years. From Brady to Cam Newton to Mac Jones to Bailey Zappe to Maye’s first choppy season to this: a 23-year-old quarterback who looks like a top-five starter and MVP candidate. Last week was his breakout: a road win in Buffalo, where Maye went throw-for-throw with Josh Allen and outplayed the reigning MVP in the fourth quarter. But Sunday in New Orleans may have been even more impressive. Fresh off an upset win over the division favorites, a trip to a lousy Saints team had potential for a letdown. And the Saints teased an upset early. They ripped off a big play on the opening snap of the game, before stalling out in the redzone and settling for a field goal. It took Maye all of four plays to respond, uncorking a 53-yard deep ball to DeMario Douglas for the go-ahead touchdown. It was Maye at his best, climbing through the pocket to deliver a strike downfield. From there, he didn’t let up: Maye torched the Saints in every area of the field. His first half was so searing that even North Carolina was forced to tweet . He finished 18-of-26 for 261 yards with three touchdowns and no turnovers. And it could have been more if not for a trio of questionable officiating calls . It was his fifth straight game with at least 200 yards and a passer rating north of 100. Only Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, and Dan Marino have ever done that at age 23 or younger. The best quarterbacks turn difficult road games into ho-hum wins. They don’t put the ball in harm’s way, keep the offense chugging and make the decisive throws on crucial downs. The Patriots needed every bit of Maye’s near perfection to squeeze by the Saints. They couldn’t run the ball against a stout front. Their defense gave up multiple chunk plays. This was a game that had to be won by Maye’s right arm. And he delivered under fire. Maye was hit a few times and sacked once, but the pressure he faced was constant. It didn’t matter. Maye threw all three touchdown passes under pressure, with all three traveling 20 yards or more in the air. It’s not just the numbers though. It’s how Maye carries himself. He’s confident and composed in the pocket, bouncing through reads to find open targets. When needed, he can take off and create with his legs. As a rookie, he was a little chaotic, fleeing the pocket at the first sign of trouble. But this season, he’s been more like Brady, conforming to the confines of the scheme and getting the ball where it needs to go in a hurry. Drake Maye stats For the season, Maye is up to 10 passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns and just two interceptions. He’s halved his Turnover Worthy Play rate from his rookie year, when he was constantly trying to conjure magic out of broken plays. Now, he’s picking his moments. He hasn’t committed a TWP in three games, per PFF. Coming out of college, Maye was billed as a big-armed bomber. Evaluators questioned his ability to process sophisticated coverages and operate a complex offense. Too loose. Too reckless. But Josh McDaniels, in his third tour as Patriots offensive coordinator, has unleashed the full breadth of his scheme. Maye isn’t being limited; he’s being trusted . The Patriots are shapeshifting weekly again, and Maye is piloting the offense like an eight-year vet. His growth has accelerated the Patriots’ timeline. If there were to be second-year progress, you imagined it would be a slow burn. There would still be the highlight throws, while Maye spent the season trying to cut his brain-farts-per-game in half. That would be progress. Instead, Maye has smashed expectations. Six games into his second season, he’s turned into one of the league’s best – and he’s made the Patriots division contenders again. Bears fans will take some comfort in seeing the development of Caleb Williams. But if you’re a Browns or Jets fan, you have to wince. Because this is what it’s supposed to look like when a franchise quarterback arrives. And for the rest of the league’s quarterback-starved franchises, it’s yet another reminder of how cruel and cyclical this sport can be. The Patriots went from the greatest of all time to a possible great in half a decade. Some teams spend a quarter of a century looking – and still don’t find anyone. Finding a franchise quarterback is about more than winning games. It alters the personality of a fanbase and franchise. For 20 years, the Pats lived the gilded life. But the last few seasons have been about failing to build a bridge from Brady to whatever would come next. They’ve found the answer now. Prepare for your Masshole friends to rediscover their Brady-era bluster. MVP of the week Jaxon Smith-Njigba was in an understandably chipper mood after Sunday’s game. Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/AP Jaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, Seattle Seahawks. Against a stifling Jaguars defense, Seattle’s only way forward was for Sam Darnold to look for Smith-Njigba, anywhere and everywhere. The receiver responded with eight catches for 162 yards and a touchdown on 13 targets, as the Seahawks snuck past the Jags 20-12. Seattle’s defense led the way, hounding Trevor Lawrence and dropping him a season-high seven times. But it was Smith-Njigba who carried the Seahawks’ offense, making up all 117 of the Seahawks’ initial 117 yards through the air. That included a 61-yard touchdown and maybe the nastiest route we’ll see from a receiver all year. Video of the week The Dolphins were on the wrong side of yet another disappointing, late defeat. They took a one-point lead over the Chargers with 48 seconds left, after Tua Tagovailoa found Darren Waller for his fourth touchdown of the season. The Chargers then popped a 40-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. From there, Justin Herbert and Ladd McConkey took over: Hoo boy. That is mean. Somehow, Herbert was able to evade two oncoming pass-rushers, slipping past the first before tossing the other to the deck. He found McConkey in the flat, who put a Dolphins’ corner on skates to move the ball in range for the game-winning field goal. It sums up the Chargers’ season: squeaking by on the excellence of Herbert and his surrounding playmakers as his offensive line flails. And it sums up the Dolphins’ defense, too: a pass-rush that struggles to finish and a floundering secondary. With the defeat, the Dolphins fell to 1-5. Miserable second-half collapses have become standard for Mike McDaniel’s team. With another rough loss, he’s running out of time to save his job. Stat of the week Justin Fields struggled all day against the Broncos in London. Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA Minus-10 . That’s the net passing yards Justin Fields finished with in the Jets’ 13-11 loss to the Broncos in London. It’s the fewest in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 in 1998, according to the Associated Press . Even then, the Chargers had Ryan Leaf making his third professional start. Fields was making his 49th. We know who Fields is now: an exceptional runner who struggles to decipher the passing game. He’s late to read defenses, late to let the ball go and struggles with the rhythmic demands of the league. And against a fearsome Broncos defensive front, Fields’ flaws were brutally exposed. He was sacked as many times (nine) as he completed a pass. Despite falling to 0-6 and his quarterback’s continuing struggles, Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said post-game he is not considering benching Fields. “There’s 11 games left,” Fields said. Based on Sunday’s performance, that sounds more like a threat than words of encouragement. Elsewhere around the league Patrick Mahomes’s Chiefs are 3-3 after their win over the Lions. Photograph: Ed Zurga/AP -- The Chiefs’ loss to the Jaguars in Week 5 looks more like a blip than a crisis after Kansas City dominated the Detroit Lions in a 30-17 win on Sunday night. Yes, the Lions have a depleted secondary but Mahomes – who had three passing TDs and another rushing – was excellent as he found Travis Kelce time and again. And remember that Mahomes has another target, Rashee Rice, returning from suspension next week. The Lions shouldn’t be too disheartened, many of their injured players will return in a month or so, just in time for a late season charge. The game also featured an entertainingly petty scuffle between the teams after Brian Branch apparently refused to high-five Mahomes at the end of the contest. -- “They wasn’t bucked up,” Panthers running back Rico Dowdle said after gaining 239 yards from scrimmage and scoring a touchdown against the Cowboys. On the list of Dallas’ offseason sins, not extending Dowdle after he rushed for 1,000 yards last season is rising. The Panthers scooped him up on a bargain deal, and he ran all over the Cowboys’ hapless defense in Sunday’s 30-27 win. Note from NFL Research: Dowdle’s 239 scrimmage yards are the most by a player in a game against his former team in league history. -- Who had Baker Mayfield as an MVP frontrunner six weeks into the season? The Bucs quarterback kept up his early-season heater in a 30-19 win over the Niners, who lost star linebacker Fred Warner for the season to a horrible ankle injury. It was a game in which Mayfield, already down two starting receivers, lost rookie phenom Emeka Egbuka to a hamstring injury . The Bucs were also forced to play their sixth-string guard. Neither setback bothered Mayfield, who completed 17-of-23 pass attempts for 256 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. And he added another play to his MVP reel. On a crucial third-and-14, Baker went full Beast Mode , slipping away from a sack, scrambling, stiff-arming a defender, then diving through two tacklers to pick up a first down. Two plays later, he delivered a 45-yard dart to rookie Tez Johnson for a touchdown. -- It was another disastrous performance for the Cowboys’ defense, but their offense continues to be excellent despite missing all five of their starters on the offensive line. Dak Prescott completed 25 of 34 pass attempts for 261 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers or sacks against the Panthers. George Pickens was his go-to target, and he fried Carolina’s undermanned secondary for 168 yards and a touchdown on nine grabs. The Prescott-to-Pickens connection has been everything Dallas hoped for after acquiring the former Steelers receiver in the offseason. Attention will quickly turn to Pickens’s upcoming contract extension. Will Jerry Jones fork over $100m-plus for another receiver after inking CeeDee Lamb to a long-term extension and trading away Micah Parsons, in part, to save money? -- It was a survive and advance week for the Colts, who needed a late redzone stop to knock off a feisty Cardinals team 31-27. Indy’s offense continued to roll, putting up 30 points for the fourth time this season. But Indy’s defense struggled to contain a Cardinals offense led by backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who may have forced some in Arizona to take a sideways glance at Kyler Murray. -- What is going on in Indianapolis during warmups? Backup quarterback – and potential trade candidate – Anthony Richardson sustained an orbital fracture in the locker room prior to the Colts’ game against the Cardinals. According to ESPN , Richardson was hit in the eye by an exercise band when a device malfunctioned. Richardson was not the only one who suffered before the game: Charvarius Ward was ruled out with a concussion after he accidentally collided with tight end Alec Ogletree. -- The hampered Ravens dropped to 1-5 after losing 17-3 at home to the Rams, making it the worst start to a season in Jon Harbaugh’s 18-year tenure with the franchise. Baltimore will hit the bye at the lowest ebb of the Harbaugh era. If they can get the bulk of their starters back from injury after the break, they could still make a playoff run. But the odds of turning the season around are dwindling. Since the current playoff format started in 2020, only one team – Washington in 2020 – has started 1-5 and made the playoffs.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/13/drake-maye-new-england-patriots-quarterback,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9057a7a662c4320523eb744ed1a3c69672ca1ce5/292_0_2912_2331/master/2912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34c2862b28d128e322c04147a5dd6d2c",2025-10-13T07:20:14+00:00,e72b360d62a10f54123d9c78ca7e94b694d08038

a6f9e661035d,How Limp Bizkit Ended Up On the Soundtrack for ‘Battlefield 6’,,"To the surprise of absolutely no one, Battlefield 6 has been a major hit, with fans across all platforms rushing to game’s multiplayer mode for one purpose: break stuff. With a peak concurrent player count of over 747,000 users on Steam alone for the game’s Oct. 10 launch day, Battlefield 6 has been dominating the charts in its opening week. Our own review of Battlefield 6 called the game a throwback military fantasy that operates on the same wavelength as 2000s-era multiplayer shooters, which totally aligns with the direction of the game’s soundtrack. An early leak of the in-game audio revealed licensed tracks from bands like Godsmack and Drowning Pool, but one collaboration has gone further — rap-rock maestros Limp Bizkit have partnered with EA Games to contribute not just one of their classic songs (“ Break Stuff ”) to the trailer , but to create entirely new music for the game. The first is the wildly named “ Making Love to Morgan Wallen ,” which was released back in September . The second track, “ Battlefield: The After-party,” is a full reimagining of the traditional Battlefield theme, produced in cooperation with the game’s composer, Henry Jackman. Rolling Stone has an exclusive video interview featuring Jackman and Limp Bizkit frontman, Fred Durst , detailing how the collaboration came to be. You can watch the full video below. In the video, Jackman details the development of the new game’s score, noting that one specific theme was paramount. “In a really early meeting, I just threw out, ‘Does anyone got like a sentence or key word?’ And I guess, it not being a romantic comedy — it being a video game — the word that came out straight away was ‘destruction,’” Jackman says. Jackman, whose body of work encompasses films like Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Kong: Skull Island (2017), also has extensive credits on high-profile video games including PlayStation’s Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End (2016). Going into designing the music for Battlefield 6 , he knew exactly that kind of attitude he wanted to bring to the project. “There was a lot of aggression techniques in the engineering and [production]. It’s not polite.” The dearth of politeness in the game’s score left Jackman and co. searching for the right partner to help put their mark on this new, more aggressive era of Battlefield . Enter Limp Bizkit. Durst, a well-known gamer himself, notes that the process began with questioning whether the composition would be all-new or building on the existing foundation. Speaking with Jackman, the singer says that the decision was to ultimately add to the work that had already been done. “It was more like, follow the yellow brick road — until we get to Henry,” Durst says. Battlefield 6 is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s soundtrack is now streaming.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/battlefield-6-limp-bizkit-soundtrack-1235446825,Entertainment,the guardians,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/limp-bizkit-battlefield-6.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T17:00:50+00:00,c3e42efe9dd123d5db0b29bbbe14aa78781537a9
3f75ac6ba44d,This Small Town Protected a Predator. Now His Survivors Are Fighting Back,,"I t seemed like any city council meeting: a beige, cinderblock room, metal chairs, a U-shaped table with a maroon tablecloth reading “Leonia Board of Education.” But for the men — some sporting matching T-shirts, claiming that they were survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved teacher — it signified a release, a silence broken. Paul King, 59, choked back sobs as he took the mic, his family thronged behind him on a school lunch table bench. “I hope that none of you have ever experienced sexual assault ,” he said in measured tones, despite the emotion. “So what do I want? That’s a good question. I don’t know. But I do know that I want what’s fair. I want the people that are victims to be free to come out. To heal. … There’s a saying that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This crisis has been going on for over 50 years.” “That was like the most I’ve ever seen him cry in my life,” King’s 24-year-old son, also named Paul, later tells me. He sat behind his father during his speech, nodding emphatically. “He was reaching really deep down into his memories, into his darkest, repressed stuff, to figure out what happened to him and convey it in a way that was more digestible for these guys sitting on the council.” Nearly half a century ago, King and his fellow survivors saw their idyllic enclave of Leonia, New Jersey , turn into a hostile place. A leafy, close-knit community less than 10 miles from New York City, Leonia isn’t that kind place where tragedy often happens — in fact, it was the model for the suburban utopia depicted in Disney’s WandaVision . But, much like in that show, there was unease beneath the surface: back in the Eighties, King and the rest watched as their beloved hometown rallied around elementary school teacher John Anagnosti, a.k.a. Mr. A — despite the fact that Mr. A was convicted of abusing one of their fellow students. It was a stunning state of affairs: a young boy’s pain dismissed, his abuser given a slap on the wrist and thousands of dollars of legal support from local parents. Now, though, due to expanding statutes of limitations on child sexual abuse cases, more and more of those who say they are Mr. A’s victims are coming forward, including two brothers who sued the school board, settling for a combined $6 million. As one of the plaintiff’s attorneys claims, more than a dozen survivors could be coming forward in the coming weeks — alleged victims of abuse that reportedly spanned nearly 15 years. And his supporters? Some have apologized to survivors; others are now silent. AT 66, MICHAEL GONZALES RESEMBLES a svelte Santa Claus, wiry and strong. But back in the 1970s, he was an eight-year-old with a high and tight haircut and a mischievous smile — a Dennis the Menace incarnate. He also believes he was likely Mr. A’s first victim. Joe and Mike Gonzales both say they were victims of Mr. A. Courtesy of the Gonzalez Family At the time, unconventional teaching was all the rage: field trips, dinners at teachers’ houses, ballgames — anything to get fidgety, bored students engaged. Mr. A embraced that educational style, even earning him a glowing piece in the local paper in 1971 about a class trip to dig fossils with a Columbia University professor. ”I spend so many hours with the kids outside the classroom because that’s when I truly get to see them as human beings,” he later told The New York Times . ”They’re more open then. I feel that if I get to know them, I can help them.” Unfortunately, it seems, those outings also allowed Mr. A unfettered access to his alleged victims, like Gonzales. “The bell rings for lunch, and he would put his arm out to prevent me from going out the classroom door, and that’s when the molestation started,” Gonzales says. He says Mr. A molested him until seventh grade, roughly 500 times, a claim also included in his lawsuit against the school board. “All the kids are out in the school yard playing, and I’m here being molested. That same scenario over and over again, but not just in the classroom…. That all started with me; that was his plan on how he gathered the kids. That was his master plan.” Gonzales’ brother, Joe, also says he became one of Mr. A’s victims at age six, when Michael went by the teacher’s house to rake leaves with his brother in tow. Michael didn’t find out until years later, but the experience nearly ruined both of the brothers’ lives. “I became a bully. I ruined friendships,” Michael says. “I came out of high school and I didn’t know how to read, because I couldn’t concentrate.” Joe, 60, turned to drinking at age 12; he was 35 days sober when we spoke. “I wasn’t born an alcoholic,” he says. “I was born a normal kid that was abused at five, six years old, and alcohol, it was a savior, and it is the love of my life.” The brothers’ pain only intensified in January of 1981, when an elementary school student publicly accused Mr. A of molestation. “I carried around that burden,” Michael says, his voice breaking. “Why didn’t I say something? It’s not what he did to me. These kids [that he may have abused], who knows if they’re even alive…. It’s just a total failure of humanity.” It didn’t help that the people of Leonia seemed firmly on Mr. A’s side back in 1981. When the child’s father paraded through the town center with a sign proclaiming the teacher’s guilt — then took the pulpit at the Presbyterian Church to do the same — he was charged with harassment, and endangering his child by keeping him out of school, and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to The New York Times . Mr. A wasn’t completely able to escape consequences. In spring of that year , following an investigation he was charged with molesting the student, pleaded guilty, and resigned. Still, by June, he’d changed his tune — especially after local parents had raised $7,500 for his defense. Mr. A then opted to retract his plea, claiming that he’d only fessed up to the crime to spare the child “emotional trauma.” The case then moved to state Superior Court, and in 1982, he was convicted of sexual assault. It may seem strange in 2025 that Leonia would stand by an alleged child abuser, but even the headlines of the day reflect a different time: “Leonia Parents Support Teacher in Morals Case,” trumpets one, while another article, titled “Supporting a Neighbor,” casts a benefit dinner at All Saints Episcopal Church as a heartwarming communion in support of a beloved educator. ”When Mr. A resigned,” one child said, according to the paper, “we got a teacher who just told us what to do and sat there. Mr. A said it was better to learn by experiencing things. We went to New York to the planetarium, to the World Trade Center, to the Statue of Liberty and other places. The class would go to his house for dinner and talk about what we’d seen.” According to the the Times, the local TV shop even put up an open letter from Mr. A thanking the town for its support — a sore point for Joe, who worked at the store. Paul King had to walk by that poster every day on his walk to school, silently seething. “Joe told me, ‘Every time I walked into that TV [store], I look at that effing poster,” he says. “I’m thinking, ‘I’ve been abused for over two years by this guy, like big time.’…It wasn’t, ‘You show me your weenie and I’ll show you mine,’ it was full-on physical touching and beyond.’ But nobody believed the kid.” King has not filed a suit. Michael was similarly enraged by the support. He was on leave from the Army when he heard the news of Mr. A’s conviction, and wracked with guilt and shame (and alcohol), he went to the man’s house with the intention of killing him. Mr. A let him into his condo, and after calling his lawyer or psychiatrist — Michael isn’t sure which — Michael changed his mind. “You know, it tortures me,” he says. “I could have went to jail. I could have ruined my whole life.” Even after Mr. A was convicted of sexual assault, the judgment was muted. He received only three years of probation and a $25 fine. “I don’t know what other punishment this man deserves,” the judge opined at the time, while Mr. A took the stand to tell the court: “I would rather cut off my right hand than harm a hair on a child. My love for children is genuine.” It’s not all that surprising, then, that Leonia received a glowing write-up in the infamous pedophile magazine, Pan, an underground publication about “boy love.” “He was indicted by a grand jury in October. But instead of running him out of town, as, sadly, often happens in such cases, the community rallied to his support,” the magazine said. “It must have occurred to more than one of the good parents at the All Saints Episcopal Church: John Anagnosti is a paedophile in the true sense of the word; he loves children, and whether or not there is a sexual expression of this love would not seem to be very important.” MR. A DIED IN 2020, BUT THE MEN never forgot him — or what he did. And, at the time, they suffered in silence, since neither King nor the Gonzaleses knew that they shared the same abuser. “I had lost my hope,” Michael says. “I’m going to the grave with the secret. …I’m laying in bed, and I see this commercial on TV, and it says if you were molested by a teacher in New Jersey or something or another, to call this number. I called the number.” The law firm from the commercial then connected Michael with Baldante & Rubenstein, which has seen a massive uptick in such cases since New Jersey, along with several other states, changed its statute of limitations for child sexual abuse survivors in 2019. Now, Michael and his brother could fight back. “When you sit down with these victims and they start to tell their story, oftentimes we’re the first person they’ve ever spoken to about it,” lawyer John Baldante says. He adds that 80 to 90 percent of their cases deal with sexual abuse cases. “They start crying like the eight- and 10-year old-children that they were when they were abused. … One of my clients once said, ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever spoken out on behalf of that 10-year-old version of myself.’” With Baldante’s help, Joe and Michael each sued the Leonia Township Board of Education, alleging that the school and board knew about Mr. A’s reported actions, but did nothing to stop them. “Despite such knowledge,” Michael’s suit reads, “[the school] failed to adequately respond to stop harassment…against the plaintiff.” The brothers garnered a combined $6 million in separate settlements in 2024. Still, according to Michael’s daughter, Keegan, “this lawsuit wasn’t a payday. It was acknowledgement that something horrific happened, and the school system failed these kids. The story does not end here. We’re going to continue speaking about this, because this goes beyond compensation. We want people’s stories to be heard.” To date, Baldante says several other men have come forward with similar stories about Mr. A, and he expects there will be many more. The firm is in the process of working up further litigation. “There’s no question that there’s undoubtedly hundreds [of victims],” he claims. “Mr. A was the Pied Piper.” Although stressing that there are only three cases of litigation currently pending against the teacher and school board, Baldante says “in the context of cases against a single perpetrator within a public school Board of Education, the claims against Mr. A are evolving into one of the largest clusters of claims.” AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THAT city council meeting. Through a series of happenstances, Keegan met the younger Paul King, and they figured out that both their fathers claim to have been victims of Mr. A — right before the Gonzaleses and another alleged survivor, Daniel Schlademan, were due to speak at the meeting on June 17. In light of more and more alleged victims coming forward, the men planned to address the Board of Education, calling on them to take steps to bring closure and comfort to the victims, as well as concrete moves to ensure the safety of the town’s children in the future. Daniel Schlademan created a website so Mr. A’s victims could come forward. Courtesy of Dan Schlademan King joined them, and, one by one, they emptied their hearts in that ugly municipal board room. The men acknowledged that the school board is populated by far different people than it was 50 years ago, but they still want justice — and recognition of systemic failure. “The Leonia school district dismissed the reports of sexual abuse made by students and tried to sweep Anagnosti’s predatory conduct under the carpet,” says the lawyer, Baldante. “Unfortunately, these efforts by Leonia only compounded the problem.” “The Leonia School District is currently involved in active litigation related to these matters, and therefore we cannot provide specific comments,” said Daniel Lee, President of Leonia Board of Education. “That said, our lack of direct response to the public comments on this matter must not be mistaken for indifference to the pleas of those who have come forward. We recognize how painful these issues may be for victims, their families, and the wider community. We take this concern very seriously. The Board’s goal is always to foster a safe, supportive environment, and we are mindful of the role we can play in the healing process. At this moment, however, our legal and ethical responsibilities require restraint to avoid jeopardizing the district or those it serves now and in the future.” In a 2022 filing, the BOE denied “any wrongdoing or negligence,” adding: “The Board did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the allegations of sexual misconduct of Defendant John Anagnosti. The Board did not enable any alleged sexual abuse and the Board did not fail to take action with regards to any alleged sexual abuse.” Now, all the men can do is wait. Wait for the school board to listen to them. Wait for more people to come forward. Schlademan created a website in May outlining the town’s history with Mr. A called Voices of Leonia ; he’s currently fighting his own legal battle against the school board and declined to be interviewed for this article. Meanwhile, Baldante is interviewing more survivors of Mr. A in preparation for future lawsuits. And the Gonzaleses? They’re just continuing to heal. “It’s so important to me that this story is told,” Michael says. “Everybody’s at fault here — full circle. I’ve been disappointed so many times. This guy is a monster and nobody paid attention.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/teacher-sexual-assault-new-jersey-lawsuit-1235446051,Entertainment,the guardians,Brenna Ehrlich,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leonia-NJ-Pedophile-teacher_FINAL.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00,349292459e8ca46004b7f6c039015cbbe299bbd5
22f146345c0c,‘Pokémon Legends: Z-A’ Is a Middling Evolution for a Franchise in Need of Saving,,"The world’s biggest media franchise has been evolving. Since transitioning to 3D graphics with Pokémon X and Y (2013), the mainline series had stumbled through a period of stagnation — their eight gyms, each tackled in a specific order ending up in a showdown with the elite four, has become stale to fans. Pokémon Legends: Z-A (out Oct. 16), a sequel to X and Y , is the third of a few attempts to shake things up, following Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (2022) and Pokémon Legends: Arceus (2022). The Nintendo Switch era has been turbulent for the franchise, to put it mildly. Fan frustration finds a new target with each new release, whether it was the bland and forgettable nature of Sword and Shield (2019), the poor technical performance of Legends: Arceus or the unforgivable buggy mess that Scarlet and Violet were upon release. For the developers at Game Freak, their greatest achievement would be not providing fans with a comically large stick to beat the latest entry with. Boasting a brand new battle system and a compelling alternative to the gym challenge, Legends: Z-A succeeds at making a Pokémon game with its own flavor, but frustratingly stumbles over some familiar hurdles. The dream of a modern Pokémon experience we can call great without heavy qualification remains elusive. Throwing Chaos into the Pokémon Battle Much like its predecessor in the Legends sub-series, Z-A looks to redefine the Pokémon battle . Arceus took the route of allowing the player to manipulate the order of the turn-based combat, something that had operated on a strict “their turn, my turn” basis in the mainline games. This allowed for more dynamic clashes, aided by compelling, unique animations. Z-A takes the dynamism of its battles to the extreme, discarding the turn-based nature of it entirely and opting for fast and chaotic action, a shift that longtime fans will take a bit of time to adapt to. There are no turns, it’s about getting as many attacks off as possible and draining the opponent’s health points (HP) before they can land a fatal blow. The first few battles are a disorienting experience. Before the player can figure out how to even select their attacks, the opponent has removed a chunk of their HP through a move that could burst flames, water or psychic energy across the screen. It’s impossible to know where to look. Pokémon muscle memory will have experienced gamers take some time to pick a move and watch their partner execute it. Real-time battles can be chaotic and require recalibrating how the player approaches combat. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company In Z-A , by the time that process is complete, the Pokémon’s HP could be halved and attack power weakened. Keeping track of what both Pokémon are doing, each of their health bars, the animations for each attack and the battle log (which shows whether or not attacks have landed) takes a long time to get used to. It may take a few hours of playtime but when this action-based battle system clicks, it feels amazing to play out. Not only does the player start to understand where to look and when, but they’ll start to see the depth of strategy in the game. Z-A splits moves into short range and long range attacks. To execute the move Tackle, the Pokémon will have to go right up to its opponent to deliver the blow, leaving it at risk of being countered immediately. On the other hand, Hyper Beam can deliver its might from far enough that the opponent will have to reposition themselves before attacking. Balancing things are cooldown times, meaning Tackle can be used every four seconds, but Hyper Beam will take 12 seconds before it can be used again. The player is forced to make risk-reward judgments on the fly, which is especially stressful in battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon as well as Alpha Pokémon . The latter is a concept taken from Legends: Arceus describing huge Pokémon that have gone wild and aim their attacks at the trainer instead of their Pokémon. The same goes for Rogue Megas, except they take on an enhanced form, specialized to each Pokémon species, as introduced as the main gimmick in Pokémon X and Y . Having these giant beasts run straight past the Pokémon they should be fighting and directly at the player character (whose outfit they spent a lot of in-game money on) can be used to their advantage. Because of how much enemy Pokémon move around in Z-A , it’s very common for long range attacks to miss, almost like setting up a cannon to fire at a moving target. But by drawing the enemy Pokémon to the trainer, it gives the partner Pokémon a steady target to unleash its Flamethrower or Ice Beam at. Z-A Royale takes over the city each night with new trainers to face. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Mastery over battles will see trainers speed up the ranks of the Z-A Royale, a tournament unique to Lumiose City (where the entire game is played). The Z-A Royale stands in for the gym challenge and offers a fun, refreshing alternative. Every night the city is bathed in neon red as a purge-like event begins. Trainers will spot the main character in the street and begin battles on the fly, desperate to achieve A Rank and shape Lumiose in whichever sick and twisted way they want. Players skilled at raising strong Pokémon (or farming Rare Candies) should hardly have trouble clearing every battle they come across in Lumiose, which is why the Z-A Royale includes Bonus Cards. Tasks like “Sneak up on an opponent using only Flying-type moves,” or “Only defeat opponents with a higher rank than you,” offer bonus points that can help the protagonist get to the next rank more quickly. It remains engaging and exciting almost every time dusk falls over the city, whether the player is participating in the Royale or just trying to get on with whichever side quest they’re preoccupied with. A Walkable Open World Z-A follows the tradition set by Arceus and continued by Scarlet and Violet by being another open world game, but its approach to the genre differs from the industry standard in one significant way — traversal. In many open world games, Pokémon included, the protagonist gains different modes of traversal as they go along. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild , Link can paraglide and ride a horse. In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 , Peter Parker and Miles Morales can run, swing, or wind-glide through New York. In Legends: Z-A , the only way to get around (other than fast travel) is to walk. Lumiose City is self-contained but doesn’t provide much reason to explore on foot. Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Being set in a single city means that the world isn’t so expansive that it would be a massive chore to walk everywhere, and Game Freak’s intention is for the player to get distracted on their way by a side quest or an item or a Pokémon to catch. As underwhelming Lumiose ends up being when measured against the expectation of a bustling metropolis like that of Pokémon Black and White’ s Castelia City, there is never a shortage of things to do in between main missions. However, with the load times being as short as they are on Switch 2 , it always feels more convenient to fast-travel past them, which is a failure of open world design. Fast travel is an option in Marvel’s Spider-Man , but nobody wants to miss out on how good it feels to swing through New York, even if their destination is on the other side of the map. The visceral feeling of it is what puts gamers in the shoes of the main character, clicking a button and appearing in a different region can break the immersion. The greatest asset of Z-A ’s open world are the Wild Zones, areas where the untamed Pokémon of Lumiose are cornered off in an attempt to craft a city where both species can co-exist. Wild Zones are time sinks, places where hours can be drained away, their greatness owed to a mechanic ripped straight from Arceus where catching Pokémon feels like landing consecutive headshots in Call of Duty . The same trigger the player would use to shoot a gun is used to throw Poké Balls at unsuspecting monsters, and there’s never been a mechanic in a Pokémon game that feels as immersive. It’s not unique to Z-A , but the game is stronger for including it. Wild Zones are the only areas where Pokémon can be caught naturally (by pelting them in the head). Nintendo; The Pokémon Company Many of Z-A ’s weaker moments have to do with its visuals, something the series has never gotten right since going 3D. While Arceus was a cool interpretation of an ancient world, shooting for a grainy, chalky style, Z-A has no real visual flare to speak of. It’s a game that looks to present information rather than do anything truly inspiring. Z-A never drifts into the realm of unbearable bugs as Scarlet and Violet did (on Switch 2 anyway), the worst offenders being the odd jittery animation in the distance and some noticeable pop-in. The lack of voice acting is another old problem that rears its head here, cut scenes depict characters awkwardly flapping their mouths to complete silence, robbing the plot of whatever drama it has. Nintendo fans have gotten used to the company’s other flagship franchises like Mario , Zelda , and Donkey Kong reaching euphoric heights during the Switch era and are looking to Game Freak to deliver the same. There’s an expectation that a cash magnet as large as Pokémon could invest more in making bolder and more exciting games, but that popularity is its prison. Pokémon ’s power comes from constantly being in the zeitgeist with a new product out regularly, conditions anathema to innovation. Evolution is incremental and Legends: Z-A is as significant as those increments can be within the confines of Game Freak’s condensed release schedule. It builds an exciting new battle system, maintains a dynamic gameplay loop and expands the lore around a beloved part of the universe. This will be enough to top the eshop charts, sell out stores and recover some of the reputation damage from Scarlet and Violet’ s botched launch. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Game Freak is capable of delivering a complete package. At this point, the Pokémon franchise remains one still desperately in need of saving.

c3a13f598a96,Barack Obama Offers Marc Maron Political and Professional Advice on ‘WTF’ Finale,,"Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron’s last interview. Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close. As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world , both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what’s going on in me, how am I reacting to what’s going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we’re living in, as frightening as it is, with what’s happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what’s going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.” While Obama came to Maron’s house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration. “We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don’t use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What’s required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that’s not who we are. That’s not our idea of America.’” Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don’t rush into what the next thing is.” He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn’t get everything done that I wanted; it wasn’t always exactly how I planned it, but there’s a body of work there that I’m proud of.’” Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who’d helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who’d passed away. “Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/barack-obama-wtf-last-episode-barack-obama-interview-1235445889,Entertainment,the guardians,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2188444363.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-13T14:15:45+00:00,c18ffbcd0bbf7d5f60474b90f79e74c001c7ba40
b48bea4c9b21,7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’,,"7 Podcasts to Listen to After Watching ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story’ From deep dives into the notorious killer to explorations of Psycho and the Holocaust, learn the real history behind Ryan Murphy’s Netflix hit Producer Ryan Murphy loves to blur the line between fact and fiction , and there’s no shortage of that in his most recent entry, Monster: The Ed Gein Story . Ostensibly, the eight-part Netflix show is about Gein (played by Charlie Hunnam), a small-town Wisconsin farmer who was discovered in 1957 to have killed at least two women, grave-robbed several others, and used their remains to make grotesque clothing and decor for his home. His story became national news, and even after he was sent to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life, it inspired young writers and filmmakers to create the archetype for modern horror: the monster hidden among us. In Monster , Murphy explores this idea by including dramatized scenes of the making of some of these films, including Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs . He also includes the fantasies Gein might have had about Ilse Koch, a Nazi who was accused of using the skin of her death camp victims to make lampshades and bind books. And like any good true crime series, the show leaves viewers wanting to know more. So, instead of spending hours scrolling and searching the web, we’ve curated seven podcasts that delve into the stories explored in Monster: The Ed Gein Story. The Compendium Podcast: Ed Gein: Monster, Murderer, and the Real Story Behind Hollywood’s Nightmares For a story like that of Ed Gein, whose crimes have become so deeply ingrained in American culture that they can sometimes be hard to see, it’s beneficial to have an outsider’s perspective. The Compendium Podcast is a little newer than a lot of the podcasts on this list — it launched in 2023 — but it’s done a good job establishing itself among a growing number of nerdy British buddy podcasts (check out The Rest Is History if you want the OG) by publishing well researched deep dives on everything from Ocean Gate and Heavens Gate to Princess Diana and Roald Dahl. In this episode, co-host Adam Cox walks the listener through the story, while co-host Kyle Risi offers reactions on Gein, his crimes, and the films he inspired. Last Podcast on the Left: Ed Gein Last Podcast on the Left is one of the longest-running comedy-true crime shows out there (quite possibly the only one). The hosts’ casual rapport can sometimes feel at odds with the seriousness of the crimes that they’re discussing, but the schtick of the show — one friend explaining a crime to a group of friends, a now-common premise they helped establish back in 2011 — works well with a crime like Gein’s, where there’s so much myth and rumor to discuss. Some points in this three-part series can feel a little dated (it was made in 2015, after all), but overall, it’s a detailed, deep dive into a complicated subject made by a group of podcasters at the top of their game. You’re Wrong About: Ed Gein and Slasher Movies For this episode of the excellent series You’re Wrong About , co-hosts Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes not only give a nice dive into Gein’s story, but use it as a jumping-off point to discuss horror cinema. Going down the rabbit hole on topics like America’s mid-century obsession with Freud, how 1970s horror films reflected changing opinions of the Vietnam War, and the transphobic message at the heart of Silence of the Lambs , it opens up new lines of thought in Monster ’s other story: that of Gein’s affect on American art. (If you’re curious about the themes explored in Monster ’s final episode, you might also check out Y ou’re Wrong About: Mindhunting where Marshall dives into the world of criminal profiling.) Unspooled: Psycho Unspooled , hosted by actor Paul Scheer ( The League, Black Monday ) and L.A. Times film critic Amy Nicholson, launched in 2018, initially working its way through the American Film Institute’s 100 best films of all time. Though they’ve long since branched out, on that original list was Psycho , clocking in at number 14. In this episode, Scheer and Nicholson only briefly touch on Gein himself, instead focusing more on a critical exploration of the film. But their discussions of the film — along with an interview with Alexandre O. Philippe, director of 78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene , a documentary entirely about that cinematic murder — reveal how important this work was in the history of film. Inside Psycho Wonder’s eight-part series Inside Psycho, which came out in 2017, follows the formula of a lot of that podcast production company’s early shows: Told chronologically, with a cinematic, omnipotent perspective, it goes through the production of the film, from inspiration through its effect on Psycho director Alfred Hitchcock’s life and career. Although only the first episode focuses on Gein himself, the podcast delves into the nitty-gritty of how writer Robert Bloch used his knowledge of the case to write his novel, Psycho , and the adaptation took on Hitchcock and the film’s star, Anthony Perkins. Murphy took a lot of liberties in his dramatization of this in Monster , but this podcast gets closer to the truth. The Holocaust History Podcast: The Trials of Ilse Koch with Tomaz Jardim Hosted by historian Dr. Waitman Wade Beorn, The Holocaust History Podcast is a serious and sobering look at the Nazi regime during World War II. In this episode, he sits down with fellow historian Dr. Tomaz Jardim, author of Ilse Koch on Trial: Making the ‘Bitch of Buchenwald,’ to separate truth from fiction around this larger-than-life Nazi villain. While they take care to remind the listener that Koch was a full-blown Nazi who was morally complicit in the atrocities, they get past the layers of the caricature she became after the war, particularly the allegations that she used the skin of Jewish victims to make lampshades and bind books. That cartoonish figure is what Gein would have read about — and what Murphy shows in Monster — but they show that hers was a more mundane evil, and one shared by many wives of the Nazis in power. Morbid: Ed Gein What’s a podcast list without a couple of women who call their beloved fans “Weirdos” and chat about true crime? Sisters Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley host this long-running podcast, breaking Gein’s story into three parts: His life and upbringing (they have particularly harsh words for his mom); his crimes and capture; and his life after conviction and legacy. Unlike some other chatty podcast series, Urquhart and Kelley go through the story with empathy and care, and often cite their sources. Like many of the podcasts on this list, they rely heavily on Harold Schechter’s 1989 book Deviant: The Shocking and True Story of Ed Gein, the Original Psycho .",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/monster-ed-gein-podcast-1235444428,Entertainment,the guardians,Elisabeth Garber-Paul,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monster__The_Ed_Gein_Story.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T15:00:00+00:00,3fdddc23f3e0caacb92bcea4c8dbb8e43dab054a
38a180547215,The 20 Best NES Games of All Time,,"The 20 Best NES Games of All Time From duck and vampire hunts to boxing and football sims, these are the titles that made the Nintendo Entertainment System legendary It was in October of 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System first hit North America, with an initial test run of 100,000 units being sold exclusively in New York City. Following the post-Atari video game market crash of 1983, no one was sure if there’d even be an appetite for yet another new digital toy to connect to the TV. But after the massive reception to the device and launch titles like Baseball and Duck Hunt , the potential was clear. It was a new era of gaming, and the Japanese company Nintendo was leading the charge. Within that first month, Super Mario Bros. also arrived, later becoming a pack-in title for the nationwide release of the NES the following year. With its killer app firmly established, the NES would begin its pop culture takeover that lasted well into the Nineties, amounting to a nearly 62 million units sold across all regions — a success so big, it’s credited with saving the home console market altogether. And although it was powerful enough for its time and introduced several hardware gimmicks (the NES Zapper is a stroke of genius), the NES’ legacy will always be defined by its downright ludicrous library of software. On top of its own first-party games like Mario , Metroid , and The Legend of Zelda , the OG Nintendo console was home to fledgling franchises from external partners like Konami, Capcom, and Tecmo — all of whom worked symbiotically (and at times antagonistically) with the Big N. Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Ninja Gaiden ; so many of today’s gaming dynasties began on the NES. It can be tough to narrow down which of the console’s games are its best. While nostalgia plays a factor, it’s just a fact that much of its lineup feels dated to play today. But looking back, there’s an astonishing number of NES releases that hold up to modern standards, and even the ones that may feel rough around the edges retain an undeniable impact. A bona fide classic can always be measured by how much you love it, even when it’s a pain in the ass to play. So, from groundbreaking platformers to slick shooters, these are the best NES games of all time. ‘Tecmo Super Bowl’ Image Credit: Tecmo Although most folks love RPGs or action-packed shooters, it’s impossible to understate the impact of sport games as a cultural juggernaut. There’s just something spectacular about bridging the gap between the cult of IRL sports with playable fantasy. The NES arrived with a handful of big ones like the bluntly named Baseball and Tennis , but 1989’s Tecmo Bowl brought it to another level. The first console game to officially strike a licensing agreement with the NFL Players Association, Tecmo’s sports sim let players control real athletes like Jerry Rice and Joe Montana to compete in the living room. Its sequel, Tecmo Super Bowl, upped the ante by also licensing the official team names, making for the most authentic football experience on the NES. Tecmo Super Bowl may feel rudimentary now, but the progenitor to franchises like Madden continued to be popular for decades thanks to an obsessive modding community that updated the game’s roster each season to give it an exponential afterlife. ‘Bionic Commando’ Image Credit: Capcom A key part of platforming games is the ability to jump, but Capcom’s Bionic Commando offers an alternative by letting players swing like Spider-Man using the protagonist’s robot arm. The game is challenging — especially during the learning curve of mastering the mechanics of grabbing, swinging, and climbing — but once it clicks, there’s few titles quite like it. Due to the angles required by the swinging system, Bionic Commando was one of the first games to emphasize eight-way aiming, although it’s limited to the grapple feature. Later entries would include the ability to shoot more directions and (thankfully) extend the arm mid-air, but the original remains a feat of ingenuity at a time when action-platformers were cementing their foundations. In a crowded field, Bionic Commando stands apart. ‘Blaster Master’ Image Credit: Sunsoft One of gaming’s greatest blessings is just how stupid a story can be as justification for the action. Sunsoft’s Blaster Master opens with a cinematic sequence that depicts a young man named Jason, whose pet frog breaks free and dives into a hole in the ground. Obviously, Jason follows and discovers a giant battle tank — which he immediately commandeers to slay a race of subterranean mutants. After its bizarre setup, Blaster Master quickly sets into one of the most kinetic experiences ever developed for the NES. Jason’s tank is extremely agile, allowing players to move quickly, jump nimbly, and aim freely in multiple directions. Each of its eight labyrinthine levels are dense with areas to explore, and the action remains constant. The mobile mech controls of Blaster Master feel so smooth, you’d almost be convinced they’re from a later era, feeling like the natural predecessor to contemporary mech-suit series like Armored Core . ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project’ Image Credit: Konami Although arcades were the true home of early beat ‘em ups, early consoles like the NES had their fair share too. One such gem was the NES-exclusive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project , which arrived in 1991 just when turtle mania was at its apex. With controls based on the previous entry, which itself was built off the coin-up arcade version of TMNT , The Manhattan Project is a mechanically streamlined gauntlet of ass-kicking. The game can be played solo or as a pair and features the ability to toggle on and off friendly fire (depending on how much you want to agitate your siblings). Like other TMNT games, each level is filled with an array of baddies from the animated series like Bebop and Rocksteady, as well as many iterations of Foot Clan soldiers, all of which have unique abilities based on their colors. While its SNES sequel, Turtles in Time may be heralded as the best in the series, The Manhattan Project is a high point for NES-era beat ‘em ups. ‘Excitebike’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the best-selling games for the NES, Excitebike has one hell of a legacy. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto for its 1984 Japanese release, the motocross racing game wasn’t just extremely well-designed in its own right, but its systems would influence other titles across genres for generations. Most directly, its 2D side-scrolling controls were adapted for Super Mario Bros ., giving the lead character his trademark inertia-building energy while running and jumping. Later on, its DNA could be felt in everything from Wave Race 64 to Flappy Bird , where strategically holding a button to gain altitude and angling the correct pitch for landing is key. But even if it hadn’t been so influential, Excitebike would still just be a damned fun game that holds up exceptionally well today. Dodging between lanes and correcting timing a jump boost is exhilarating, and the desire to best your own time always warrants another lap. ‘Super Dodge Ball’ Image Credit: CSG Imagesoft Long before the Ben Stiller movie introduced the idea of dodging a wrench as training for dodgeball, this spin-off of the River City game series made the gym class sport into a brutal proposition. Players control a six-man squad of ballers, with three populating the infield and another three surrounding the opposing team on the fringes of the court. Balls can be thrown plainly, but by initiating a sprint and properly timing the pitch, a superpowered special beans the opponent hard enough to propel them into the invisible walls. Like many games of the era, the visuals are janky. There’s almost never a moment when one or more characters are fully visible, constantly flickering and clipping in and out of frame. Yet the gameplay is smooth, precise, and surprisingly deep in its complexity. Traveling the world to conquer the dodgeball league is fun, but the real treat is the “bean ball” mode that boils the action down to a six-man free-for-all in a schoolyard where there are no rules or borders — only the ball and your killer instinct. ‘StarTropics’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the few titles developed for the NES to never be released in Japan, StarTropics is a strange mash-up of RPG exploration and dungeon-crawling that feels like multiple games blended into one. The story follows a 15-year-old named Mike Jones who is visiting his archaeologist uncle on a tropical island. After his uncle goes missing, Mike must follow the clues gleaned from conversations with various townspeople that lead into different multi-level dungeons filled with puzzles to solve and creatures to beat with his trusty yo-yo and baseball-inspired kit. At times, it feels like Zelda , with shades of Final Fantasy , but the game oddly shares much of its DNA with the Japanese-only release, Mother (1989), which also followed a boy armed with a yo-yo and baseball bat for a fantasy adventure. StarTropics ultimately spawned just one sequel, but its genre-mixing premise and lush environments would make for a great modern revival, should Nintendo be so inclined. ‘R.C. Pro-Am’ Image Credit: Rare You’d think that the best racing game on the NES would involve high-power motorcycles or spaceships, but in truth, all that’s needed is a set of remote-controlled cars. Developed by Rare well before they reinvented Donkey Kong on the SNES , R.C. Pro-Am is an inventive take on top-down racing that wringed every ounce of power out of its console for finely tuned controls and solid physics. The game is played from a three-quarter perspective rather than from the rear of the cars, making it possible to turn in a full 360 degrees — often by mistake. The POV is distinct, forcing you to focus on the track’s many curves and anticipate the positioning needed, but it’s generous in how easily one can course correct a miscalculation. Instead of leaning into speed or hazards on the horizon, the rally vibe of Pro-Am offer a different way to race that’s surprisingly enthralling despite its quaintness. ‘Duck Hunt’ Image Credit: Nintendo Duck Hunt needs little introduction. One of the key launch titles for the NES’ North American market, its appeal is obvious. Utilizing the Zapper peripheral, it brought shooting gallery games from arcades and bars to people’s homes, and became a sensation so big, it was paired with Super Mario Bros. in a single cartridge as the must-have Nintendo games for many years. Its concept is simple: players aim the handheld gun at their CRT screen (it unfortunately doesn’t work with modern flatscreens) and shoot either flying ducks or play pigeons round after round in carnival game fashion. It’s a lizard-brained kind of pleasure, and is enjoyable at any skill level — although children of the Eighties likely have memories of being scolded for sitting too close to the TV. (Not cheating!) ‘Life Force’ Image Credit: Konami A spin-off of the Gradius series, Life Force (called Salamander in Japan) is a classic side-scrolling spaceship shooter where players must battle waves of flying baddies and constant environmental hazards, powering themselves up with pick-ups along the way. While Gradius itself is the bigger name and would be worthy of inclusion on any list, Life Force is the superior choice for numerous reasons. Firstly, the game is more forgiving, allowing players to bounce back from death right where they fell rather than being sent back to an arbitrary checkpoint. Secondly, its power-up system is streamlined, and allows multiple items to be combined to create an insane arsenal. Fully playable in co-op, Life Force is one of the best two-person games available for the NES. ‘Punch-Out!!’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of the most instantly recognizable names from the NES era, Punch-Out!! has seen multiple re-releases that will quickly pinpoint when someone picked up the game. The 1987 version featured then-World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson as its final boss, with a later 1990 release swapping out the at-times problematic (and pricey to license) real-life figure for the fictional creation, Mr. Dream. Adapted from Nintendo’s own arcade series, Punch-Out!! is arguably the best boxing game ever made. While it lacks the realism and depth of more contemporary franchises, its emphasis on rhythm and learning an opponent’s weakness was brilliant for the time. Aside from the entry-level fighter Glass Joe, bouts demand a deft balance of stamina management and reading each person’s tells, with specific behavior and character animations indicating when it’s time to dodge or strike, and in which direction. Endlessly playable, it’s a franchise that’s come and gone throughout Nintendo’s history, and there’s never a bad time to bring it back. ‘Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation’ Image Credit: Square Enix The NES as a platform was ground zero for numerous iconic roleplaying games like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem , but the best of the bunch was Dragon Warrior ( Dragon Quest in Japan). The Americanized title has fallen by the wayside in recent years as Dragon Quest became more popular globally, and the third entry is considered by many to be the essential starting point. Featuring artwork from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama , and RPG mechanics that will be familiar to fans of tabletop and video games of all eras, Dragon Quest III may look visually modest, but it plays extremely well. With a sprawling open world that allows for non-linear exploration, a heavily detailed class system that lets new recruits choose their abilities, and an epic fantasy narrative, Dragon Quest III is the definitive NES RPG. ‘Contra’ Image Credit: Konami One look at Contra ’s box art will tell you that it’s going for peak late-Eighties machismo. Equal parts Rambo , Predator , and Aliens , the run and gun side-scrolling shooter pits players as meathead commandos Bill Rizer or Lance Bean (or both in co-op) on a jungle mission to wipe out an alien army. Some stages scroll left-to-right while others move vertically, but the game’s greatest strength is its kinetic set pieces where big enemies arrive at scripted intervals to fuck things up. While many shooters of the era can feel clunky, Contra remains slick, with players easily able to drop between different layers of each level and drop prone to dodge incoming projectiles. Its weapons upgrade system is straightforward, requiring just simple item pickups to suddenly give the commandos spinning flamethrowers and big-balled shotgun blasts. Even though it’s been iterated on countless times, the original Contra is the ultimate form of dumb fun. ‘Metroid’ Image Credit: Nintendo Although Nintendo’s early work was mostly rooted in cheery cartoon aesthetics, one game stood out as something decidedly darker. Heavily influenced by Ridley Scott’s Alien , Metroid dropped players into a desolate world with little direction and even less hope. Players take on the role of Samus Aran, a lethal bounty hunter on the trail of a faction of space pirates who are harboring a mysterious biological weapon (spoiler: it’s a metroid!). Although it might feel like a chore to play for many today, the original Metroid popularized a dizzying amount of video game mechanics and tropes that’re currently employed in games like Hollow Knight and even 3D series like Elden Ring . Samus starts extremely weak, with minimal abilities to traverse the mazelike terrain. Inching along chamber-by-chamber (and hopefully drawing a map), players must find new tools that will open up blocked paths in older areas. While its SNES sequel would perfect these ideas, the first game is no slouch, and is every bit worth revisiting, if only to see an early vision of gaming’s present. ‘Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse’ Image Credit: Konami It’s an odd trend in the NES era where the third entry of certain franchises ends up being chronologically a prequel, as is the case with Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse . While the second game in the series leaned more heavily into RPG elements, Dracula’s Curse reverted to a more straightforward action-heavy approach, letting players explore multiple branching paths but always solving problems with a simple crack of the whip. A first for the series, the game stars multiple protagonists that can be swapped on the fly: vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, sorceress Sypha Belnades, pirate Grant Danasty, and Alucard — the dhampir son of Dracula himself. With a rich gothic atmosphere and moody soundtrack, Castlevania III is among the most aesthetically pleasing titles for the NES, and one of the most rewarding to play. Its story was recently adapted into Netflix’s Castlevania anime series, driving many to go back to explore its 8-bit origins. ‘Ninja Gaiden’ Image Credit: Koei Tecmo During the Seventies and Eighties, ninjas were all the rage. Obviously, the shadowy warriors would inspire waves of video games, among the best of which was the Ninja Gaiden series. Tecmo’s side-scrolling action series was acclaimed at the time for its then-cutting edge cinematic cutscenes, which told the narrative in animated sequences preceding each stage. In action, the game’s action is razor-sharp and its platforming is innovative, letting players cling to walls and bounce between tiers with the agility of a shinobi. Compared to its contemporaries, Ninja Gaiden ’s combat is surgical, allowing the hero Ryu to strike down foes with a single slice, although they continually regenerate and can become quickly overwhelming. It can be extremely tough to best all 20 levels, but for those up to the challenge, Ninja Gaiden is a perfect slice of retro action gaming. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Image Credit: Nintendo One of Nintendo’s most prolific franchises, The Legend of Zelda has a long history of delivering some of the greatest games of all time . But it all began with the NES original, which presented many players with their first experience with a truly open world to explore. Starring the elf-eared hero Link, the game is all about discovery as users trek through the various biomes of Hyrule, stumbling across dungeons and secret chambers that house crucial items to reach new areas and combat enemies. The game’s open-ended environment is miraculous given the limitations of the NES, but it begins to make sense once players figure out the world’s grid-like regions. For many, the only way to solve its mysteries was to use a physical map, scribbling solutions, theories, and X’s to mark each critical spot. The NES was home to a multitude of grandiose fantasy adventures, but none were as legendary as Zelda . ‘Super Mario Bros.’ Image Credit: Nintendo There will never be another game like the first Super Mario Bros . While the NES debuted with a full lineup of bangers, the 1985 platformer blew the lid off the industry when it arrived, quickly being retrofitted as the pack-in title that warranted the purchase of the console itself. It was the Nintendo game, and in many ways, it still is. Designed by the maestro behind most of the company’s early classics, Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Bros. plucked the playable hero from 1981’s Donkey Kong arcade game and gave him a complete overhaul. Firstly, he got a name (Mario!), as well as a brother (Luigi!), but most importantly, he gained the distinct ability to run and jump with extreme precision. Over the years, most players have completely memorized the various stages of the game to the point where you can see it with eyes closed, but it’s to the game’s credit that even if you (somehow) never tried it, it’s insanely easy to learn. Forty years after its release, Super Mario Bros . plays like a dream, with an incredible sense of momentum and tight control. And on top of inspiring thousands of games throughout decades, it almost singlehandedly saved gaming as the crown jewel of a console whose phenomenal popularity reinvigorated the industry. ‘Mega Man 2’ Image Credit: Capcom There’s something to be said for the value of player choice, and Capcom’s Mega Man series is built on the simple conceit of letting people pick how they want to tackle its challenges. At the start of each attempt, you’re presented with a list of eight levels to choose from, each with their own environmental theme and a special boss at the end. The hitch is that each of the bad guys can be more easily thwarted by another one’s abilities (which Mega Man himself gains after killing them). Which way do you start? What’s the ideal flowchart for beating them all? Sometimes, it just boils down to which ones you’re able to defeat. Mega Man 2 is the series’ best installment, famously perfecting the run and gun gameplay introduced by its predecessor while improving the level design. If Mario lets players rely on twitchy response time and frequently forgiving physics, Mega Man is all about methodical progression. Each level introduces entirely new elements, like conveyer belts of conflicting speeds and opposite trajectories that demand measured timing to traverse while being assailed by robots. The arc of the game is deeply memorable, a Jacob’s Ladder-like ascension through all levels into the endgame, which consists of a sequence of linear stages plus a second round with every one of the previous bosses. It’s a grueling gauntlet, but Mega Man 2 lives at the nexus of stellar action and platforming perfection. ‘Super Mario Bros. 3’ Image Credit: Nintendo How Nintendo managed to one-up its flagship title remains a marvel. The first attempt to create direct sequel to Super Mario Bros. was famously a bust. While the Japanese attempt mostly amounted to a more difficult expansion ( The Lost Levels ), the American one was literally a reskin of an entirely different game with the newly popular characters swapped in. Neither hit the mark, and for the third installment, Nintendo needed to think bigger. Super Mario Bros. 3 took everything the original did so well and exponentially upped the ante. Its levels are compact, dense with increasingly complex physical puzzles of dexterity whose solutions are taught organically in motion. Its visuals are lively; the many regions of the Mushroom Kingdom all feel distinct and packed to the brim with personality. The power-ups, from the Fire Flower to the Tanooki Suit, all give players an edge without making them helpless by losing them. While the 1985 game introduced the characters and world, it was Super Mario Bros 3. that cemented countless staples of the franchise that continue today. The world map lets players choose which routes to take between levels and provided bonus stages to hoarding items. The addition of new powerups let Mario take to the sky with the Super Leaf or throw projectiles in the Hammer Suit. Each of Bowser’s children, the Koopalings, provided a different threat as regional bosses rather than being different flavors of the same old thing. Generations later, gaming doesn’t get much better than Super Mario Bros. 3 . Despite its vintage, it’s a guaranteed joy to pick up and play, no matter how many times you’ve beat it. Although the NES would continue getting new releases well into the early Nineties, it ultimately peaked here. Super Mario Bros. 3 is the embodiment of everything that makes a Nintendo game great, and is easily the best of what the era had to offer.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming-lists/best-nes-games-of-all-time-1235442260,Entertainment,the guardians,Christopher Cruz,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NES_2-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-12T14:00:00+00:00,2452de7d2b8ba8741343c656008e604d6fd0529c
cd22c222aff4,"There’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket. For Some Young Men, It’s a Near-Fatal Gamble",,"F or Andrew Douglas, bottom was seven cops banging on the door of his apartment. He’d sharpened the knife “good,” filled the bathtub with water, and downed a vial of Coumadin to bleed out faster. Had his dad not sensed something and dialed 911, Andrew, a star baseball player turned gambling addict in college, would have quietly checked out at age 33, leaving his twin infant sons, his guilt-crippled parents, and many thousands of dollars in gambling debts behind. For Jonah, bottom wasn’t failing out of college and mulling suicide. Nor was it the month in a Florida rehab, where, for some fool reason, they let him have his cellphone and he bet money he’d stolen from family on four-legged parlay bets. (More on parlays later.) No, for Jonah, a lacrosse player at a powerhouse program, bottom was crossing the last bridge of honor: trading inside info with players at other schools to cover the over/under on games they bet. For the seven mostly young men sitting around this table, bottom was a grave of their own digging — a hole so deep that their cries for help went unheard. “My thoughts were too crazy, I thought that no one would get them,” says Marcus, a mid-twentysomething dressed like a gamer: black glasses, high-top Chucks, and a Playskool-colored sweatshirt. At his bottom, he was staring out the window of his apartment, weighing whether a fall from five flights up would kill or merely maim him. “I got to where suicide sounded sane.” (Excepting Andrew, above, the gamblers in this story spoke in exchange for anonymity.) We’re lunching at a sports bar in a Philadelphia suburb, picking at taste-free wings and waffle fries. It’s a curious place to bring a group of recovering gamblers, but the man at the head of the table has his reasons. Harry Levant has always been a rower against the river: a former criminal-defense attorney who lost his license, and nearly lost his life, to his own gambling jones a decade back; a second-chance crusader and addictions counselor who mainly treats folks gutted by gambling disorders; and a peripatetic opponent of the online gambling behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel , and the other sports-betting operators (hereafter, SBOs). Forty weeks a year, Levant’s somewhere in the air, lecturing state legislators and groups of physicians about the betting apps’ ploys and snares, as well as the harms he says they’ve levied on Gen Z males. That grail of Levant’s reads lonely and self-devouring: the mania of the gambler repurposed for public service. “Every addictive product has regulations,” says Levant. “Why is this the only one without them?” As his clients tell their stories, a loose narrative hangs together. With an exception here and there, most of these guys started gambling as teens, playing lunchroom hold-em and NFL parlays for a buck or two a throw. Then they got to college, rooming and running with older kids. Here, suddenly, everyone seemed to be in action, be it betting stupid sums on esports soccer or throwing 15 bucks at a five-legged parlay that paid out 20 to one but rarely cashed. (A parlay is a combo bet on two or more outcomes; to collect, you must win each outcome, or “leg.” Should you hit on four legs but miss the fifth, you lose whatever money you put down. Oh, and the odds of winning that five-legged parlay? Less than five percent.) Hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to gambling debts, Andrew Douglas says nurses turned on the NBA Finals and handed him his phone: “I gambled away my last $100.” The portals and drivers for much of this action were the giant sports-bet apps. On the party-colored killing floor of online gambling, FanDuel and DraftKings own most of the take, cornering 80 percent of the mobile bet market in this country. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion; by 2028, we’ll have bet — and lost — a trillion dollars since 2018. That was the year the Supreme Court reversed a federal ban on legalized gambling, freeing each state to partner with Big Sports Bet and feed their residents, especially the young ones, to the wolves. FanDuel and DraftKings wasted no time. They’d spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and the better part of a decade, carpet-bombing the airwaves with ads. Now, they paid kings’ ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and branding, and partnered with, or bought up, AI firms to help target their users’ browsing habits, favorite teams, and sports. “DraftKings, for one, bought SimpleBet, the biggest AI firm in this space, to turn data into in-game microbets,” says Levant. “Then they tracked and used their customers’ data to determine which of them preferred making constant, nonstop bets — and pushed those bets their way.” Bombarded by promos for FanDuel and DraftKings — “Get a $1,000 deposit bonus!” reads one DraftKings blast — underage boys pressed their parents to open accounts, often linked to dad’s ID and banking info, critics claim. Or they surreptitiously opened accounts without their parents’ knowledge, as teens have done with verboten vices since the dawn of time. “Young guys have always bonded around sports; it’s wired into their pack behavior,” says Levant. “What the apps do is monetize that pack behavior: Guys bond over sports bets, not sports, now.” Reached for comment on the matter, DraftKings and FanDuel pushed back on the contention that underage gambling is rampant on their apps, pointing to the safeguards they have in place. “DraftKings is committed to providing a legal, regulated, and responsible gaming environment for adults,” wrote a spokesperson for the company. “We employ advanced Know Your Customer (KYC) technology, relied on by the financial industry and law enforcement, to verify the age of our customers. Any use of our platform by minors violates both our Terms of Use and the law, and we actively monitor to detect and report this prohibited activity.” It bears noting that neither SBO agreed to on-the-record interviews for this piece. Instead, they responded with written statements, like the one from FanDuel, as follows: “As a legal, licensed and regulated operator, we ​have focused on the importance of educating college students on the risks associated with gambling. Notably, recovered problem gambler and national TV host Craig Carton brings lived experience and well-documented struggles with gambling to campuses through the FanDuel Responsible Gaming College Tour. Additionally, we have extended our education efforts to reach families by creating the Trusted Voices parent portal which provides tools and resources to talk to young people about gambling, associated risks, how to recognize warning signs and where to go for support.” To be clear, most adults who gamble on sports do so as a harmless time suck, a way to zest their weekend football viewing. And  countless teens put 10 spots on ballgames without getting dragged into addiction . “There are kids with a healthy relationship to money who can gamble casually on sports,” says Jody Bechtold, the CEO and founder of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh and a distinguished lecturer on gambling addiction. “But there are lots of other kids wired differently these days — high anxiety, ADHD, over-immersion in video games — who’re at much higher risk of addiction.” That’s especially so for kids “from affluent families who never learned the value of a dollar. Money’s supposed to hurt when you lose it,” but they were raised on “all things cashless: Venmo, PayPal, you name it.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports — though simple math tells us that the large majority of those bettors likely wouldn’t have been of legal age to do so. Worse, many engaged in a particularly rash form of gaming, making high-speed wagers on in-game action — a pernicious new product called microbetting. Last year, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average. And who on campus is qualified to treat this gusher of gambling addictions? Essentially no one, per the experts I talked to. “Colleges aren’t set up to treat [six percent] of their students,” says Jim Lange, the executive director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Misuse Prevention and Recovery at Ohio State University. “That isn’t our business model, and never will be.” He added that most schools don’t even know they have a problem: Gambling is scarcely mentioned in the National Collegiate Health Assessment, the standard tool used by schools to track drug and alcohol misuse by students. None of those stats is news to the young men sitting at this table. “When I owed money to every kid I knew and was betting on Chinese ping-pong at 4 a.m., I tried going for counseling on campus,” says Marcus, the gamer kid. “As I’m talking to the counselor, she’s pulling a manual off the shelf, looking up [the definition of] ‘problem gambling.’” FanDuel and DraftKings have paid king’s ransoms to each of the major sports leagues in exchange for their data and partnered with AI firms to help target users’ habits. Ron Vesely/Getty Images “In the hospital, where I was hooked up to a bunch of IVs [after his failed suicide bid], they turned the NBA Finals on and gave me my phone; I gambled away my last $100,” says Andrew, the ex-baseball player. Things were no better during his 30-day stay at an addiction clinic in Florida. “They didn’t touch on gambling at all.” So, too, for Jonah, the former lacrosse player, sent to an out-of-state facility at 21. “This place knew nothing about gambling addiction. They gave us two hours of phone time a day, and I set up a VPN to bet in Philly.” I hear a collective intake of breath as Jonah wraps his story. For all the suffering at this table, there’s a redemptive kinship as well, and a recognition that feels like rescue. The six percent of college kids who lose $500 or more in a day? “We used to be those kids,” says Marcus, to grunts and knowing head nods. “This is what it looks like, five years later.” Thousands of dollars stolen from a doting grandma. A bride empaupered months after her wedding. Betrayals so base they can’t be spoken to other people — but with this group, there are no secrets or judgments; only gratitude for the chance to come clean. Eight years ago, Americans placed around $5 billion in sports bets. Last year, that number zoomed to nearly $150 billion “After all those months and years in the cold, here you’re among friends who know exactly what you’ve gone through,” says Levant. “And all I ask in return from these guys: Don’t make a bet today.” Andrew cuts in here to show me his phone. “Look at that top email, from Caesars,” he says. It reads, Your mystery bonus is here . “Four years since I shut down that app, they’re still tryna get their hooks in me.” “And that,” says Levant, “is why I chose this place.” He points to the flat-panels mounted above the tables, 50 or 60 sets tuned to Fox Sports 1 or the umpteenth rerun of “First Take.” Every last one of them posts a ticker at the bottom: Odds brought to you by either FanDuel or DraftKings. “This is what these guys have to live with,” says Levant. “They can’t run from sports or those fucking apps. All they can do is change their response.” A Caesars Sportsbook logo looms large over the scoreboard at Rate Field in Chicago. Patrick Gorski/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images MALIK BEASLEY, A SIZZLING SCORER and prime free agent, may never see the floor in another game. After nearly $60 million made in the NBA, he’s awash in debt and unwanted by teams after a federal DA poked through his gambling tabs. ( Recently cleared in that probe , he remains unsigned as basketball season approaches.) Emmanuel Clase is one of the best closers in baseball, but he won’t get to throw another pitch until the sport gets done scouring his prop-bet plays. Clase faces a lifetime ban if MLB can prove he engaged in spot-fixing, the practice of shading his own stat lines by intentionally sailing a slider over his catcher’s head. Jontay Porter could be headed to prison shortly: The NBA center copped to conspiracy to commit wire fraud recently for his part in a prop-bet ring. And Ippei Mizuhara is doing fed time already for stealing millions from his famous boss, Shohei Ohtani, to pay off gambling debts. If men who have everything can’t stop betting long enough to save their prized careers, how will we keep a generation of teens from taking a match to their futures? We find ourselves on the cusp of this disaster thanks in part to a petition brought in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Murphy and his predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to decriminalize wagers on sports in their state. They were suing to unleash a product so destructive that in 2013 the doctors and clinicians of the American Psychiatric Association added “gambling disorder” to the list of substance disorders in their revised standard text, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5. It was an extraordinary upgrade, says Levant, the first of its kind: warning readers of a “substance” they couldn’t smoke, shoot, or snort, but which was nonetheless “highly addictive” and “similar in nature to heroin, opioids, tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine.” “We reclassified gambling because it shared the symptomology of classic narcotic addiction, “ says Dr. Petros Levounis, past president of the APA. “We’re greatly concerned now because of the rise in sports betting. There’s a striking likeness to the tobacco and opioid industries — and there’s consensus among us that those industries committed crimes that resulted in suffering and death.” (Approached for comment, Murphy sent this boilerplate: “The Murphy Administration is concerned by the growing national epidemic of online sports-betting addiction, particularly among young men. What begins as occasional recreational betting too often spirals into financial instability, anxiety and depression, and high-risk habits. Our Administration is committed to mitigating the risks associated with problem gambling, including expanding treatment options and holding bad operators accountable.”) FanDuel and DraftKings have cornered 80 percent of the mobile sports-bet market in America. Rob Carr/Getty Images Harmful substances, such as alcohol and narcotics, are typically regulated and controlled. But when presented with what some experts call “the biggest public health threat since Big Tobacco,” SCOTUS killed the only law shielding Americans from the corporate bet sharks. That law, called PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), did precisely what its title proposed. It protected pro and college sports leagues from point-shave rings; kept the Mob (and enraged bettors) off the backs of the players; and put so much physical distance between gamblers and casinos that they couldn’t lose their shirts on a passing hunch. To be sure, problem gamblers found their way around it, opening accounts with offshore sportsbooks or a local guy-who-knew-a-guy. But the damage was contained to the vulnerable few, which is about the best you can hope for from a law. What followed, post-PASPA, was so predictable, you couldn’t have gotten odds for it at Vegas. A sanctimonious foe of sportsbooks for decades, the NFL immediately entered talks with FanDuel and DraftKings. For billions in betting revenue, the league leased those firms the rights to its stat packs, metrics, and branding. That proprietary data enabled the apps to launch a brand-new product: live, in-game wagers on practically anything that happened on field. No longer were kids forced to wait hours on an outcome; now, they could bet on every play and every player through AI-brokered props in real time. That phenomenon, called microbetting, forever changed gambling by turbo-boosting the speed of betting behaviors. The effect of microbetting, if not its intent, is to induce a fugue state that keeps users in action. “You lose track of time and space, and next thing you know, you’re betting Indian cricket at 4 a.m.,” says Marcus. “I don’t even know the rules of cricket. Those fuckin’ matches go on for three days!” Every major pro sports league followed football’s lead, selling their data for a slice of the sports-bet pie. The effect on problem gamblers was catastrophic. “I went from betting money lines on baseball games to betting the number of runs scored in every inning,” says Frankie, a client of Levant’s in his late twenties with a South Philly brogue and a shiny widow’s peak. “Any money left at the end of the night, I’m flipping to FanDuel’s casino. Then it’s slots and blackjack till I bust, and now I’m betting Chinese ping-pong at 3 a.m.” A year ago May, Frankie married his sweetheart in a grand Italian wedding. The guests sent them off with a pillowcase full of cash. Behind his wife’s back, Frankie lost all the cash, then defaulted on the mortgage for their house. “I didn’t know where to turn,” he says. “Suicide was my only option till I found Harry.” Two years ago, the NCAA published a study on the steep surge of gambling on college campuses. It found that 67 percent of students living on campus were betting on sports Those microbets and parlay packs that hooked Levant’s clients are the SBOs’ profit centers. How do we know this? Because the apps themselves say so: They’re the bets featured in their ads. Kevin Hart, Rob Gronkowski, Tom Brady, LeBron James: You can’t shut them up and make them go away when they’re touting props and parlays in every promo. Nor can you squelch their motormouthed peers on the pods and sports-bet shows: the Bill Simmonses and Charles Barkleys and Scott Van Pelts, who’ve merrily boarded the gravy train as “ambassadors” for the SBOs. (Approached for comment, Simmons, Barkley and Van Pelt declined to speak.) “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product,” says Levant. “They’re accepting enormous sums to push [that] addictive product on an increasingly younger audience.” AFTER THE FALL OF PASPA, states raced one another to the betting window, smelling 10-figure windfalls in new taxes. Thirty-nine states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico passed bills that legalized the sports-bet racket. The ensuing carnage was swift and savage. New callers flooded the toll-free hotlines at 1-800-GAMBLER, and frantically searched the web for help, googling “gambling addiction” online. The state of New Jersey saw a nearly 300 percent spike in hotline calls in the first five years of legal betting. (Around six percent of its residents now suffer from gambling disorders — or three times the national average, per a Rutgers survey .) In Connecticut, the number of hotline calls increased 200 percent in the first two years — and the crisis was most acute among young men. “Forty percent of those calls are coming from twentysomething males,” says Diana Goode, the executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, who likens the legalization of gambling to the opioid crisis. “It’s literally the same thing they did with pain pills. These companies hand out free samples [i.e., welcome bonuses] to get [young men] addicted to betting.” Gambling-addiction expert Jody Bechtold says young men are especially susceptible to the dangers of this culture because they’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images I put the obvious question to clinician after clinician: Why are young people, males in particular, so susceptible to sports-bet apps? Bechtold, the founder and director of the Better Institute in Pittsburgh, began with the mile-high view. “This generation was basically bred for addiction, [having been] raised on cellphones inches from their faces.” The feeds on those devices “disrupted their neural wiring,” leaving them anxious, impulsive, and susceptible to “stims that are quick and constant onscreen.” Their online childhoods also robbed them of life skills best learned by leaving the house. Fiscal savvy gained by working part-time jobs. Risk awareness from running the streets, and an acquired sense of consequences from actions. “When these kids go bust, time after time it’s the parents who bail them out,” says Bechtold. “Every family I deal with, I say, ‘Quit giving the kid money!’ And Mom says, ‘Oh, I’m not ready to do that yet.’” Bechtold says these things not to shame her clients, but to name the preconditions that make them targets. They’ve grown up immersed “in a stew of ads” from the Big Two betting apps; been chased across the web by their pings and promotions; and been told by the celebrities they trust most to think that betting’s how winners have fun. It normalizes gambling as “something cool to do with your friends,” she says. Now layer on the male-skewing lubricant of sports, and you’ve built “a mass addiction machine,” says Matt Gaskell, the clinical lead for the NHS Northern Gambling Service in England. “These companies engineered a product that exploits the reward pathways” of young brains. “The constant crackle of dopamine keeps them playing” — and then a big bump, equivalent to a “spike of heroin,” is triggered by “a win on their team.” Eventually, though, the wins and losses cease to matter. What keeps these kids in action is “that neurochemical feed that fires the desire centers in the brain.” Gaskell’s had a decade-plus jump on his peers: Britain legalized mobile sports bets in 2005. The fallout has been tragic. “We have an estimated one to two suicides a day in England, and many of the ones I know of are of young men from middle-class families with university training” he says. Rather than confront the SBOs by slapping limits on their ads and promos — “our kids see 1,600 gambling logos in a 90-minute [soccer] match onscreen,” says Gaskell — the British government lamely lists “gambling disorder” as an official cause of death. “This industry has captured our policymakers with its billions, as I expect it’s done with yours. So the warning from over here is, expect disaster.” EVER WONDER WHAT LIFE’S LIKE with a serpent on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to bet the Braves? For Andrew, the ex-third baseman in college, that forked-tongue enticer gave him no quarter, hissing Check the bonus! at 6 a.m. “Between the voice in my head and the texts from the sportsbooks, I wasn’t really sleeping a whole lot,” he says in his honey-maple drawl from the Carolinas. “Every night, I’d tell myself, ‘That’s your last bet.’ Then every morning, I’d get up, see the bonus on my phone, and bet double what I did the day before.” He’s calling from his flat in eastern Pennsylvania, a bachelor pad he’s put through the wringer. There are gashes in the walls he’s just getting around to fixing: holes he made throwing weights and plates after losing thousands of dollars in three hours. “I’ve never hit anyone in my life,” he says. “But I’ve got a hell of an arm.” Between September of 2020, when he moved up from Atlanta to join the mother of his unborn twins in Pennsylvania, and May of 2024, when he placed his last wager, he bet more than a million dollars, he says, on live, long-shot parlays and props. He’s not sure how much of that was lost on the apps, but concedes it was “a lot.” A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that betting on campus had surged to 75 percent — and that six percent of students were addicted to gambling, or nearly double the national average He says he stole cash from his parents on visits home to Greenville, and guilted them into stopgap loans he knew he’d never repay. On blue-sky weeks when he won more than he lost, he’d go out and buy himself something he cherished — a new titanium driver; a pricey pair of Jordans — then sell them on for half when he went bust. “I’d walk around my place whenever I hit zero, seeing everything I owned as dollar signs.” His beloved baseball glove; the cashmere quarter-zips his grandma bought him for Christmas — anything to raise a hundred bucks and feed the addiction. Andrew got addicted to betting in college, playing — and hitting — his first-ever backdoor cover. “I had Duke in March Madness, and was just about to lose,” he recalls. But then a ref blew the whistle as the buzzer sounded, giving Duke two meaningless free throws while up by four. With a make on the second, Duke won by five, miraculously beating the spread of 4 1/2, per Andrew’s telling. His brain went kablooey on dopamine. “I can’t even describe it — it was the best feeling ever. I thought it was gonna work like that all the time.” Gambling experts talk about the “first-win trap” — a neurochemical surge that swamps the pleasure center, sparking delirium only matched by high-test heroin. “The reward’s beyond anything in our day-to-day lives,” says Gaskell. “It’s literally off the scale we see in” brain scans. “There’s a reason we call gambling a substance disorder,” says Levant. “But the substance isn’t the dough — it’s the dopa.” Andrew gave up baseball, got a degree in health fitness, and earned a good living as a trainer in Atlanta. He was constantly in the hole, though, laying a dozen bets a day with the bookies or the offshore apps. Then he met a girl and moved her into his place. Months later, she was pregnant with their twins. “She’d no idea I gambled; no one did, till finally my parents caught on.” That’s the core difference between gamblers and other addicts. There’s nothing physical that gives them away: no unexplained weight loss; no cocktail-hour slurring. That secrecy, born of shame, can destroy a spouse and family. They don’t find out that their loved one’s stolen from them till the marshals are at the door with eviction papers. In 2023, the Public Health Advocacy Institute filed a class-action consumer-fraud lawsuit against DraftKings. A judge rejected the company’s motion to dismiss. Mark Cunningham/MLB Photos/Getty Images For every person hiding a gambling disorder, six people in their orbit are impacted financially, according to the World Health Organization. The collateral impacts of new gambling addictions are just now being charted by clinicians. Among states that have legalized sports-bet apps, bankruptcies are up by 30,000 a year, per a USC-UCLA study still in progress. A second study, from Northwestern, found that eight percent of the households in legal-gambling states were wagering on SBOs — and that every dollar spent on those apps cost households double in net-worth losses. And so states that took the bait of new-tax windfalls find themselves in a hole. Who’s going to cover the living expenses of families ruined by problem bettors? And who’s going to pay for those bettors’ treatment when, or if, they seek help? (Less than 10 percent of gambling addicts ever come in for counseling, per the National Council on Problem Gambling.) Of all the grim ephemera linked to legal gambling, this fact might be the starkest: For every dollar paid in taxes by SBOs, the states spend, on average, .0009 cents providing therapy for the addicts they’ve helped create, according to theNCPG . WHAT’S A YOUNG MAN TO DO when all the outlets he watches — ESPN, Paramount+, Peacock, Fox Sports — either own or have partnered with a sportsbook? When FanDuel and DraftKings push him their bet boosts while he’s scrolling reels? When SportsCenter plates him up a side of “Bad Beats” to pair with its “Top Ten Plays”? The effect of all that noise is to sell a tautology: that gambling is harmless fun when done in measure. It’s both the message and the method of the SBOs, who affix their buzzwords — “responsible gaming,” or RG — to the toe plate in all their ads. I called their collective trade rep, the American Gaming Association, to get a sense of RG in practice. Joe Maloney, a senior vice president, explained it to me — after expressing shock that kids use the apps. “The prevailing legal age for wagering is 21,” he told me. “We verify identities, we verify ages — and if a parent is opening [an account] for the use of a minor, that’s a violation of our terms of service. And if it’s found to have been done, then those individuals are banned from having accounts at these sites.” “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” I granted the point, and pressed him about RG. Maloney was just getting warm, however. “We have a code of conduct that includes not casting anyone under 21 in our ads, and ensuring that the known audience of paid advertising is believed to be above 73 percent 21 [or older],” he told me. “We ban all university partnerships. We ban all agreements with NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] athletes. There’s no leafletting and pamphlet dropping on college campuses. None of those things are permitted.” He went on like this for 15 minutes, laying out the Four Pillars of RG. “Stick to a budget. Bet legally [i.e., on their apps, not offshore sites]. Know the odds. And keep it fun. Do it in the company of others,” said Maloney. “This is not a wealth-creation exercise [or] an investment vehicle. This is entertainment.” Since grade school, we’ve been trained to blame the addict for addiction: a failure of will and want-to in the weak. Even when the truth emerges, we still default to that warhorse, character, as the root of personal ruin. It’s only when the operators are forced to pay out fortunes that we finally fault the poisoner, not the poisoned. Hundreds of billions recovered from the tobacco companies, not counting the giant verdicts they keep losing. More than 6.5 billion from the Sackler family. In America, the facts must defer to the funds. Our justice is a giant cardboard check. No one knows that lesson better than Dick Daynard, the godfather of tobacco litigation. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he founded a pivotal nonprofit, the Tobacco Products Liability Project, as a young attorney in the Eighties. TPLP became the tip line and database for the lawyers, reporters, and confidential sources who finally beat Big Tobacco in the mid- to late-Nineties. We’re sitting at a table in his offices in Boston, a quarter or so mile from Fenway Park. Joining us is Mark Gottlieb, Daynard’s voluble chief of staff, and the jet-lagged Harry Levant, just back from two symposia in Colorado. It was Levant who approached Daynard with his next crusade: suing the SBOs for the harms done to their users. Daynard, a laconic sort who wouldn’t order a hot dog without due process, tasked his staff to study the matter closely. “The doom loop of addiction?” says Gottlieb. “The losses that last till the customer drops? It wasn’t a tough decision to go forward.” Harry Levant is a longtime foe of the SBOs: “Among the dangers of celebrity endorsements is the normalization of an addictive product.” Thato Dadson/Courtesy of Harry Levant Through TPLP’s successor, the Public Health Advocacy Institute, Daynard’s team brought the first sports-bet lawsuit in Massachusetts in 2023. They picked DraftKings as their opening-round opponent. The complaint they filed was a strategic one: a tautly focused claim of consumer fraud. “Plaintiffs allege that the offer of the $1,000 bonus … was and is unfair and deceptive because, among other things, a new customer would, in order to get a $1,000 bonus, actually need to deposit five times that amount and then, within 90 days, place $25,000 in bets with only certain odds of return,” the suit reads. “In other words, the ‘$1,000 Bonus’ is structured so that it is inordinately expensive to obtain $1,000, and the new user is, instead, statistically likely to lose money by chasing the bonus.” “In what world would anyone call that ‘responsible gaming’?”  Daynard says. He filed the case, a class action, in Massachusetts, a state with stringent consumer-protection laws. DraftKings, for its part, filed a motion to dismiss. Its argument? “No reasonable consumer would have understood the Promotion in the terms that Plaintiffs allege.” That pleading was roundly denied by the judge; last summer, the case proceeded to discovery. Barring a settlement, the case heads to trial in two years. Meantime, Daynard’s colleagues are scouring DraftKings’ files, combing through tranches of court-compelled data to see if they can prove that DraftKings’ allegedly fraudulent ads are “deceptive to its target customers,” per the suit. To be clear: Gottlieb et al. aren’t bucking for prohibition. Legal gambling is here to stay, and they’re … OK with that. “Abolishing it at this point is DOA; there’s too much critical mass to take it down,” says Levant, who recently moved to Boston as the gambling-policy director of PHAI. “All we ask for are common-sense changes to the way these outfits do business.” For a list of those changes, I spoke to John Keenan, a reformer in the Massachusetts Senate. Keenan’s seen this rodeo before: He chaired the Senate’s Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse through the last two waves of the opioids crisis. “When you look at Purdue Pharma, what did they have? A new product they hawked relentlessly — and often falsely,” says Keenan. Same difference with Big Sports Bet, except “their marketing’s an onslaught: They’ve rewritten the book on selling addictive products.” So Keenan’s sponsored a bill called the Bettor Health Act. Besides raising the state-tax rate on SBOs from 20 to 51 percent, it would instantly ban all sports-bet ads during live, in-game broadcasts. Further, it would outlaw player props, i.e., a parlay on Steph Curry to hit more than four threes and exceed eight assists against the Lakers. (Keenan calls those bets “the crack cocaine” of gambling.) The bill would also slap affordability checks on the SBOs: “If [someone] bets more than $1,000 a day, the industry has to check [his] bank account” to be sure he can support that action, says Keenan. But maybe the best thing Keenan’s bill would do is force the apps to share their data with the state. “If there’s college kids jumping out of windows now, we need to see those accounts to figure out why. We have a moral obligation to those kids and their families. Otherwise, we’ll lose a generation.” IT’S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR now since Andrew placed a bet — but he’ll be the first to admit he’s been here before. “I quit cold turkey in 2020,” he says, “when my girlfriend found out she was pregnant.” Months of sobriety later, he rented a U-Haul and trucked their joint possessions to Pennsylvania. But driving across the line into Delaware — the first state, by a nose, to approve the apps — Andrew was beset by FanDuel radio ads and billboards. That night, he opened an account, grabbed the welcome bonus, and promptly lost his mind for four years. “The guy I became — I don’t know who that was,” he says. Depressed and withdrawn, “always snapping at my girl; all I wanted to do was go and hide.” He holed up in the spare room of the place they’d rented, betting like he’d never bet in Georgia. “Those offshore apps — yeah, I liked my parlays, but they just had the basics,” meaning money line, point spread, over/under. But FanDuel? “FanDuel was fuckin’ Disneyland, man. You could build your own parlay off a thousand different props — and the crazier the props, the bigger the payout.” That, he hastens to add, is how to tell you’re an addict: “We only play the long shots. Longer, the better.” Seven months after the couple moved north, Andrew’s girlfriend left him and took their three-month-olds with her. Andrew hasn’t seen his kids, now four, since; he relinquished his parental rights during that four-year spiral, failing to appear at visitations. Though he’s stable enough now to send her child support, he hasn’t pushed his ex for visitation. “I have no moral ground to be in their lives,” he says. “I burned every bridge and ruined every trust with everyone I ever knew. At this point, it’s just about living my life and trying to prove I can do better.” Though we’re speaking by phone, I sense his mood straying, drawn to the shadows of the past. There’s a species of forgetting when you’ve lived apart, a gap that can’t be filled by stepping back into the world. Of all the sunk assets, faith is the dearest: faith that you still matter out there, and still share a language with other people. To reclaim that faith, Andrew’s gone public with his story, telling it to anyone who’ll listen. He’s appeared, under his own name, on CNN and CBS; spent hours on the phone with me to be sure I get it all; and made himself available to the people he hurt, giving a ruthless accounting of his sins. He has no expectation that the truth will set him free, or serve as recompense for the past. “I’m just putting this out there [in hopes] that someone hears it and does something before a bunch of people die. The way these companies play you, chase and harass you till you’re worse than broke and get to thinking, ‘Maybe it would be better if I was gone.’”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mobile-sports-betting-gambling-addiction-fanduel-draftkings-1235444172,Entertainment,the guardians,"Paul Solotaroff,Eli Senor",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bet-the-devil-LEAD.jpg?crop=0px%2C1697px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-12T13:00:00+00:00,2eec81bda5622269601c6dcb02515557adfd2b80
4aec03e0ed9c,What You Tell an AI Chatbot Could One Day Be Evidence in a Criminal Trial,,"On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was federally charged for setting the blaze that eventually became the massive and deadly Palisades Fire, which ravaged coastal communities of Los Angeles County throughout the month of January. Authorities mentioned various pieces of evidence that they said supported the case against Rinderknecht, but they spotlighted a particularly novel one : records of his exchanges with ChatGPT . The 29-year-old Florida man allegedly prompted OpenAI ‘s chatbot to create images of cities and forests engulfed in flames, told it about feeling “liberated” after burning a Bible, and, shortly after igniting a brush fire just after midnight on New Year’s Day, asked it, “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?” Rinderknecht has yet to enter a plea, but if he goes to trial, the case could offer a meaningful glimpse into how the proliferation of AI technology will affect criminal investigations and prosecutions in the future. Users have proven overly trustful of chatbots, treating them as therapists, confidants, and even romantic partners onto which they can unburden intimate secrets. The reality is that they are divulging sensitive information on platforms that offer no legal confidentiality, developed by companies that will readily turn their data over to law enforcement if served with a subpoena, warrant, or court order. A New Frontier All this makes chatbot records a potential bonanza for law enforcement, tech and legal experts tell Rolling Stone , perhaps more valuable than the text messages and social media footprints that currently serve as important areas of focus when authorities scrutinize individuals linked to a crime . Generative AI correspondence, too, is soon to be a regular part of criminal investigations and trials. “There is no doubt that AI chatbot logs are going to take center stage in evidentiary disputes across the nation,” says Kyle A. Valente, an attorney with the law firm Bressler Amery & Ross PC who published a paper on the topic last month. “Civil practitioners will want to obtain chat histories to show intent or motive in cases dealing with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the like,” he says, while prosecutors are seeking to introduce these files to establish elements of a case such as mens rea , or a suspect’s knowledge of wrongdoing. Though a number of civil lawsuits related to user harm are currently pending against AI firms, criminal prosecutors have hardly begun to explore how they can leverage defendants’ chatbot usage to secure convictions. Valente cites one remarkable early precedent: a man from Roanoke, Virginia, was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison for first-degree murder after prosecutors argued that his messages with Snapchat ‘s My AI bot demonstrated premeditation in a 2023 slaying. Before fatally shooting another man in a petty dispute, the now convicted defendant, 18 years old at the time, told the bot he was going to “fight” and asked it, “What if I shot them if they step on my property with hostile intent?” (The chatbot replied that it could not “condone or encourage any violent or illegal behavior.”) ‘It’s Like Your Diary Times 10’ “DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in all these crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone,” says Rob T. Lee, a digital forensics and AI expert at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training cooperative. “What happens now with AI, you’re having a full conversation with these chatbots. It is no longer just a search for a topic.” Whereas criminal suspects in this past may have been incriminated by a Google query on, say, how to clean up bloodstains, a more comprehensive, detailed back-and-forth with a tool like ChatGPT gives investigators far more opportunities to prove intent and mindset, Lee explains. “All of that is logged, and it’s all sitting on servers,” he says. “It’s like your diary times 10.” “We saw this with social media, where all of a sudden, law enforcement started to understand that a lot of important, relevant evidence could be gleaned from social media posts and profiles,” says Meetali Jain, a tech and human rights lawyer who serves as director of the Tech Justice Law Project and is representing multiple parents in lawsuits alleging that AI products encouraged their children to commit suicide. “That became a standard part of a criminal investigation. I think we’re going to start to see that in this context too.” The difference, she says, is that this next development concerns “machine-generated outputs,” and there aren’t established rules around how this kind of material can or should be admitted as exhibits in court. “It’s very much a live issue,” Jain says. Valente concurs: “At this early juncture, the bounds are limitless until such a time as courts issue opinions that establish some framework for dealing with this type of evidence,” he says. A Fundamental Difference Vincent Conitzer, director of the Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and head of technical AI engagement at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, also says that chatbot exchanges fundamentally differ from text messages with another person, who we would expect to take action to prevent a crime if told about it in advance. “Will we have similar expectations of a chatbot?” Conitzer asks. “Already the companies try to have guardrails so that their chatbots do not help someone commit a crime, though those guardrails are still very brittle.” Indeed, an NBC News report this week revealed that ChatGPT can be manipulated into giving directions on the assembly of chemical and biological weapons. And Matthew Livelsberger, the veteran who on New Year’s Day fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas right before an incendiary device blew up the vehicle, used generative AI to help plan his attack. Lee notes that several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime. “They’re getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they’re doing similar for people [in the U.S.] that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror,” he says. Human Review OpenAI has said it employs a human review team that is authorized to electively inform law enforcement when they come across content that “involves an imminent threat of serious physical harm to others.” How often they escalate to this level of alarm is unclear. “They’re not doing press releases on it,” Lee says, speculating that they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, “which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.” The major American AI players are much more tight-lipped, Lee says, on their ability to detect a possible school shooter, to take one example. And, as Jain points out, if they are picking up these warning signs, reporting them isn’t mandatory. “I think [the companies] are going to say, ‘Look, we can’t be responsible for what kinds of queries users pose to us through our chatbot, we can’t possibly know what he was going to do,’” Jain predicts. She is struck by the fact that when the Justice Department put forward its claims about how Rinderknecht had used ChatGPT before and during the Palisades Fire, they didn’t mention OpenAI or whether the program could have appeared to encourage “harm to others.” Chatbots are known to validate users’ obsessions and delusions , and most of the litigation around this phenomenon has so far pertained to self-harm, as in the suits Jain has brought against OpenAI and Character Technologies. The question of the role a chatbot might come to play in an episode of outward violence or destructive behavior is murkier still. “​​The focus is going to be on further substantiating the culpability of the individual, at the expense of really looking at how the companies designed their chatbots,” Jain says, likening the issue to entrapment, a scenario in which law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime. She envisions prosecutors homing in on a “gotcha moment” in a defendant’s chatbot logs, “without any sort of understanding of how the machine got to that output.” “I feel like it’s going to be a very one-sided story,” Jain adds. “I can’t imagine that a company is going to stick up for the rights of users.” Nevertheless, it seems there’s little the major AI players can do to avoid being drawn into criminal proceedings in the months and years ahead. Valente, for one, expects that their legal and compliance departments will take a “proactive” approach to the problem. What would that entail? “Revisiting privacy policies and updating terms and conditions,” he says.

Years After His Arrest, She’s Still Searching for Answers",,"For almost 30 years, the city of Wichita, Kansas was terrorized by a serial killer. He called himself BTK , a nickname patterned after the phrase “bind, torture, kill” — the signature way he would leave bodies for police to find. His victims varied, first a young family, then women of varying ages and economic backgrounds — sometimes going years between murders. Investigators were assigned and reassigned to the case, poring over clues and evidence. These included letters from BTK himself, taunting police on being unable to catch him. By 2005, BTK was considered one of the biggest cold cases in the entire state. Kerri Rawson — who had grown up in Wichita — was living in Michigan but hadn’t forgotten the moniker of the wanted murder. But when FBI agents showed up to her door on a snowy morning that February she couldn’t reconcile her knowledge of the serial killer with what the people in front of her were saying. BTK wasn’t a cold case anymore. A suspect had just been arrested, and it was her father, Dennis Rader. In June 2005, Rader pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is incarcerated in the El Dorado Correctional Facility in El Dorado, Kansas , serving 10 consecutive life sentences. But for Rawson, her father’s secret double life — a religious family man in public and a sadistic serial killer in private — has haunted her since the police’s discovery. Now, she’s trying to reckon the man she knew with the murderer she despises. In the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer, the investigators, media, neighbors walk through their memories of the search for BTK — all while Rawson tries to plan out what her future looks like without him. Here are four things we learned from the new Netflix documentary My Father, the BTK Killer . Stephen King’s interview about his book A Good Marriage inspired Kerri Rawson to break her family’s year long silence . Even after the FBI informed Rawson of her father’s arrest and history as a serial killer, there was a part of the Kansas native that didn’t believe her father could have done it. While reckoning with the news, neither Rawson nor her mother believed that police had the right person. Following the media storm, Rawson says in the documentary that she turned down major interviews with people like Diane Sawyer and Oprah. “I spent almost 10 years rotting inside after he was arrested. Not being able to speak, not thinking I was allowed to speak,” she says in the documentary. “In the Midwest code, you don’t ever air your dirty laundry publicly. You just keep it inside and you look appropriate on the outside.” But one night, while she was watching television, Rawson caught a 2014 interview with thriller author Stephen King . King was promoting his novella A Good Marriage , about a happy wife whose life is thrown into disarray when she discovers her husband is secretly a serial killer. King said he was inspired in part by Rader’s arrest, more specifically, by his ability to keep his murderous tendencies completely unknown to the rest of his family. Rawson felt like the book was exploitative of her father’s victims, and decided that it was finally time for her to share her own perspective. “I had been silent for so long,” she says. “And there was so much stuff that needed to come out.” Rader was known in his community as a kind and quiet man, but his family said he had a vicious temper. One of the biggest shocks after Rader’s arrest was how long the convicted killer was able to plan and execute serial killings in his own community without being arrested or even suspected. People in his community of Park City, Kansas — a small town outside Wichita — remembered Rader as a quiet, kind, and rule-following man. He worked as a compliance officer for the city, and was known by many people as the official dogcatcher. In addition to being a stickler for city ordinances, Rader was known to participate heavily in outside activities like leading his son’s Cub Scout group and doing administrative tasks at the Christ Lutheran Church. “He didn’t just fool his family,” family friend and neighbor Andrea Rogers says in the documentary. “He fooled a church. He fooled an entire city. He literally fooled everybody.” But even before his family was told about his extracurriculars, Rawson says that she, her mother, and brother were all aware that her father had an angry personality that the rest of the world couldn’t see. In the documentary, Rawson says that the family often left Rader choose everything from their activities to the movies they watched to where the children went in their free time, for fear of upsetting him. And they also knew that even the smallest of mistakes, like leaving their shoes out or someone taking his assigned seat at the kitchen table, could result in massive outbursts. “My father, on the outside, looked like a very well-behaved, mild-mannered man. But there’s these moments of Dad, [where] something will trigger him and he can flip on a dime,” Rawson says in the documentary. “And it can be dangerous.” Rader often used his family life as a cover for his murders . When police interviewed him following his arrest, Rader admitted that he used his family events as helpful cover for his murders, but noted that his busy schedule most likely kept him from killing more people. Though none of his family say they had any idea he was a serial killer, the clues were hidden in plain sight. When police first searched Rader’s house, they found his kill bag — a bag complete with a gun, ropes, and other break-in items — stored prominently in the entryway’s coat closet. In Rader’s office, evidence of his kills including personal items belonging to the victims, were kept accessible in an unlocked filing cabinet. Rader and his family were active and often took vacations and trips in popular tourist destinations like the Grand Canyon and the National Parks . They were also avid fishers, campers, and hikers, with Rawson noting she and her father both loved the outdoors. “He said later on that having kids slowed down his murders,” Rawson says in the documentary. “Dad said he got busy raising kids. I think he got busy chasing me.” One of the last letters of clues Rader sent police before his longest hiatus was mailed on the night of Rawson’s first birthday party. But many of those activities also helped Rader avoid initial suspicion in the murders. On Jan. 18, 1991, Rader went to a  Cub Scout event before sneaking away to kill 62-year-old Dolores Davis. After using his station wagon to store bodies and murder gear, he later gave it to Rawson in high school for her own personal use. “That was not okay,” Rawson says. Rawson helped police name Rader as the suspect for at least one additional murder . After Rawson learned that her father was the BTK killer, she says in the documentary that she went through a very long period of emotional upheaval. Days after Rader’s arrest, she and a large group of her extended family gathered in the same house, eating food and telling stories about their treasured memories while the media circus continued to swarm outside. Rawson says it was like a funeral but she still loved her father. Instead, she focused her anger on the media attention and people who were hounding her family. “Our lives were just gone,” she says in the documentary. “It was upheaval, totally insane. I was just mad at everybody.” After her father was convicted, Rawson reached out to him in prison and tried to continue some aspect of their relationship, letting him know she was always available to talk but that she desperately wanted answers. He didn’t answer her questions, but he did say he loved her and thought of her. Since Rawson and Rader had an open line of communication, police asked Rawson to aid them in finding if there were any more victims then the 10 he had claimed.  Rawson not only went through Rader’s personal notes and diaries, but met with him and asked him point blank about the possibility of other victims. Rader denied being involved. After going through his notes and personal belongings, police named Rader as the prime suspect in the 1976 disappearance of one other woman: 16-year-old Cynthia Kinney from Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Kinney was working at a laundromat when she went missing, a fantasy detailed extensively in one of Rader’s journals. Police have never found Kinney’s body, so any conviction would require stronger evidence linking Rader with Kinney. Rader still denies it. Rawson says she can’t reconcile her father with BTK — and she’s done trying to . According to Rawson, the Kansas native has spent much of her adult life trying to cope with the trauma of learning her father’s real nature. For a while, this was alleviated by trying to help police with their investigations, corresponding with her father, and working with organizations meant to help victims of violent and high profile crimes. In 2019, she wrote A Serial Killer’s Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming , her first memoir. Her second, Breaking Free: Overcoming the Trauma of My Serial Killer Father , was published in 2023. Both of the books were national best sellers. But even after helping the police and victims advocacy groups, Rawson says she still struggled with her own repressed memories from her childhood. In the documentary, she describes having a period of night terrors and fearful periods where she was constantly paranoid of a home invasion. These lasted for months, often resulting in her wetting the bed and crying out for help. Now, Rawson thinks part of that may have been her somehow understanding her father’s actions. “I think my subconscious [has been] trying to get it out of me since I was a little girl,” she says. “Saying, ‘Hey, there’s a bad man in my house.’” Rader kept detailed notes about his victims and killings, but many of them were interspersed among writings about daydreams and fantasies. In one of his notebooks, Rawson found her own name next to a date and his codes for bondage and sex. Rawson confronted her father during a visit to his prison. He denied ever sexually assaulting her or any member of her family — saying he only fantasized about it — but Rawson says she exploded. She berated him about how intertwined his serial killing life and her life were. And when she was done, she left. She says the person sitting across from her at that table wasn’t a father she recognized. So she’s done spending so much time trying to make sense of why her father committed his crimes. Rawson says that she will always continue her work with victim advocacy groups, but for now, she’s exploring what her life, memories, and career look like without her father or his impact. At 80 years old, Rader is still serving consecutive life sentences and will never be released. Rawson doubts she will ever visit him again. “I’ll grieve those memories and that girl and that family. I lost all of it,” she says. “But I just didn’t really want to give him any of me anymore.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kerri-rawson-my-father-btk-serial-killer-kansas-documentary-1235443801,Entertainment,the guardians,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/My_Father_The_BTK_Killer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-11T14:30:00+00:00,223000a1e29f13b60d46c7cb7b230bded6837439
829c9f4048a8,Allen Iverson on Chilling With Biggie and Getting Way Too High,,"In the following excerpt from Misunderstood : A Memoir , NBA Hall of Famer Allen Iverson recounts how he wrestled with success, fame, and lofty expectations during his rookie season with the Philadelphia 76ers — while also enjoying the hell out of his rising celebrity. I was back in Cleveland for our first game after the All-Star Break. I had vowed I would show that crowd what’s up after they booed me. But I had a terrible game, and they booed me again. I hated the Cleveland fans at that point. That’s how it went for a little while — losses, negativity. For the first time in my life, it almost felt like I had lost my legs. I shot the ball terribly. I tried to distribute, but my teammates weren’t making anything either. It was like we had reentered that period where we lost 23 out of 24. The Sixers fans were getting pissed off at the losing too. The negative stories about me continued. I held a little press gathering a few days later, at a Reebok event, trying to turn the narrative around. I told these guys the same story, that I respected the legends who came before me. But then they switched it up and started asking me about rumors that I owned a gun in my name. I told them that I did, and that I had to protect myself. With that as the new focal point, it became more of Allen Iverson is a bad guy but add guns to the mix. Feeling like talking just made it worse, I told the media I was done with that shit. No more press availability. I remember a couple days later, after we won one against the Clippers, Pat Croce came up to me in the arena, and he was like, Chuck, you got to talk to these guys. So I agreed to do it, but I took one from the Coach Thompson playbook and said I would only answer questions about basketball. And that’s how I handled it for the rest of the season. It wasn’t just me feeling the heat. Johnny Davis’s job was rumored to be in trouble, and as the trade deadline approached, I think some dudes were actually hoping to get traded. All this shit hurt, but my life kept on being this dream. Reebok officially released The Question. The authentic me was front and center in the marketing campaign. Of course all my family and friends were wearing them. I wore them on the court for the rookie game, the red, white, and blue matching my Sixers uniform. Seeing them like that — on my feet, family and friends wearing them — was one thing, but I will never forget witnessing them out in the world for the first time. I was in my car, and a kid had the joints on. Just walking down the city streets. After I passed him in my car, I stopped and put the motherfucker in park. I just kept it there as I looked at the kid in my rearview. Kept my eyes on him until he walked out of sight. It might as well have been me I was looking at. Here I was, exactly a year removed from driving that first Mercedes off the lot. Three years removed from jail. Not even seven years removed from walking up to Bethel High, just hoping my name was on the list. Seven years removed from hustling. Eight, maybe nine years removed from swiping worms from the corner store and lifting loose change from cars in the mall parking lot. Here I was, in my Benz or my Rolls or whatever it was that day, watching my shoes accompanying this anonymous kid down the city streets. In spite of all the losing that season, I was loving my life. Makes me think of a conversation I had with my mom — years later, but I think about it a lot. I said to her, “I’m getting scared.” And she was like, “About what?” I said, “Everything is perfect right now. As good as it could be.” “What do you mean?” So I tried to explain it. “You know, I been with Tawanna, shit, my whole fucking life. If her day ain’t good, my day ain’t good. Everything is great with us, my kids are doing fine, my family is fine. All the money we have coming in. Everything is cool. But I’m scared.” “That don’t make no sense.” “Everything just seems too goddamn perfect. I feel like something bad is going to happen.” She just said, “Don’t you ever live your life like that. That’s a blessing, man, God is blessing you, that’s a part of being blessed: things going well in your life. Don’t get scared of that, don’t fucking jinx yourself to where something bad gotta be happening or feel like you got used to bad shit happening in life. You know, life is supposed to be fucking great. I know life is hard at times. But when it’s going good, that’s a blessing. It don’t always have to be bad.” So I always tried to enjoy the good times. But I admit, I was never confident they would continue. That’s one reason I think I played like I did, and maybe why I partied that way too. Like you never know how long it’s going to last. It seemed like it wasn’t supposed to happen in the first place. The Reebok Questions got released as planned, but they were hard to get your hands on at first. Everybody wanted them. I will never forget when I was in LA, and after a game, I heard I had a visitor. Came out the locker room, and there he was. Biggie. I was just like, “What the fuck you doing here?” He went, “I came to see you. I need to get me the Questions.” I had to act cool, having this idol waiting for me, to ask me for something. I was like, “I got you.” Then we chilled that night. And I made sure we sent them kicks, obviously. Man, when I got to the league, it was like a world opened up to me. When I tell you that I was going out with my friends to clubs, out late into the night, many times it wasn’t just us. I was chilling with the dudes I idolized, who, like I said, provided the soundtrack of my life. It started before the draft even. I had gone to hoop at Rucker Park, in Harlem, because you had to play there back then. You weren’t the real shit unless you did. When I showed up, all kinds of people came to see the show. That’s when I first met Biggie and Lil’ Cease from Junior M.A.F.I.A., dudes who’d already done exactly what we were dreaming of doing, conquering, getting rich, and bringing everyone with them. They’d made records. I was playing basketball. So after that with Biggie, we’d chill when I was in New York, or when he was in the same city I happened to be in. One night earlier that year, when I was in New York, me and some of my friends were invited to his recording studio. It’s one of those times it felt like I was dreaming. Everyone was smoking, chilling. At that particular point, I only smoked here and there, and even then, I only started from when I was at Georgetown. So I smoked a little that night, but then I started tripping. I remember I went to the bathroom, and I was wearing this Janet Jackson shirt, and the reflection just started freaking me out. Then I couldn’t find my way back down the hallway to the recording studio. Turned out what I smoked was some fucking hash. I really didn’t know what I was doing. So eventually I made it back after some worker found my ass and took me. Me and Ra and E were just sitting there, tripping, as we watched Biggie work on a couple tracks from Life After Death . At that point, it had been a minute since his last release, so this was going to be his next big one. That night, Biggie recorded parts of “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)” and “My Downfall.” Ra and E were imagining making it in that world. I was just a fan watching this genius work, man. Flash forward to March 9, about a month after the All-Star Game, and we had a game in Washington. My mom came to DC to watch my homecoming. Remember, I had missed our first game in DC earlier that year, so now I got to play in front of everyone — the USAir Arena was as close as any NBA basketball arena was to Newport News and Hampton. My mom stayed in my hotel. I went out that night until late. After I had gotten to bed, my mom came and woke my ass up. “They killed your man!” I didn’t know what she was talking about. “Biggie dead.” I got up, shook. I had watched him record, gotten him my shoes. He’d been a model for us as we’d plotted getting out the shit. It was crushing. If anyone had been prepared for death, it was me. From all the dudes I’d seen get killed, Tony Clark and too many others to count, it’s fucked-up to say I was used to it. But I was used to it. Still, when you get the fuck out, like I did, and like Biggie had done before me, and it still goes that way? I thought about that shit all the time after that. And I always remembered when I was a kid, in Glen Gardens, with a barrel pressed to my head. Right before he died, they released “Hypnotize,” the first single off Ready to Die . Then at the end of that month, after his death, the “Hypnotize” video came out. It was so fucking epic, filmed with speedboats and helicopters in Miami Bay. The man had made it, was doing it over the top, just crushing it. Before it all got snatched away. They said he never got to watch the whole video. He definitely never got to see the whole album released. But if you watch that video close, you can see it. He’s wearing the motherfucking Questions.

d8553f32174b,D’Angelo was far more than the shirtless sex symbol he was painted as,,"T he news of D’Angelo’s death following a privately handled pancreatic cancer diagnosis had shocked fans crying Shit, Damn, Motherfucker – a cult favorite from the 1995 Brown Sugar album that heralded the R&B singer as a force in the blossoming neo-soul movement. But the winking references on social media to that crash-out song, about a man who discovers his girl in bed with his best friend and lets rage take over, were soon crowded out by shirtless images of the four-time Grammy winner as tribute. It’s the last thing he’d want to be remembered for. The images all derive from the same source: the 2000 music video for Untitled (How Does It Feel), from D’Angelo’s sophomore album, Voodoo. And to hear the multiplatinum-selling artist himself tell it over the years, he would have swiftly backpedaled from the New York soundstage where it was filmed if he had the day to do over. While the song itself was composed as an homage to Prince, D’Angelo’s handlers had the bright idea to reposition the music video as a mouthwatering teaser for Voodoo that would also exhibit a dramatic fitness transformation that had the singer striking an even stronger resemblance to the NFL running back Marshawn Lynch . Made to look as if captured in one shot, the Untitled video revolves around a brawny D’Angelo as he lip-synched the sex plea while appearing as if completely nude. The pajama bottoms he wore were hung low as possible to remain out of view. Taking the perspective of a lover in close quarters, director Paul Hunter sized up D’Angelo like a meal, setting him against a black backdrop for the camera to tarry on his pectorals, adonis belt and lips. The steamy finished product, which elapsed nearly four and a half minutes and was repurposed for a Voodoo album cover that wound up bearing a parental advisory sticker, effectively rebooted D’Angelo – to that point marketed as the hunky but introverted R&B star from around the way – into an S-tier sex symbol to rival Lenny Kravitz. “I feel guilty because that was never the intention,” D’Angelo’s ex-manager Dominique Trenier told Spin in 2008 . “To this day, in the general populace’s memory, he’s the naked dude.” Mark Jenkins, the trainer who whipped D’Angelo into shape for the video, had regrets, too. While Voodoo debuted at the top of the charts and stayed there, D’Angelo shrank from heightened expectations and came to resent the female fans demanding his clothes as they rained lingerie on stage (his habit of simulating bedroom acts on stage wouldn’t help matters). After touring the album, he withdrew from the spotlight and spiraled into addiction until a 2010 arrest for soliciting blew his cover. His bloated and bleary-eyed mugshot gave news outlets license to kick him while he was down. CBS, that network we’re all so worried about abandoning its journalistic values, literally asked How Does it Feel? in the headline of its news story – a move ripped from the TMZ playbook. All the while critics seized on the chance to reopen the cultural discourse about the hyper sexualization of the Black male body and the limits of the female gaze . “One time I got mad when a female threw money at me onstage, and that made me feel fucked-up, and I threw the money back at her,” he told GQ in 2012. “I was like, ‘I’m not a stripper.’ When I got back home [from touring], it wasn’t that easy to just be. ” But to the fans who really loved D’Angelo, and I include myself here, the sex god image was always a footnote to his staggering musical genius. You only had to listen to extract the truth, that D’Angelo was R&B’s oldest cliche: a preacher’s kid from the deep south who broke away from the church band to pursue his dream of playing secular music. (Ryan Coogler just framed a whole horror movie around this archetype.) A lot of D’Angelo music – the Voodoo album, not least – nods at this spiritual dissonance. My formal introduction to D’Angelo was the music video for Me and Those Dreamin’ Eyes of Mine, the breakout single from Brown Sugar – a quintessential no-skip album. (Ask anyone who was in high school or college when it dropped.) That video, which presents D’Angelo as a one-man quartet, is a much sharper encapsulation of his astounding artistic range and knack for cinching gospel and hip-hop elements together with his feline melismas to make stank-face inducing soul grooves. The Brown Sugar video was a welcome (if too brief) reprieve from the east-west rap wars playing out across cable music at the time, and it sent me on a quest to learn more. I’m still chasing the rush I felt upon finding out that D’Angelo could in fact play all those instruments in between harmonizing with himself, like a latter-day Marvin Gaye, and stay in the pocket in each space; Jamie Foxx and Anderson .Paak, to name two shameless impersonators , owe D’Angelo a tremendous debt for paving an express lane in the music industry for R&B polymaths. D’Angelo was the rare artist who could hear the past and the future. His distinct sound could launch a treasure hunt to track down his influences (starting with mega hip-hop producer J Dilla), and then have you wondering all over again how on earth he put together such a wide array of Black music – from the Native Tongues to Sly Stone to the Pilgrim Jubilees, an old-school gospel foursome. One of my profound regrets in life is missing D’Angelo’s Voodoo tour – which one of my dearest friends, a committed melophile, still describes as “the best show I’ve ever been to”. The making of the Voodoo album – an Electric Lady Studios group project that was happening as the Roots (Things Fall Apart), Common (Like Water for Chocolate) and Erykah Badu (Mama’s Gun) were in session and Jill Scott was popping over – belongs in the pantheon of legendary music folktales . One of the last albums I bought before renting music became the prevailing model was D’Angelo’s Black Messiah – the long-awaited third album that landed against the backdrop of a burgeoning racial reckoning movement. I kept my whole house up for JK Simmons’s turn hosting SNL in 2015 – not because I loved Whiplash, but so we could watch D’Angelo’s musical guest spot as a family . For the performance of The Charade , a systemic racism protest anthem, D’Angelo ensconced his fuller frame in black while his bandmates wore matching tops that read I Can’t Breathe and Black Lives Matter. That image, as much a political statement as a rejection of the Untitled persona, is the one that still sticks with me. A year ago, longtime ally Raphael Saadiq let slip that D’Angelo was working on a fourth album. One can only imagine the emotion and the commotion it would have stirred in this fraught day and age. Altogether, D’Angelo leaves behind a slew of collaborators ( Method Man , Questlove , Lauryn Hill ) and three children; the eldest is an adult son, Michael Archer Jr, who is surely reeling from having to suffer this loss seven months after his mother, Angie Stone, was killed in a car crash near Montgomery, Alabama. A neo-soul pioneer herself, Stone had a heavy hand in shaping D’Angelo’s artistic development, down to braiding the cornrows he wore on the shoot for Untitled – which achieved the 51st spot on Rolling Stone’s list of the best 100 songs of the 2000s. Its music video may have doomed him to recognition as a star-crossed sex god, but his body of work remains his lasting redemption. In the end D’Angelo made three studio albums that defined the decades in which they were released and stand together as one of the all-time great modern music catalogs. There aren’t many artists left who can honestly say how that feels.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/15/dangelo-was-far-more-than-the-shirtless-sex-symbol-he-was-painted-as,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/632e7bc4e8a4583393a57916e4d762114c7b49ff/0_86_1924_1539/master/1924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=50c4103257baa692584198488e31eadd",2025-10-15T16:30:41+00:00,36228e8d03c769e283077d3c6930079d0ff14fe5
6225aeed8af8,‘She does terrible things’: what can a Marvel director do with Ibsen’s ruthless heroine Hedda Gabler?,,"N ia DaCosta and Tessa Thompson are reminiscing about the first time they met, at Sundance film labs where DaCosta was workshopping her debut feature, Little Woods. “Honestly, Tessa had a great vibe,” says DaCosta. “She was super open, super generous and very intelligent.” A smile creeps on to her face. “Like – that was a fucking relief.” Thompson gives a look of mock offence. “I really just like working with smart actors,” adds DaCosta, filling the silence. “Why did you assume that we’re dumdums?” asks Thompson, turning to look directly at her director, as they sit in a Soho hotel in London. “I didn’t,” she is told. “I was just like, ‘What a pleasant surprise.’ Who would have thought it? Not me.” Hedda gives drinks to a recovering alcoholic – and a loaded pistol to an unstable former lover This is a typical exchange from a director and actor partnership that’s now on its third film, and seemingly built on a healthy amount of negging and mickey-taking. The first outing was 2018’s Little Woods, which starred Thompson as a bar-brawling drug mule who contemplates “just one more job” – crossing the border from North Dakota into Canada to acquire opioids . Shot on a shoestring budget, it was a stylish and bracing calling card that set the director, now 35, on a meteoric rise. Since then, DaCosta has become an in-demand director who can turn her hand to just about anything. She brought horror classic Candyman back to life in a celebrated reboot , then teamed up with Thompson again on The Marvels, the $374m budget-blowing sequel to Captain Marvel, and her next outing will be the forthcoming zombie chomp-fest 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. ‘There’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time’ ... DaCosta directing Thompson as Hedda. Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/Prime The pair’s latest project, perhaps understandably, raised a few eyebrows – as they chose to film a play by the notoriously dour Scandinavian playwright Henrik Ibsen. DaCosta’s first exposure to the Norwegian was via A Doll’s House , in which a seemingly devoted wife and mother called Nora Helmer suddenly bolts. The play, which was written in the 1870s, stunned the director. “How daring, to write about a woman who leaves her children because she feels as if she hasn’t fully realised her own life,” says DaCosta. “It would be controversial now. Then I read Hedda and thought, ‘Wow – this woman!’” Hedda is Hedda Gabler, the titular character in Ibsen’s later play. Hedda is a rare thing: a complicated, multi-faceted female lead in a classic drama. It’s a role that has tempted many, even if pulling it off is notoriously difficult. In the UK, over the last decade or so, we’ve had Sheridan Smith’s admirable turn ; a shocking denouement in Patrick Marber’s version starring Ruth Wilson ; and, most recently, Lily Allen, who received mixed reviews . To construct her Hedda, who is the daughter of a general trapped in a stifling marriage to an academic, Thompson delved into theatre archives in New York and London, studying hours of performances with two rules: watch each one just once and don’t take notes. “It got to the pointthat I knew the play so well, I could watch productions in Norwegian without subtitles and know what was happening,” says the 42-year-old from Los Angeles. Another influence was Mae West, the movie star who once found herself in court after writing a play with a gay lead character . She so inspired Thompson that the actor uses Mae as her middle name on some social media platforms. From that heady mix, Thompson created a Hedda as extreme as any seen on stage or screen. To describe her character as quite a piece of work is putting it mildly. She’s a sexy, sultry, machiavellian, vulnerable mess of a protagonist who, as DaCosta says, does “terrible, unforgivable things”. These include thrusting drinks into the hands of a recovering alcoholic and giving a loaded pistol to an emotionally unstable former lover. The fact that Thompson’s Hedda is a mixed-race, bisexual woman adds even more complexity. Brief cameo ... Thompson in The Marvels. Photograph: Marvel Studios In the film, rather than being overt, the question of race subtly lingers: we see Hedda having to deal with whispered comments about her skin tone from party guests. “Her father is white and her mother is black,” says DaCosta. “And you never hear her talk about her mother. That means a lot. But there’s no big speech about being a strong black woman in a crazy time, because that’s not really what we’re focusing on. But it colours everything – no pun intended.” Hedda was shot in Flintham Hall, a Grade I-listed Italianate manor house near Newark in Nottinghamshire, with DaCosta setting proceedings in the 1950s, just as the postwar dust was settling in Britain. “After the second world war,” says DaCosta, whose father is British, “people were trying to figure out what the hell to do with themselves, asking who we are, how you heal. I think people were trying to pretend everything was OK, trying to get back to what was supposed to be the way society runs. These characters are trying to figure out what freedom looks like. I thought that decade would be a really great pressure-cooker to make everything more potent.” For a big, starry film that’s going to be on Amazon soon, the whole enterprise is exceptionally dark. It’s broody and low-lit, with tempers flaring and things falling apart. That’s a recurring theme in DaCosta’s work. “Growing up, I was like, ‘Why did that person just lie? Why did that person do something cruel?’ I think the darkness in my work is really my curiosity about the darkness in other people – and myself.” Hemmed in … Thompson, Nina Hoss and Imogen Poots in Hedda. Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/ Prime All the female characters – including Nina Hoss’s incredible turn as the volatile genius Dr Lovborg, a male lover of Hedda’s in Ibsen’s original – are hemmed in, trying to find breathing space in a patriarchal world. I wonder if DaCosta and Thompson see parallels in modern Hollywood, where one study found that the number of female leads in Hollywood movies had hit a 10-year low. “There are limitations,” says DaCosta, who was born in New York but lives in London. “We need to change that. We’re all chipping away at that stuff.” She mentions the support she has had from Alana Mayo, president of Orion Pictures, which produced the film. Thompson jokes that DaCosta is a “refreshing, honest and candid” voice in Hollywood. After her breakout film Candyman, DaCosta discussed the “ shocking way people have talked to me in my position as a director ”. When she left The Marvels in post-production to work on Hedda after repeated delays, she responded to anonymous briefings against her by saying: “ They knew the entire time that I had an obligation – a greenlit movie with people who were waiting for me.” Today, DaCosta is keen to downplay any idea of her being combative, saying: “There’s no ire in any of my energy. I was on the Avengers set a couple weeks ago because I still have relationships with these people.” She mentions Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios. “He wrote me a letter for my UK visa.” ‘The math is different for me’ … DaCosta at the Zurich film festival earlier this month. Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for ZFF But, despite the smooth personal relationships with major players, DaCosta knows she and other black women in Hollywood face invisible barriers, just like Hedda and Dr Lovborg. “The math is different for me,” she says. “If I want to lead a film with a white actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I know that budget. And if I want to do that same movie with a black actor who’s won two Academy Awards, I get less money.” But for now, the actor she is most keen to work with is Thompson – and, despite the negging, there’s a clear affection between the two. Is it true DaCosta has a portrait of Thompson in her dining room ? “What a very targeted and bizarre question,” says DaCosta, laughing. “Yes, I have a portrait from the movie that’s really beautiful of the character of Hedda portrayed by Tessa Thompson.” “It doesn’t look like me,” says Thompson. “It’s like an expressionist version of Hedda Gabler.” How does Thompson feel about all this? “She got the painting to give to me and then she took it home and said, ‘I will give it to you if you move to London.” DaCosta, suddenly sounding like Hedda the master manipulator, responds: “She knows what she has to do to get the painting. Until then, it’s in my dining room.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/15/marvel-ibsens-hedda-gabler-nia-dacosta-tessa-thompson,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ca4b6d83c717fce4728eb6880005c8fbe2c728/1125_0_1567_1255/master/1567.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d968fe37ead7d119c7f343e7928ccb59",2025-10-15T16:19:26+00:00,71f9f8bae49e628b0391709e392e156e96d3ef99
19b49e3a5239,"Blue, Yoda originally was, archival Star Wars sources reveal",,"“You must unlearn what you have learned,” Jedi master Yoda instructed his stubborn apprentice, Luke Skywalker. And now Star Wars fans may have to do the same after confirmation that the beloved fictional alien was very nearly blue, or even purple. Reviews of archival sources – and new testimony from a special effects makeup artist who worked on the first Yoda puppets – suggest film-makers made a decision late in the development process to switch the character’s skin colour to green. Had producers of The Empire Strikes Back closely followed the final screenplay, then Yoda would have been “bluish”. In the text, Luke and his droid companion, R2-D2, are surprised after being confronted by a small creature who appears on the swamp-covered planet of Dagobah. “Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags,” reads the screenplay. Yoda as he appears in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy Derived from George Lucas’s original story, the screenplay for the second film in the original Star Wars trilogy was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. While final movies always differ slightly from the screenplay, most other elements from the text were kept in the feature film, raising questions about why that detail was changed. Yoda’s eventual colour change is not unknown among fans. Early concept art sketches from around 1978 show Yoda in different hues, sometimes colourless and other times light blue or pink. However, two other printed works from 1980, the same year the film was released, continue to describe or portray a blue or purple Yoda, indicating a late-stage switch. The first document, a novelisation released as the movie was out in cinemas, describes him as “blue-skinned”. One version of that book was even published in July 1980, two months after the film had already premiered with a green Yoda. The Marvel Comics tie-in book of The Empire Strikes Back depicts most scenes as they appeared on screen – only with Yoda a different colour. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian A second, more visual example of a non-green Yoda, comes from comic book versions of The Empire Strikes Back. Several scenes portray him as purple, and also much smaller and elf-like than in the feature film, with long white hair. The book, a collected version of the Marvel Comics adaptation of the film, depicts most scenes as they appeared on screen, suggesting the decision to change Yoda’s colour was made after most other character and set decisions were agreed. It is not clear why Yoda was changed to green. Attempts to seek comment from Lucasfilm and its parent company, the Walt Disney Company, went unanswered. Many senior people involved in those early days are now dead, including the comic book writer Archie Goodwin and artist Al Williamson. Stuart Freeborn, the British pioneering movie makeup artist behind​ the creation of Yoda – as well as the 7ft-tall Wookiee Chewbacca and the slug-like Jabba the Hutt – died aged 98 in 2013 . Freeborn is alleged to have mirrored Yoda’s face on his own, and Yoda’s looks were also said to be partly inspired by Albert Einstein. Nick Maley, a special makeup and creature effects designer who worked on the Star Wars series, said he was not sure exactly who decided to make Yoda’s character green, but that the decision had already been made before he joined the project in 1979. In the comic version of the film, Yoda has long white hair and appears much smaller than he does in the film. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian “By the time I got to work on him, he was green,” said Maley, who is sometimes referred to as “That Yoda Guy” because of his work on Yoda’s skin. “I have a memory of a particular drawing … I seem to remember him being green in that drawing, and that would be before we’d ever started trying to try to make him.” Maley did, however, note there was a rushed period in the summer of 1979 when Yoda’s look was finalised at Elstree Studios in the UK. “We sat around for five months,” he said, while producers tried “to decide what Yoda would look like, and then left us like seven weeks to try and actually make the world’s first animatronic superstar work.” Asked about the colour change in the 1980s comics, he said that tie-in books were often made independently of film production, and may have used outdated source material, such as superseded concept art. “All sorts of crap goes on based on misunderstandings through the course of having a large organisation of different people doing different things along the way,” he said. Still, he added that green might have been the obvious choice. “I mean, I assumed everybody kind of tended to think: ‘Oh, Martians are little green characters.’ Right? So, you know, the green alien is a classic in people’s minds,” he said. “I never questioned the fact that he was green. I never asked any questions about it, but we actually put dyes into the foam latex so that we didn’t have to paint it too much. That was green.” Yoda’s character is one of the most mysterious of the many hundreds of aliens in the Star Wars franchise, with his home planet never revealed. Little is known about the species, which is also unnamed, other than they live for many centuries, have strong “force” powers and are always depicted with green skin. There was renewed interest in Yoda and his kind after the release of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian , where an infant member of the species called Grogu plays a leading role. That character is colloquially referred to as Baby Yoda, although they are not known to be relatives.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/15/blue-yoda-originally-was-archival-star-wars-sources-reveal,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a88f7cb780719bcc8446196efde1c4cde1635e11/680_0_6833_5464/master/6833.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8c67a95adfd65ccb93592fe5bf92a43",2025-10-15T15:51:01+00:00,3937fa6a433b2acf13bd7d59db879e0d7869f863
5351d3e40555,Jimmy Kimmel on Trump posting about unflattering Time cover: ‘He just couldn’t help himself’,,"Late-night hosts talked Donald Trump ’s disdain for his own Time magazine cover and a new mandatory TSA checkpoint video starring Kristi Noem. Jimmy Kimmel On Tuesday evening, Jimmy Kimmel relayed concerning news from the World Health Organization (WHO) that antibiotic-resistant “superbugs” are on the rise. Superbugs, Kimmel reminded, are “the world’s most dangerous bacteria that also sounds like a show on Disney+”. “You know, sometimes we get so fixated on Trump we forget that there are other disgusting creatures hellbent on bringing about the end of the world out there,” he joked. On Monday, Trump had “what was easily the most presidential day of his life”, Kimmel continued. “He was front and center on the world stage signing a ceasefire in the Middle East. And then he got home and started going through the internet and he just couldn’t help himself.” Trump made the cover of Time magazine, “which he usually loves”, said Kimmel, noting that Trump used to keep mock Time magazine covers of himself on the walls of his golf club. But the choice of photo – and upward shot foregrounding the loose skin under his neck – upset the president so much that he posted on Truth Social at 1.30am, calling the photo “the worst of all time”. Trump also claimed the magazine “disappeared” his hair. “Every morning is a game of ‘who am I mad at today?’” Kimmel laughed. “Is it the Cracker Barrel logo? Is it windmills? Is it Bad Bunny? Is it the Nobel prize? Or is it the turkey vagina slapping around under his chin? “I’m not sure if they’re even allowed to show his neck on TV,” he added. “Wouldn’t it be funny if the FCC fined us for showing his neck on TV?” Trump also said that he “never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?” “It’s like he’s a TikTok influencer yelling at her boyfriend for not knowing her angles,” Kimmel quipped. “It really is remarkable what a big, fragile baby this man is.” Stephen Colbert And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert referred to Trump’s neck-fold-forward Time magazine cover as “the worst Georgia O’Keeffe ever”. “It’s like one of those optical illusions where you can’t tell if it’s an old woman or a young ball sack,” he quipped. “Of course, the president of the United States is far too busy hammering out the details of a deal to end a generational conflict in the Middle East to worry about how he looks on some biweekly magazine … you would think.” Of course, Trump took time to call the cover photo “the worst of all time” in a Truth Social post. “You want a flattering photo for the cover of Time? How about this one,” Colbert said over a photo of a younger Trump with his friend Jeffrey Epstein. Colbert also touched on the chaos at US airports, as the government shutdown continues to cause big delays. And this week, the Department of Homeland Security introduced a new mandatory TSA checkpoint video starring Kristi Noem. “She’s making something bad you can’t get out of so much worse,” said Colbert. “It’s like when you’re in the middle of getting your teeth cleaned and the dentist punches you in the balls. “Now, most folks are blaming this shutdown chaos on the GOP for the unfair reason that they control the entire federal government,” he continued. “But Kristi Noem’s video names a different culprit – and you’ll never guess who it is, unless you guess the Democrats.” In the video, Noem claims that “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government” and that “our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government”. “Nice try, Kristi, but your partisan attacks will never divide the people at the airport,” Colbert responded. “We are proudly united … in wondering why the rules seem to be different for every line you’re going through.”",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/15/jimmy-kimmel-trump-time-magazine-cover,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b60024b356c4edb9c0a19ed6012e8093d31de1/460_112_1935_1548/master/1935.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db9c1152418a406f0a3ded4c1643b57a",2025-10-15T15:18:42+00:00,7b6869868a13bb95d0a5ff0716d95484bb43f34e
228e9cf1984d,Artists plan nationwide US protests against Trump and ‘authoritarian forces’,,"Artists and artistic organisations around the US are set to take part in a series of protests and events to speak out against Donald Trump and his administration. According to the New York Times , the acts of “creative resistance” will be known as the Fall of Freedom and will take place on 21 and 22 November. “Our democracy is under attack,” organisers state. “Threats to free expression are rising. Dissent is being criminalized. Institutions and media have been recast as mouthpieces of propaganda.” The events will amount to “an urgent call to the arts community to unite in defiance of authoritarian forces sweeping the nation”. The long list of names set to take part include some from the world of film including Michael Moore, Ava DuVernay and Laura Poitras as well as musicians Amanda Palmer and John Legend, artist Marilyn Minter and author Jennifer Egan. Egan, who won the Pulitzer prize in 2011, also served as the president of PEN America between 2018 and 2020. “I welcome this spur to act alongside other artists and insist on our right to think and speak freely,” she said. Organisations set to take part include New York and Brooklyn public libraries, the University of Southern California and the Maysles Documentary Center. The initiative came from a group that includes the visual artist Dread Scott and Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage . “The action is artistic expression,” Nottage said. “Expression is one of the essential ingredients in the American narrative, and it can’t be stymied or silenced.” According to the New York Times, Nottage recently decided not to stage one of her musicals at the Kennedy Center after Trump changed the leadership and took more control of the artistic agenda. “Unless you adhere to a certain kind of narrative”, she said, “you are not going to receive support.” Trump also demanded that Washington DC’s Smithsonian museum be purged of “improper ideology” while arts funding has been limited to projects that align with the administration’s particular political vision. Fall of Freedom is being described as an open invite and guidelines for getting involved recommend examples such as a curated show around freedom of expression, a staged reading of a banned play or a screening of a censored or politically charged film. Confirmed events include New York’s Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art creating a library of books focused on queer artists pushing back against censorship. The announcement of Fall of Freedom comes as a second round of No Kings protest is set to take place on 18 October across the US. The demonstrations aim to hit back at the president’s king-like overreach and follow on from June’s first round which took place in 2,100 cities and towns with an estimated turnout of more than 5 million people.",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/15/trump-artist-protest-fall-of-freedom,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e0e4c5a381c3fb05f6bd09ab177c0f6b7124c1f/0_19_700_560/master/700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8318520144bc6425007949edc29f3ef",2025-10-15T14:09:54+00:00,bb2d6046bccc1be073003ee5f80a8e262b15e3d9
8df558978ed1,From Heat to thermals: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have paired up to flog puffer jackets,,"R eaders of a certain age will remember the sheer nuclear impact of Michael Mann’s Heat on its release in 1995. Not only was it formally ambitious and wildly influential, but it also represented the first time that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro had ever shared a screen. This, more than anything, was the film’s big draw. Two men, each justifiably thought of as the greatest actor to ever work in the medium, bristling against each other in real time. Their scene together in the diner was billed as the greatest spectacle in cinema since King Kong climbed the Empire State Building. Pacino v De Niro was Fischer v Spassky. It was Einstein v Bohr. It was Foreman v Ali. There was genuinely no way to overstate how momentous the pairing was. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat. Photograph: Ronald Grant Anyway, they’re selling coats now. Yesterday the Hollywood Reporter announced that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino have just combined forces for “their first-ever joint brand campaign” on behalf of upmarket outerwear brand Moncler.

Photograph: Platon for Moncler So far the campaign consists of some black and white photos of De Niro and Pacino, and a YouTube video of two empty chairs soundtracked by a cover of Lean On Me while the actors, in voiceover, growl warmly about long walks and nice chats. Because a Moncler coat isn’t just a coat, it’s an “expression of friendship, connection and human warmth”. And signing both Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for the campaign is undeniably a big get; or at least it would have been, were this 1995 and Heat had been their only previous pair up. Because, since then, it’s fair to say that their quality control has drifted a little. The readers who were excited by Heat may also remember just how disorientating it was when they chose, of all the projects in the world, to team up once more for 2008’s Righteous Kill . That film, a generic cop thriller co-starring 50 Cent and directed by the man who made Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, immediately vapourised any sense of excitement about De Niro and Pacino ever sharing a screen together. Not even a third joint appearance on film, in the much more prestigious environs of Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, could salvage the wonder all that much. Now, that may have been because the pair of them spent a lot of their time onscreen swaddled in nightmarishly unconvincing CGI de-ageing technology, which meant that they were less De Niro and Pacino and more two plasticky androids, but that’s really beside the point. Also, it should probably be mentioned that the Moncler campaign would have had a lot more impact had this been their first forays into advertising. However, that is far from the case. Pacino has previously played golf on top of a grand piano to advertise Sky Broadband (in his autobiography he blames this on an accountant who mismanaged his money and lost him $50m) while in 2019 De Niro starred in a Warburtons advert where he got to deliver the immortal line “Bolton bakes best bagel? My butt” (he has offered no explanation for this; perhaps he just really likes bakeries). However, can you really begrudge them for this latest venture? Aside from the – presumably very large compensation – it’s important to remember that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now both in their 80s. Despite the creative missteps they may have made in the past, they remain two extremely beloved figures in the world of film. While it’s true that they’re both very good actors, the photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth. They’ve got decades of history behind them, and that’s perfectly evident. ‘The photos for the campaign show what seems to be genuine warmth.’ Photograph: Platon for Moncler Plus, even though the script for the YouTube video could be lifted and dropped wholesale into an advert for a building society that airs during Countdown, it’s worth pointing out that the pair of them sell the absolute hell out of it. There’s a chance that the wider campaign will be about two old friends in the winter of their lives, sincerely reminiscing about their years together. If that’s the case – and if the viewer is able to remove the cognitive dissonance that comes from knowing that this is all just to flog some coats – then it promises to be incredibly moving. All that, plus it’ll knock Righteous Kill from the podium of their best onscreen moments.

7b03cc4940fa,‘When did I get that good-looking?’: Bruce Springsteen on seeing Jeremy Allen White play him on screen,,"B illed as a conversation with Jeremy Allen White , and promising “a special guest”, there was very little surprise when Bruce Springsteen arrived on the small stage at Spotify’s London offices on Tuesday evening. The actor and the rock star walked on separately, but to the same clip of entrance music: the opening lines of Atlantic City, from Springsteen’s 1982 album Nebraska. It is, after all, the making of this record that provides the focus for Scott Cooper’s new film Deliver Me From Nowhere , that sees White cast as Springsteen at a critical moment in the singer’s life and career. Much of the evening’s conversation, steered by Edith Bowman, focused on the intricate process of becoming Bruce, and the unavoidable peculiarity of art meeting life. Springsteen – throughout, a portrait of reptilian poise – spoke of first sighting White during a sound check at Wembley Stadium, in the summer of 2024. “Jeremy was wearing all white, so he was easy to spot,” he recalled. “I just kind of waved him to the stage and we said hi.” White was already well steeped in Springsteen’s music, had watched hours of concert footage, and read a glut of interviews and biographies. The Wembley show was an opportunity for a greater understanding of Springsteen as a live performer, and to discuss some of the specifics of the Nebraska period with the singer himself. Springsteen recalled bracing himself for an interrogation that did not come: “I thought this guy is really gonna be interested in me …” he said. In the end, however, “Jeremy was so prepared, he really asked very few questions.” It was an intimidating role to take on, White said. He referred repeatedly to the sheer weight of Springsteen information available, the amount of learning he had to take on, and spoke of “the pressure I was putting on myself. Bruce called it ‘focus’. I called it ‘anxiety that hardened, maybe, into focus.’” ‘A lot of energy was going into the musical component of the film’ … Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen in Deliver Me From Nowhere. Photograph: Macall Polay/20th Century Studios For all the learning he undertook, it was through the music itself that he really connected to the part. “A lot of my energy was going into the musical component of the film,” he said. “[Scott] wanted me to sing and play the guitar, and I said, ‘I don’t do those things … are you sure?’” Cooper was adamant. White duly recorded his own versions of Springsteen’s songs. “I remember being in Nashville, at RCA [studio], in the booth, singing Nebraska, and finding some confidence … feeling close to Bruce, in a way,” he said. “When you’re reading a great script, your job is very easy,” he said. “And when you’re reading Bruce’s lyrics, it’s the same. Everything’s right there.” Springsteen also sent White a 1955 Gibson J-200 – the closest he could find to the guitar used for Nebraska, and “just about the nicest guitar you can learn on,” White says. He began guitar lessons, via Zoom, with session player JD Simo. “Hey, I’m so excited to learn guitar with you,” White recalled saying on their first meeting. “We don’t have time to learn the guitar,” Simo replied. “We have time to learn these five Bruce songs.” Jeremy Allen White and Bruce Springsteen on the set of Deliver Me From Nowhere in 2024. Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images Springsteen’s own feelings about the film were initially less complicated. “I figured I’m 76 years old, I don’t really care what the fuck I do any more,” he said. “Yeah, go ahead. At my age you take more risks, in your work and in your life in general.” It helped that Cooper was “a real blue-collar film-maker” making “the kind of film I would be interested in,” he said. “Not your standard musical biopic, but more of a character-driven drama with music.” As the project gathered pace, it perhaps became stranger. Springsteen visited the set often, apologising to White each time he made an appearance. “It’s gotta be really weird with the guy’s stupid ass standing there,” he said. But he liked what he saw: “I’ve said this before, but I kept thinking ‘Damn, when did I get that good-looking?’” In the seat beside him, White wags his finger and shakes his head. Springsteen had few doubts about White’s casting; he knew that the actor was equipped to portray the most introspective time in his recording career. “I’d watched The Bear , and how the camera followed his internal life,” he said. “And if you see him in a film, it’s a cliche, but he’s a rock star.” When he first saw White playing him, he was struck by the actor’s approach. “His performance was totally from the inside out, not just picking elements and wearing them like clothes,” he said. “It’s a non-imitative performance, but somehow it greatly relates to my story and myself.” He saw it as something akin to his own approach to songwriting – to writing about people whose lives differ so greatly from his own. “You have to find the part of them that is part of you.” More unsettling was the way the film forced him to revisit difficult periods in his own life. The recreation of his grandparents’ home in Freehold, New Jersey – a house he once described as “the greatest and saddest sanctuary I’ve ever known” was uncanny; Springsteen described how often he visited the home in his dreams. “So, to be in that house again … it was quite a miracle, and quite wonderful.” Similarly, it was “a very powerful thing” to see Stephen Graham as his father – capturing his volatile early years, when he suffered undiagnosed mental health issues and drank heavily, and the vulnerability and sweetness of his later years. Springsteen told of watching an early screening in the company of his sister, who held his hand throughout. Just a year younger than her brother, “she remembered everything”. At the end, she turned to him and said: “Isn’t it wonderful that we have that?” There was an echo, perhaps, of the feeling Springsteen hopes to give his own audiences through his live shows. “You create an ideal world for three hours,” he told the small crowd before him last night. “It’s not a fantasy world. It’s a very credible world. It has all the wonderful and terrible parts of life … But hopefully there’s an element of transcendence that my audience takes with them. And hopefully it stays with them for as long as they need it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/15/when-did-i-get-that-good-looking-bruce-springsteen-on-seeing-jeremy-allen-white-play-him-on-screen,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cadb27256ef26863db8331361437eabcef99d3f1/278_0_4443_3554/master/4443.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57e50ec682769f27819f420b53b87a13",2025-10-15T12:42:02+00:00,22193d13559e4e9e5c22e6098745987dfe4bbb29
635af44d868e,James Norton set to play Brian Epstein in Sam Mendes’ four-part Beatles film project,,"Happy Valley star James Norton is being lined up to play Beatles manager Brian Epstein in the four-film Sam Mendes biopic of the band, it has been reported. According to Deadline , Norton is to play Epstein, who discovered the Beatles in 1961 and acted as their manager until his death in 1967 . No details have been officially released, and Hollywood studio Sony, which is producing the films, did not comment. Mendes’ ambitious project, comprising four individual films each focusing on a different member of the band was announced in 2024 , and details have been gradually released since. With a release date planned for 2028, Mendes said the films will tell interconnected stories, and it is the first time that the Beatles’ rights holders Apple have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film. In April 2025, the four actors playing the Beatles were presented on stage at CinemaCon in Las Vegas – Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney), Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr) and Joseph Quinn (George Harrison). In May it was revealed that Mendes had hired three writers – Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne – to work on the scripts. It was reported in October that Saoirse Ronan is to play Linda McCartney, who was married to Paul McCartney from 1969 to her death in 1998. Epstein has been portrayed on film a number of times in the past, including by David Angus in the 1991 film The Hours and Times , Ed Stoppard in the 2014 ITV miniseries Cilla , about Cilla Black, and by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd in the 2024 biopic Midas Man .",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/15/james-norton-cast-brian-epstein-beatles-four-part-film-sam-mendes,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c278eafa7e0d7e3a9cc4d2668f6e8843b6a888a7/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=232246dacc5d960da1beee0e7a6297e2",2025-10-15T11:02:35+00:00,4c3f0ec8e4a8d4d8464b7f3d4388d114a0136070
228103e5627c,‘A photographer with a cool and deadly eye’: Diane Keaton’s creativity behind the lens,,"I t’s one of the most memorable scenes in Annie Hall: Diane Keaton’s eponymous protagonist chatting with Alvy on the balcony of her apartment. Alvy asks if she took the photographs displayed inside. “They’re wonderful,” he says. “They have a … quality.” She dabbles, but would like to take a proper course, replies Annie. Alvy starts waffling about “the aesthetic criteria” of a “new art form” (photography has been around for 150 years at this point). Meanwhile, his inner monologue is presented in subtitles: I don’t know what I’m saying. “Aesthetic criteria?” Annie says. “You mean, whether it’s a good photo or not?” Later in the film, during the lobster set piece, Annie snaps Alvy in the kitchen with a Nikon F2 Photomic . As with many aspects of her character ( her style , for example), a love of photography was cribbed from the real-life Keaton. And though for Annie photography is an amateur pursuit, Keaton published multiple pictorial books in her lifetime. In the 1970s, travelling from coast to coast, Keaton shot a series of classic American hotel interiors (she was an avid fan of architecture and design) for Rolling Stone. These pictures formed the basis of the monograph Reservations, her first book, published by Knopf in 1980. The blurb introduced the actor as “a strong, direct photographer with a cool and deadly eye”. ‘I shoot the pictures, but I’m not doing it any big way. I just like images’… Diane Keaton on her photography, alongside one of her Hollywood portraits. Photograph: Diane Keaton/Rizzoli/Guardian composite The images, monochrome and square and taken on her beloved Rolleiflex, show typical hotel lobbies of the era; their tension between minimalism and maximalism. The ostentatious banquettes and the baroque wallpaper; the solitary Windsor chair in the corner of an otherwise empty space. Textures abound: the upholstery of a velvet cocktail sofa; the grain of wood-panelled walls; the reflected sheen of a plastic lamp or rubber plants. The compositions are idiosyncratic, reminiscent of that other Diane – Arbus. A waiter is cut off at the torso ; just half of a painting hanging on a wall is allowed into frame; there’s a decapitated statue. If the photographic benchmark for atmospheric, cinematic interiors is the stunning output of Todd Hido , Sally Mann and William Eggleston , then Reservations deserves to be among them. Idiosyncratic… Keaton’s first monograph was of classic hotel interiors Photograph: Diane Keaton/Knopf K eaton’s passion for the visual went back to childhood. She was inspired by her mother, Dorothy Deanne Keaton Hall, a keen collagist and photographer herself. For Dorothy, looking was “a dedicated endeavour”. In the foreword for one book, her daughter writes: “The simple, sturdy, and reliable Brownie Hawkeye camera manufactured by Kodak documented our family from 1949 through 1956.” Young Diane cut out pictures of Cary Grant from magazines to make collages. In her 20s, the actor would make large-scale photomontages – up to seven feet wide – and though she spent a life constantly creating, she characterised herself only “as a person who cuts out paper, throws it up on the wall, or finds old photographs that I see at the swap meet [flea market]”, and wielded her camera unassumingly. Annie Hall describes her aesthetic criteria to Alvy thus: “To me it’s all instinctive. I just try to feel it and get a sense of it; to not think about it so much.” Keaton too : “I shoot the pictures, but I’m not doing them in any big way. I just like it. I like images. If I see a tree that looks unusual, I’ll just take a picture of it.” Striking … woman attacked by pigeons, Trafalgar Square, London, 1981, by Diane Keaton Photograph: Diane Keaton/Rizzoli “I’m addicted to photographs and photography books,” she told the Hollywood Reporter in 2023. She had more than 60 scrapbooks of disparate accumulated images and kept Sophie Calle’s Blind on her nightstand, to remind her of the magic of sight; that looking is a dedicated endeavour . In an essay for New York Review of Books, Larry McMurtry once described his first meeting with Keaton: “I found her, one morning, sitting in the flower bed outside the Madison Hotel in Washington DC. She was rummaging in a bag big enough to hold a caribou, which contained a camera heavy enough to stun the caribou with, should that be necessary.” I n addition to Reservations, Keaton released several other art books: collections of her own work behind the lens; edited volumes of pictures by arcane or wholly anonymous names; found images from adverts, newspaper archives, auction job lots and the damp basements of production companies. And, often, a mishmash of all of the above. Many of these tomes she put together with her creative partner, writer and curator Marvin Heiferman. Dolores Gray and her poodle companions, from Still Life, published in 1983 Photograph: Callaway Editions Still Life: Hollywood Tableaux Photographs (1983), is a study of Technicolor Hollywood comprising a plethora of studio stills, diorama-like on-set formation posing and publicity shots for magazine profiles. Fred Astaire eating soup; Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman sunbathing; Dolores Gray in a pink Silverline convertible with two poodles and a matching haircut. Gregory Peck was so annoyed about a portrait of his that was included that he wrote Keaton a bad-tempered letter. Keaton described the staged photos as “sad puzzles that filled me with curiosity … the most believable thing about the photographs is the absence of these people’s inner presence. I was seduced by what wasn’t being told.” Or, as Philip Larkin would put it , the record of “hold-it smiles as frauds”. Or, as Instagram would put it: yes. In Mr Salesman (1993) Keaton and Heifermann collated stills from mid-century sales-training videos. Instead of the cheesy, saturated photos of overtly grinning reps that one might expect, there is a noir-like, Lynchian feel to the book. The subjects of the photographs might be the most conformist cogs of capitalism, and the door-to-door grind utterly prosaic, but the black and white images are frequently surreal and unnerving. A silhouette of a man standing half in shadow, power stance, hat held by his side, the patterns of light and shade bring to mind Alexander Rodchenko or Garry Winogrand. There is Brylcreem and there are brogues, but there’s also an insidious creepiness, a subtle menacing. Pages from Twin Palms Publishers book of Diane Keaton Photograph: Twin Palms Publishers In 1999, the pair published Local News , a compendium of 92 photographs from the archives of the defunct tabloid Los Angeles Herald Express . “These portraits are a stockpile of neglected treasures,” Keaton wrote in the book’s introduction. “This book honours them; it honours the pretty, the hopeful, the ordinary, the murdered, the ugly, the tortured, the smug, the guilty, the lost and found … Each human face is a compelling mystery, that looks back at us like a mirror reflecting the absolute fact that we live, we die, we are forgotten.” While much of Keaton’s own work was monochrome, 2002’s Clown Paintings , a collaboration with gallerist Robert Berman – with written contributions by Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd, Whoopi Goldberg and more – was a bomb in a paint factory. A collection of 66 clown portraits by amateur artists, some of which Keaton owned (and had once loaned to the Warhol Museum), these clowns refused to be neglected, refused to be ordinary. Keaton was as “mesmerised by their mute eloquence as she was by their bad taste”. Photograph: Rizzoli Keaton returned to including her own work in Saved: My Picture World (2022), sold as a “visual autobiography”. Pigeons were the subject of some striking shots taken in London’s Trafalgar Square, 1981. (If someone were to make a list of the best pigeon photographs, this one by John Speirs must surely be top, but one of Keaton’s could easily take second place; although perhaps we must also consider the photographs taken by actual pigeons ). Keaton described how the birds took her mind off filming a demanding part in Reds (for which she later earned an Academy Award nomination). “I’m not sure why I began taking pictures of the pigeons,” she wrote. “It might have been due to their constant manic swooping down on hundreds of tourists who seemed to enjoy the outrageously close proximity of our so-called feathered friends.” Upon her death the animal rights charity PETA released a statement praising Keaton’s lifelong love for animals (she adored her golden retriever, Reggie) but which specifically mentioned her fondness for pigeons. Another segment in Saved has Keaton turning her camera on Hollywood Boulevard to capture its lower-key denizens: Z-listers, street performers, studio greeters. “Instead of choosing to capture fabulous movie stars I was in search of the so-called ‘toss aways’. I thought of them much in the same manner I think of myself … just one more lost soul searching for some kind of redemption,” she said. Keaton was never recognised as the actor she was when taking the pictures, but not everyone approved of the side hustle: “I remember taking shots of a particularly dapper older gentleman who spotted my flash, ran after me and threw a bag of french fries at my head.” Overlooked … street portraits from Saved, published in 2022. Photograph: Diane Keaton/Rizzoli Keaton’s unnamed portraits of Tinseltown were another facet of her obsession with the overlooked, the understudied, the forgotten. But really, she was interested in everything. One chapter in Saved is devoted to “Clinical Diagnoses of Diseases of the Mouth”, with images from a particularly gruesome flea-market find. K eaton’s other image-led books (she also wrote two memoirs) are testament to those wide range of interests and predilections. There is Fashion First (2024) with a foreword by Ralph Lauren; a personal exploration of her fashion and clothing choices. Her love of architecture and design is reflected in California Romantica (2008) , an assortment of photos which celebrate the stucco walls, clay tile roofs and prominent arches of the California Mission and Spanish Colonial Revival styles (introduced by DJ Waldie). House (2012) details neglected farmhouses and crumbling warehouses, whereas The House That Pinterest Built (2017) evaluated how she planned her entire home using the online image board, as well as offering interiors tips for readers. Keaton was also a champion of the unsung talents of others. When she acquired a 40-year-old box of 20,000 negatives which turned out to be the work of a commercial photographer in Fort Worth – Bill Wood – Keaton curated them into a book ( Bill Wood’s Business , published in 2008) and an accompanying exhibition to safeguard the quirks and minutiae of American social and cultural life. Afterwards, she donated the lot to the International Center of Photography. In Dead of Night (2021), Keaton and photographer Nick Reid edited a book of eerie pictures of car crashes taken by a county coroner called Robert H Boltz (Keaton had bought his archive). Chiaroscuro images with an eldritch quality, they are an unsettling combination of violence and silence. Unsettling … Robert H Boltz’s Dead of Night, a book edited by Keaton. Photograph: Robert H. Boltz/Twin Palms Publishers And Keaton supplied a foreword for a collection of Ron Galella’s – the notorious pioneer of US paparazzi culture – prints. “Every person featured in this book had a relationship with Ron Galella,” she wrote. “Some denied it.” She was a zealous and steadfast preservationist of artistic and cultural achievement, whether that be her troubled brother’s writing and photographs (published in Brother & Sister , 2020), or when sitting for two decades on the board of the LA Conservancy . (Keaton helped to save two Frank Lloyd Wright homes , one of which she lived in; and attempted to protect the Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel , one of her subjects in Reservations, and the location of Robert F Kennedy’s assassination). Ennis House by Frank Lloyd Wright, one of many properties Keaton campaigned to save. Since her death last week, the entertainment industry has paid homage to Keaton as a brilliant actor and fashion icon – correct – but her legacy should also include her influence in the domains of visual art, design and architecture. Especially, as the New Yorker critic and Keaton’s friend Janet Malcolm once described it, the “mordant melancholy” of the Rolleiflex images Keaton produced. In 2008, when presented with the Trustee award by the International Center of Photography, Keaton explained her raison d’être for documenting, collecting, curating: “So much is forgotten and destroyed in our culture. We all long to be remembered.”",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/15/a-photographer-with-a-cool-and-deadly-eye-diane-keatons-creativity-behind-the-lens,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/664440a5982e216a0fd34954a77410734f979ab5/120_0_1138_910/master/1138.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=266b7d6e16b088f2d37f0e4ac9297d4c",2025-10-15T09:38:35+00:00,609e98f4efb7954d96e438ebb93fadc19b9a590b
2e1de6e1732c,"Experimental, sensual and political, D’Angelo radically redrew the boundaries of soul music",,"I n the mid-90s, the Roots ’ drummer Questlove was approached to work on the first album by a new soul singer. He turned the offer down out of hand: “I was like, ehhh, soul singers in the 90s – whatever,” he later remembered. “I’m not doing this. Nothing about soul singing had moved me, from any 90s offering, the same way it did with Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, Lou Rawls.” A year later, with D’Angelo’s debut album Brown Sugar on the shelves, Questlove had radically reconsidered his opinion: when he spotted the singer in the audience at a show the Roots were playing, he “thwarted and threw off the entire show” by suddenly playing “an obscure Prince drum roll” in a (successful) attempt to attract his attention. “The only person that mattered to me that night in the room was D’Angelo ,” he admitted. It worked: the pair became collaborators, forming the musical collective the Soulquarians with producer and DJ J Dilla in time for D’Angelo’s second album, Voodoo. But it’s also a story that tells you a great deal about the disruptive impact Brown Sugar had. It wasn’t merely that D’Angelo’s debut album was critically acclaimed and commercially successful (it went platinum in the US). It was that it singlehandedly ushered in a new era and musical sub-genre: the term “neo-soul” was literally invented for it, as a marketing tool. In time, “neo-soul” came to signify music slavishly devoted to recreating the past, but that wasn’t the point of Brown Sugar at all. There was certainly vintage equipment involved in its making, a Smokey Robinson cover lurking among its tracks, and a distinct hint of Donny Hathaway and Al Green about D’Angelo’s falsetto vocals: there were hints of jazz, gospel and blues about its sound. But Brown Sugar was resolutely not a mere homage but a product of its era, the work of an artist who cared as much about hip-hop as he did about Black music’s history, who worshipped Prince and – as a songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist – modelled himself on his idol’s auteur approach. Packed with fantastic songs and smooth but emotive vocals, the results didn’t sound like anything else in 1995. But as it turned out, Brown Sugar was merely the sound of D’Angelo getting started. His progress was never smooth – over the course of his subsequent career, he suffered bouts of writer’s block, crippling doubts about the way his music was marketed and issues with drug and alcohol addiction that meant his releases were infrequent and punctuated by long, troubled silences – but it was progress nonetheless: both his subsequent albums offered striking evidence of musical development. Four years in the making, 2000’s Voodoo was more experimental and more challenging than his game-changing debut, eschewing standard song structures for a looser approach that demanded the listener given themselves over to its ebb and flow. It was also noticeably darker in tone, its paeans to carnal ecstasy – most obviously the Prince-influenced single Untitled (How Does It Feel) – and its bursts of taut, sparse, funk balanced by troubled ruminations on Black masculinity and moments that sounded utterly despondent: “I feel my soul is empty, my blood is cold and I can’t feel my legs,” D’Angelo sang on The Root. “I need somebody to hold me, bring me back to life before I’m dead.” It covered a vast amount of ground both emotionally and musically, but it somehow held together perfectly. You didn’t have to agree with the jazz critic who excitedly compared it with both Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue and John Coltrane’s Giant Steps to think it sounded like a masterpiece. The silence that followed (initially spurred in part by D’Angleo’s disquiet at the sex symbol status afforded him by the video for Untitled, in which he appeared naked) was eventually broken by 2014’s Black Messiah: the delay in its arrival prompted Questlove to suggest it was the “Black version” of the Beach Boys’ notorious “lost” album Smile. Understandably, anticipation around its release was high; incredibly, Black Messiah didn’t disappoint. Despite its lengthy gestation, it appeared to fit perfectly with increasingly troubled times: released not long after the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Black man Michael Brown led to unrest in Missouri, its lyrics dealt with gun violence and systemic racism. Its raw, dense, avant-soul sound shifted unpredictably from furious to dream-like: you could hear traces of Sly and the Family Stone’s legendary 1971 album There’s a Riot Goin’ On, updated for a new era. It was superb. It was also the last album D’Angelo was to make, although a single, Unshaken, appeared in 2019. As late as last year, when D’Angelo appeared alongside Jay-Z on the soundtrack to the comedy-drama film The Book of Clarence, there was talk of a follow-up: his long-time collaborator Raphael Saadiq told journalists he was working on a new album. Whether that music will now ever appear is open to question. You could, if you wished, view D’Angelo’s career as frustratingly scattered: it would certainly have been nice if he had released more music than he did. But, then again, he leaves behind a perfect catalogue: only three albums in 30 years, but all of them are of an extraordinarily high quality. It was a conundrum neatly summed by Questlove, who was asked about D’Angelo in the long, grim gap between Voodoo and Black Messiah. “I consider him a genius beyond words,” he offered. “At the same time, I say to myself: how can I scream someone’s genius if they hardly have any work to show for it? Then again, the last work he did was so powerful that it’s lasted 10 years.” The music D’Angelo did release will ultimately last far longer than that.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/14/dangelo-soul-music-legacy,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57a6352ee970e64ef36289c58d45e514da07d6d/0_342_1191_953/master/1191.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a41d9ed9b56ab4ff9b1843dba1a2c109",2025-10-14T19:15:50+00:00,046c2fbaaed2b795be209f9e6a782501826bb16d
05202c6559f2,"‘Almost 30m plays on Spotify!’ When fake bands hit the real-life big time, from Spinal Tap to the Flaming Dildos",,"T hey have sold out venues on both sides of the Atlantic. Their first-ever gig was opening for a former member of Arcade Fire. Their 2024 album has been acclaimed as sounding like a lost classic of 1970s rock. Their two top tracks, Bright and Masquerade, have notched up 700,000 streams on Spotify. In fact, by the numbers, they’re having one of the most buzzy rock debuts of recent years. Yet they don’t really exist. They don’t even have a name. The band is in fact the unnamed five-piece featured in Stereophonic, a hugely successful, Tony-winning drama, currently playing in London’s West End. Written by David Adjmi, with music by former Arcade Fire member Will Butler, Stereophonic earned five stars from the Guardian , which praised its “moments of creative transcendence, including a late-night epiphany so electrifying that the sound waves will excite your internal organs”. Critics dismissed The Commitments until Elvis Costello said: ‘If you want to know what it was like, read this’ Making it in the music industry is often framed as a triumph of individual artistry and hard sweat. Yet a huge number of bands invented for novels, TV shows and films have ended up with real songs and even real hits. Spinal Tap , born of the 1984 mockumentary, landed a Top 40 single – and a reunion concert, thanks to the recent sequel, which keeps the silliness dialled up to 11. The Commitments, the group from Roddy Doyle’s 1987 novel, have enjoyed the sort of success and longevity many flesh-and-blood acts would kill for, from a chart-topping album (the film soundtrack) to international tours. More recently, Aurora, the debut album from Daisy Jones and the Six, was reviewed in Pitchfork when released as the soundtrack to Amazon’s TV adaptation of the 2019 novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Meanwhile Netflix’s animation KPop Demon Hunters, about rival bands, became the platform’s most-watched film ever. Faking it up to 11 … Spinal Tap. Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Both Daisy Jones and the Six and the unnamed band of Stereophonic are often likened to Fleetwood Mac for their 1970s settings, transatlantic lineups and romantic turbulence. Ken Caillat, producer of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours album, even sued the makers of Stereophonic for similarities to his memoir, settling out of court. Rather than any one act, though, Adjmi says he was drawn to quasi-mythological legends of rock music (the seed was Led Zeppelin’s Babe I’m Gonna Leave You) and the band members’ relationships behind the scenes. “I was very interested,” he says, “in this bleed between personal and public, professional and romantic.” As well as Fleetwood Mac, Adjmi looked to the Mamas and Papas, Arcade Fire and the Metallica-in-therapy documentary Some Kind of Monster. He also drew on his experience making theatre: within a production, as with a band, egos have to be managed “in service of this larger thing”. For that reason, Adjmi resisted the “tired tropes” of rock star rebelliousness and hell-raising. “To be successful,” he says, “you can’t just be throwing pianos out the window.” And cocaine, his research showed, was treated by 70s bands as something akin to coffee: “Just another way to wake up.” Hence the one-kilo bag that gets casually dipped into in his play. Set exclusively in a recording studio, Stereophonic is in some ways “an office drama”, Adjmi says. The band came alive to him not in their music but in the downtime between takes, “eating Chinese food and chatting about crispy noodles”. For a non-musician, however, representing the recording process required a steep learning curve: “I watched every VH1 documentary,” he says. Soon, themes emerged – mostly to do with keeping the music flowing while keeping the musicians under control. This inspired the play’s overarching tension between the banality and alchemy of artistic creation. Butler was tasked with delivering the music and lyrics. One early brief ran: “You’ll hear something transcendent – then someone will stop it for no good reason.” Butler tried to write from the characters’ perspectives, reflecting not the era’s defining songs but the songs they would have grown up with. “Like, Holly heard this reggae song she really liked at Eric Clapton’s house when he was being a total piece of shit. Then they saw Sylvester open for David Bowie in 1975 in San Francisco.” Butler even projected forward, imagining the band as a formative influence for Michael Stipe, and their seminal album on repeat in the Cobain family home. It wasn’t enough for the songs to be both good and consistent with the time, he points out – they also had to serve the play, bolster the drama and justify the focus on this particular band. “The whole play,” he says, “they’re talking, talking, talking. Then they play music and you’re like, ‘Oh, it makes sense – this is why they’re here.’ Those moments of music had to have a hyper-reality.” Pitchfork approved … Riley Keough in Daisy Jones and the Six. Photograph: Album/Alamy For novelists, the challenge is different: to portray convincingly a group that will probably never be heard. Roddy Doyle was drawn to the idea of writing about a band as “an excuse to bring a group of people together”. He also considered a football team, but dismissed that as too difficult. The Booker-winning Doyle is not a musician and has never been part of a band. What made The Commitments work was his choice of perspective. The novel follows Jimmy Rabbitte, an opinionated outsider who “knows his music” and is brought in to manage the band. “By allowing him to just be a fan,” says Doyle, “I was on my way.” Then a 27-year-old teacher in Dublin, Doyle took just six months to write the novel – and one to come up with the band’s name. “I liked the mock earnestness. It wasn’t 100 miles away from bands like the Temptations.” He’d been listening to soul compilation tapes, which gave him the idea “to superimpose this Black American form on to Dublin”. A soul lineup also allowed him more characters – thus more tension. Veteran trumpeter Joey “The Lips” Fagan, was drawn from the Specials’ Rico Rodriguez and Saxa of the Beat, while their look of mismatched formal wear was chosen for comedic contrast. “There’s something just utterly daft about the monkey suit.” For their first gig, Doyle put readers in the crowd with Rabbitte, sidestepping all that technical detail regarding instruments. The rest, he was free to imagine. “Trying to capture the sound of the bass,” he says, “the guitar and the Dublin accent singing the lyrics was a huge part of the fun.” He wrote to those soul tapes right into the night, his ear against the speaker to catch the lyrics after turning the volume down because his neighbour complained. “It would be so much easier now,” he says. “All I’d have to do is Google.” He’d sought to avoid the “earnestness” of music journalists, who dismissed his self-published novel – until Elvis Costello endorsed it in Irish music bible Hot Press. “He said, ‘If you want to know what it was like, read The Commitments.’” ‘A terrific experience’ … the Commitments. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian One of the critics’ objections was that the Commitments found success too quickly. Doyle scoffs. “I just thought, ‘Ya fuckin’ eejits. You think the reader’s going to hang around for 20 years till they’re good enough on the trumpet?’” The Commitments went on to have a “huge life”, with the 1991 film and, later, a successful musical. Doyle co-wrote the film’s script but sat casting out. He remembers feeling trepidatious: “These are people taking on voices that you had in your head for years.” At first they “jarred slightly”, he says, but once he relaxed, “it was a terrific experience”. The Flaming Dildos, by contrast, can be heard only in Jennifer Egan’s imagination, and that of readers of her Pulitzer prize-winning novel, A Visit From the Goon Squad. Egan had been waiting for a chance to write about late 1970s San Francisco punk. As a teenager, she’d been “kind of a wallflower” on the scene, attending gigs at fabled tiny nightclub Mabuhay Gardens. “In terms of a milieu, a vibe, an environment,” she says, “it was just catnip.” She was delighted when the band name popped into her head: “It’s laughably dumb, but it has a kind of snap to it.” Crime, the Avengers and the Germs – the more obscure bands Egan saw play – are namechecked as the Dildos’ local idols. “The Mab” is their regular haunt. Egan’s memories of its expensive bar and “graffiti-splattered” bathroom added realism. She also drew from “crappy videos” of these bands’ performances found online. Suitably “resaturated” in the music of the time, Egan then wrote What the Fuck? – the Dildos’ “best song”, which they practice in guitarist Scotty’s garage. “I had a ball,” she says gleefully. “The lyrics were a lot of fun: both plausible, I think, as a punk rock song and obviously pretty sophomoric.” She even came up with a melody, but declines to sing it to me. “I think it’s best on the page. That’s the God I’m serving in the end.” Bryan Lee O’Malley, the Canadian behind the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series, likewise wrote lyrics for a song his hero plays with his garage band Sex Bob-Omb. A musician himself, O’Malley even printed the guitar chords so readers could play along. It was all a ploy, he says, “to keep the book in people’s hands after reading it. The song’s tremendously terrible if you actually play it.” O’Malley now can’t distinguish between the songs as he’d imagined them and those available to stream O’Malley was writing about his own experiences as an indie kid in Toronto. “It was a world I knew so well. I could tackle it from every angle.” Pilgrim’s bass, a Rickenbacker 4003, was a model O’Malley had lusted after in a shop window, knowing he “could never afford” it. So there was “a bit of wish fulfilment” involved – but he also drew inspiration from Beck, Harold Sakuishi’s manga series about a rock band. “The way he would draw them playing – you could feel the songs, even though you could never hear them.” When Sakuishi’s songs were recorded for an anime TV series, O’Malley hated the results. “That isn’t what they sounded like in my mind.” When it came to giving an actual sound to Sex Bob-Omb for Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Edgar Wright’s 2010 film adaptation, O’Malley referenced the loud, abrasive yet poppy songs of Ohio lo-fi band Times New Viking. An esteemed duo – producer Nigel Godrich and Beck (the musician) – were tasked with making them a reality. “It felt like someone was going to the highest levels to make my dreams come true,” says O’Malley. “Which was cool – and a little surreal.” O’Malley now can’t distinguish between the songs as he’d imagined them and those available to stream. “We Are Sex Bob-Omb has almost 30m plays on Spotify,” he says in disbelief. The band in Stereophonic, says Butler, only became “real” to him once the cast was in place. “It was like a TV show about making a band,” says the musician, who took the actors to his studio to work on their songs but also to give them “the experience of hanging out in the kitchen while there’s some stupid tech thing to fix”. ‘The song’s tremendously terrible if you actually play it’ … Michael Cera and Sex Bob-Omb in Scott Pilgrim vs The World. Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Their baptism by fire was to open for his new band, Will Butler + Sister Squares , at the party for the release of their self-titled album. “The girls all hated it,” he laughs. “The boys were really into it.” In the script, he points out, Diana mentions having played Madison Square Garden. “I wanted them to hear how loud a show is. To do that even in front of 200 people, you realise how horrible it would feel in front of 10,000.” Now the cast have performed to many times that number on Broadway, while the original cast’s recording is available as an album. Adjmi is tickled by “the meta aspect” of his fictional band becoming reality. Stereophonic’s success, he argues, reflects a nostalgia for more authentic, analogue pop. “There’s a sort of naivete, or innocence, that I am pining for in the 70s,” he says. Scott Pilgrim – also adapted for TV in 2023 – likewise channels a time when joining garage bands was a rite of teen passage and local battles of the bands were life or death. Music and culture has changed so much since then, says O’Malley, that “maybe there’s some sort of nostalgic dive into the past”. He remains bemused by the long life of his comic, which he started “as a silly shit-post for my friends”. Doyle, meanwhile, delights in the Commitments’ legacy. “There are people,” he says, “who assume that Mustang Sally is a traditional Irish song.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/14/spotify-fake-bands-spinal-tap-commitments-flaming-dildos-stereophonic-scott-pilgrim,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e7d50ef15ce6af6f2c0dcca42a7514e42338538/475_0_4748_3798/master/4748.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eeba8380df00582ac235797b2d59e5ff",2025-10-14T16:14:43+00:00,c3b9116c8c9b3b669bc52cd3f29a10ada2ba4340
8ebc6016f90a,‘Left me physically exhausted’: readers on their most stressful movies ever,,"When the film ended suddenly and silently I found I was gripping the seat armrests and noticed too that nobody moved. I can’t remember a cinema experience where literally nobody moved after a film ended. It was dead quiet for several seconds, I am guessing that many if not most of the audience had actually witnessed the real event on 9/11 on TV, as I had. Visceral cinema a bit too close to the bone, yet sensitive, nonexploitative and direction as tight as it gets. waxanimal Seconds There isn’t a moment throughout when it isn’t twisting one nerve or many, from the depressed middle-aged man (John Randolph) going robotically through life, to the sinister men (Will Geer and Jeff Corey) who offer him a new life (turned into Rock Hudson) – that he can’t refuse, and can’t be allowed to leave. Left me shaken for days, even though I had been warned. Mariner70 I was both simultaneously claustrophobic and agoraphobic watching it. I would have loved to have seen the 3D version but I think I would have been hospitalised. Monstercat Alien Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Managed to get in to see Alien when it first came out when I was 14. Although it seems quite slow-paced these days, the whole thing, especially the last 20 minutes, had me coiled up like a spring. Remember we didn’t really know what the hell it was threatening Ripley at that point which just added to the tension. johnny5eyes It made me feel almost sick. I had read the book and that was bad but the film took it to another level. I couldn’t stop watching it. It was a few years ago and I sometimes think about watching it again but I just can’t bring myself to despite it being a great film. I’m not sure I’m strong enough! Blidman I remember feeling as though I’d been assaulted in some way, or just staggered out of a car wreck … I did though appreciate the quality of the film and performances etc. As such, I’ve tried to rewatch it on two occasions and I actually just can’t do it. JustAskham Everything was done with subtlety, the corner bed sheet, bedroom door moving marginally, but the real bogeyman, was the real time clock top right of the screen, ticking over capturing almost nothing, except a couple tossing and turning throughout the night, whilst unbeknown to them, a presence is around them, making the slightest of adjustments, within their bedroom. This is the one film, that no matter how many times I’ve seen it, still persists in unsettling me. Aubrey26 I love cold war-era spy films. Spielberg’s evocation of them with Munich is note-perfect. And yet, it speculates on real events and regularly shoves the true horror of this reality in your face. One minute you’re marvelling at the setting, sense of era, cinematography etc, then the next you’re dealing with the aftermath of an indiscriminate bomb attack. Or the assassination of an unarmed woman. Or a suicide. And Spielberg’s lens is absolutely unflinching. It’s as though it picks up the reality that Fleming and Le Carré were riffing off and says ‘You think this is entertaining? Really?’ MotoringJourno Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock Went to watch with a lady on a first (ish) date and after the film ended I expected we would move on to a drink but she said nope, I just want to go home. She felt thoroughly worn down by the film. In retrospect really not the right film to help advance a budding romance. franciscat The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and His Lover It’s the only time I have ever come close to passing out in the cinema. Long ago now, but I think it was the scene where a young boy was being forced to eat buttons that did it for me. Falland Now, be warned, for every horror fan who loved it, there are probably nine more who thought it was like watching paint dry. But for this small minority, myself included, it managed to hit the right buttons, and I don’t think there’s anything else, including Lynch, who hits the childhood nightmare buttons as accurately as that film. It’s minimalist, maddening, deeply unsettling on an atavistic level, and is about as bleak as it gets. hurtinthewarmup Not only it was an unnerving watch. It also left me completely emotionally and physically exhausted after its three and a half hours. The anger, the frustration, sometimes even pure rage it induced in me stayed with me for the next 2-3 days. Such a brilliant movie, but also such a “never again” movie. Panthelya Watched it at the cinema and did not anticipate the near constant tension it generated over its run time.

I don’t think anyone else has mentioned it and I have gone through 14 pages of posts. CONLIBLAB At least with an American film you can distance yourself a little. This film set in the north of England, with very realistic characters, was horrific. I watched on a laptop in bed, which made me feel like I was actually in the film, and had nightmares for six weeks afterwards. Have never watched a film in bed since. Sedation Funny Games Photograph: 46/Wega Film/Allstar Around two-thirds of the audience left halfway through the cinema screening and I regretted for a long time not being one of them. It is a psychological thriller with not a single scene of something horrible while the most horrible things happen in the film to a family. I would never ever watch this film again. HanseatUK1 Brilliant but unbearable. I constantly rewatch films that impress me, but this is once only. And some years after seeing it I actually had a strange young man in tennis kit knock on the front door with unusual questions. I did not admit him. Do not let him in. eroica Haneke cleverly constructed the film to be both coldly unemotional and hyper stress-inducing. I had to pause for about an hour when watching it alone. Definitely a one watch movie. nigeljones A pressure-cooker of a film, with an ambiguous ending … Was it all worth it to achieve greatness? The three of us watching it were, at times, forgetting to breathe, and my fellow cinema-goer to my right even got stomach cramps out of it.

a58546cfe2fc,‘Shattered my whole world’: the wild story behind stranger-than-fiction drama Roofman,,"L eigh Moore was meant to be celebrating her 40th birthday. Instead she received a visit from the FBI. “They told me the man that you’ve been seeing is not who you think he is; he is on America’s Most Wanted ,” she recalls. When agents showed her a picture of her boyfriend to prove it, Moore “fell to pieces” and cried. “They shattered my whole world. I was devastated, like someone had just died.” The man in question was Jeffrey Manchester , an army veteran who robbed dozens of McDonald’s by sawing through roofs. In 2000 he was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004 he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Toys “R” Us store in Charlotte. Manchester clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves and, most audaciously, trying to pursue a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated single mother Leigh Moore, then Leigh Wainscott, before his luck ran out for good. The wild story is retold in Roofman , a film released on Friday starring Channing Tatum as Manchester and Kirsten Dunst as Moore. Writer-director Derek Cianfrance created an immersive environment that included casting people who knew Manchester in real life and restoring an abandoned Toys “R” Us by reinstalling electricity, plumbing, lighting and truckloads of period toys. For Moore, 60, who recently visited Manchester in prison and makes a fleeting appearance in the film as a school crossing guard, it has been an opportunity to reckon with a brief but indelible period in her life – and to tell friends and acquaintances about the episode for the first time. When she first met Manchester in 2004, she was going through a divorce from a 20-year marriage. “One day this new gentleman showed up in our church and there was definitely some buzz going on because we didn’t get new people that often,” Moore recalls by phone from Charlotte, where she works in the motor vehicle industry. “His intentions were to come into the church, sit on the back row and not be noticed. But that didn’t happen.” Manchester was encouraged to get involved in church activities, especially around the holiday season. His first date with Moore was a long walk to a local park and they began seeing each other two or three times a week. He claimed to have just moved from New York and be working for the federal government. She says: “There was nothing alarming about him. He was handsome. He always knew what to say to charm the ladies and make everyone feel comfortable. He was very crafty, very smart, had lots of energy and he was funny . He was well-dressed, clean, well-groomed, very polite, well-spoken and knew what to say at all the right times. “I’m a very trusting person and the pastor adored him and the congregation adored him. I felt safe. There was no reason to suspect.” Moore felt comfortable introducing Manchester to her 12-year-old son and daughters aged nine and 15. “He would bring them a little something to break the ice. He would always get down on their level and try to relate to them somehow. He had kids – I didn’t know that at the time – so he knew how to interact with kids and he was very good at it.” She knew nothing of his backstory. Manchester had once served in the 82nd Airborne Division and struggled to fit back into civilian life. He was rejected by his wife for being unable to support their three children. When an army buddy suggested that he apply the best of his abilities to pull his life together, Manchester took the advice in a wholly original direction. Beginning in 1998, he applied his military precision and smarts to a new mission: robbing McDonald’s restaurants by sawing through their flimsy roofs in the middle of the night and then striking when the morning shift arrived. He is believed to have robbed more than 40 stores and displayed a cordial manner, telling McDonald’s employees to get their jackets before he locked them in a freezer. Manchester was captured in 2000 and sentenced to 45 years in Brown Creek correctional institution. But in 2004 he pulled off a brilliant escape, stowing himself away under a truck that was leaving the prison’s loading dock. Now a fugitive, his choice of a hideout was as audacious as his robberies: a local Toys “R” Us in Charlotte. He built a small survivor’s “nest” for himself behind a bicycle display and sustained himself on baby food and M&Ms taken from the shelves while decorating his makeshift bed with Spider-Man sheets. To avoid detection, he set up a selection of video baby monitors, giving him a constant watch on the store’s employees. From his hidden perch, he learned their routines and observed their behaviour, particularly that of an unpleasant manager whom he watched regularly mistreating his personnel. After months of isolation, Manchester grew tired of being cooped up. In late October he began venturing outside, using an adjacent, closed-down Circuit City store as his secret entry and exit point. He began attending Crossroads church, run by Pastor Ron Smith and his wife Jan, where he quickly integrated himself into the community. Looking back, were there any telltale clues? When Moore teased him about not having a car, Manchester bought a 1999 green Chrysler Concorde for $5,000, putting it in her name and paying in cash. She says: “I thought, well, the government pays really well! We went shopping one day at a department store and we bought a bunch of Christmas decorations, and he paid cash for that. Channing Tatum as Jeffrey Manchester. Photograph: Paramount Pictures/PA “We didn’t go out in public a lot and he would never sit with his back to the door. I thought that was military training because he had a military background. They teach you to watch your back and I didn’t think anything of it. Other than that, I didn’t suspect. He always showed up when he was supposed to. He always managed to get to church and where he needed to go .” Manchester told Moore that he lived in a sterile government apartment and was not allowed to have guests. In reality he passed the time in his hideaway by watching DVDs including Catch Me If You Can , Steven Spielberg’s 2002 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale, one of the most famous con artists in history, who successfully impersonated an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer. A fingerprint that he left on the DVD led to his capture. He had only been dating Moore for a couple of months when in January 2005 – on the day that she turned 40 – the FBI came to Moore’s workplace and told her that Manchester was on their most wanted list. She left with them and was in their custody for most of the day. They asked for her help to capture Manchester and she agreed. Moore admits: “It was heart-wrenching. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do but I had three children, I was a good girl, I didn’t want to get in trouble and so I helped them. They had me call him and pretend like everything was OK, like you see in the movies [though this moment does not appear in Roofman], and pretend that I was excited to see him that night for my birthday and to pick me up at seven o’clock or something.” Manchester duly showed up at her home with a bouquet of flowers. Moore was in the back of a police car about a mile away listening to the drama unfold on the dispatch. “I could hear them saying, we’re in position or that he’s coming or here he comes. Then you could hear him being wrestled to the ground and everyone’s shouting and I knew it was over then.” She spoke to Manchester by phone for a few minutes later that evening. “I apologised for having him arrested and he kept apologising for deceiving me, so there was a lot of crying and a lot of sadness and a lot of apologies made.” A few months later she visited Manchester in prison. There was no further communication until Cianfrance began researching the movie and speaking to Manchester regularly. Moore went to see him again earlier this year and they now speak by phone every two weeks. Moore, who remarried a decade ago, says: “We talk like old friends, we just catch up, we talk about our families and the movie and what’s going on. I’m not in love with him; I just consider him a friend and someone that I cared for long ago. My husband has always known and he’s always been very supportive and so he understands that I do talk to him occasionally. He gets it.” Does she think Manchester regrets his crimes? “As he has had over 20 years in prison to think about things, he is very remorseful and realises that he made some stupid decisions and shouldn’t have gone down that path. Leigh Moore and Kirsten Dunst. Photograph: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures “A lot of us as parents use our kids as an excuse. We want to give our kids more; we want our kids to have what we didn’t have. It started off as that: he wanted to provide more for his kids, make his kids happy. In the movie they show that his daughter had a terrible birthday and then the next year, all of a sudden, she had a very lavish birthday. “But later on he started enjoying playing the game and eluding the police and seeing what he could get away with for how long. He began to like it: the adrenaline, the Catch Me If You Can attitude.” Now in his 50s, Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central prison in Raleigh, North Carolina (he can only make outgoing calls but Cianfrance estimates that they spoke more than a hundred times). He is not scheduled for release until 2036. Yet Moore observes: “He seems so clearheaded and he’s so positive all the time; he’s never negative. He’s in a good place and I’m in a good place. We usually focus on the positive and look forward to the next time we can speak about this stuff.” Both of them welcome Cianfrance’s movie and the attention that comes with it. “I’m glad that the story is out there because for so long I didn’t talk about it. All the people that have come into my life over the last 20 years, I haven’t gone around telling everybody about this part of my past. I pushed it down and didn’t talk about it. Then when it started coming back around, I felt like I needed to tell them. “All my family know, all my friends know, everybody at work knows and so I don’t have to hide it any more. I’m comfortable talking about it and I stand firm when I say that he is a good person; he just made some bad decisions and there needs to be more grace and more forgiveness in the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/14/roofman-movie-jeffrey-manchester,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f97766695efc56dda0c7f6527d8e77ffd6b3c4b/229_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a81348a8babc93012075f1e7739b364",2025-10-14T14:44:40+00:00,7d2a485b1fb9d0239df0cdaf1ec05e6dc7fd7b08
f19c1afc46a6,‘I’m all for instilling more playfulness’: the unusual musical world of Stephen Prina,,"O n a recent Friday night in the vast atrium space of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, six string players took their place in a semi-circle and began performing the first movement of one of Mozart’s most sanctified sonatas. For the first five minutes or so, the musicians played his String Quartet No 15 in D Minor exactly as it was written until, suddenly, the conductor began acting like the host of a bingo game by throwing a six-sided die, with each side representing a particular player. “Two,” the conductor cried, before pointing at the second violinist, who immediately stopped what she was performing and began to play her part in the piece back from the start, while the others soldiered on through the score. “Four,” the conductor called after his next toss, pointing at the cellist who, likewise, went back to the beginning of his part, in the process establishing a pattern of calls and restarts that continued for the next 25 minutes. Amid the unfolding drama, one of the world’s most well-worn classical works was twisted into something strangely fresh, resulting in not so much a deconstruction of Mozart’s work as a reformation of it, with each component treated like a separate piece in a bold new puzzle. “At one point, the sonata started to sound like something by Bartók,” said Stephen Prina, the musician-slash-artist who created this wild riff on the master. “At another, it started to sound like Shostakovich! It just kept changing.” The result, says Prina, “plays with the relationship between the familiar and the unfamiliar. What do you have to do to something that’s familiar to render it so unfamiliar that you can exact a different relationship with it? How do you take works that are on a pedestal and listen to them again instead of simply revering them?” Prina has been posing questions like that in his work for five decades now, using a broad array of forms to do so, including visual art, music, dance, film and spoken word. The music in his pieces draws from the worlds of classical music, movie scores, rock, pop and folk, repositioning works by guitar bands (like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Sonic Youth), singer-songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens and Odetta), and composers (Beethoven, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg). Distinctions between “high” and “low” are a mirage to him. The most enduring of Prina’s sources sit comfortably next to fleeting cultural blips such as Who Let the Dogs Out? Stephen Prina’s accordion. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Petzel Now, for the first time, the full range of Prina’s music-based pieces are on display at MoMA in a retrospective titled A Lick and A Promise. The title echoes an antique phrase that means a job hastily done. In fact, Prina’s works couldn’t be more thoughtfully planned. He chose the title because “big survey or retrospective shows can be intimidating for an audience – and for an artist”, he said. “I felt it needed a modicum of self-deprecation.” That element in his work might not be obvious to everyone, given the density of ideas on display and the sometimes arch construction of his pieces. At the same time, Prina took it as a compliment when a friend recently described one of his string works as “hilarious”. “I’m all for instilling more playfulness in things,” he said, “especially in the domain of art.” In fact, play is central to his work, which commonly involves reinventions of pre-existing pieces. All of the works and performances in the MoMA retrospective involve some act of appropriation. Even the element of chance he introduced to his Mozart-based piece was borrowed, in this case from one of his heroes, John Cage, who memorably composed pieces that involved a throw of the I Ching wands. For Prina, allusions to other works aren’t just inevitable but illuminating. “Every artwork is an act of cultural appropriation whether the artist intends it or not,” he declared. “Unfortunately, a lot of people are gunning to demote any act of appropriation as not being ‘original’. In fact, there are no original thoughts. Nothing happens in a vacuum.” Instead, he sees his work “as seizing upon a cultural product that’s already in circulation in the culture. Then I treat it in some way and re-release back into the culture,” he said. “I feel that connects me to something bigger than the relatively autonomous world of the art object.” According to the curator of the retrospective, Stuart Comer, one of the reasons MoMA wanted to mount the show to begin with was because the museum had already showcased other artists who work intimately with appropriation, including Barbara Kruger, Louise Lawler and Christopher Williams. However, “most of those artists deal with photographic appropriation”, Comer said. “Prina is doing something really different by working with sound and music. More, he began doing so during the rise of hip-hop and sample culture, which connects his work to something broader.” Because Prina himself performs covers and original works in some of the presentations, he sometimes likens his work to performance art. Some critics have also tried to categorize him as a conceptual artist, a tag that makes him bristle. “I owe a big debt to that movement,” he said, “but I always like to say, ‘I’m too young for it.’” (He’s 70).

Photograph: Maria Baranova / Museum of Modern Art, New York Instead, Prina prefers to label his art “post-conceptual”, an approach that uses ideas as a foundational part of the piece while elaborating them with the physical experience of the objects he creates or varies. The term “post-conceptual” came into use in the early 70s through the artist John Baldessari who taught at the California Institute of the Arts where Prina went to school in the 80s. Though Prina grew up in the small midwest town of Galesburg, Illinois, he was lucky enough to encounter avant-garde musical influences as a teenager when some local kids in his neighborhood began improbably roaming the streets reciting lyrics from Captain Beefheart songs. “I ended up being in bands with at least two of those people,” Prina said with a laugh. He studied music and art at Northern Illinois University before going to Cal Arts for his MFA. In the 1980s he taught at Artcenter College of Design in Pasadena where, in the 90s, he taught a class on Keanu Reeves, a move that would barely bat an eye in today’s academia where even Harvard offers a class on Taylor Swift. Back when Prina did it, though, pearls were clutched. “The Los Angeles Times accused me of being a primary agent in the deterioration of higher education,” he said. “Secretly, I found that flattering.” He began showing his work in museums during the 80s and started teaching at Harvard in 2004. (He recently retired from that post.) His Mozart piece, cheekily titled String Quartet for Six Players, conceived in 1976 when he was 21, represents the oldest of his works in the retrospective. One of the most elaborate, and certainly the loudest, piece, dating from 1992, called Beat of the Traps, focuses on the core of popular music – the beat. A multi-disciplinary piece, Beat comprises dance, spoken word monologues, live drummers and a performance by Prina of whatever song topped the Billboard chart that week. That last component references a separate piece he created that’s also on display at MoMA titled The Top Thirteen Singles from Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles Chart for the Week Ending September 11, 1993. For that piece, he tricked up a giant clock to chime on the hour with one of the top hits of that week, including songs by artists ranging from Janet Jackson to Soul Asylum. Prina calls the work “a monument to the ephemeral”, a description that nails one of pop’s central ironies. While pop can be fleeting – yesterday’s top hits might be forgotten tomorrow – it’s also eternal because, Prina said, “once something is out there in the culture, it’s always out there”. Stephen Prina - The Top Thirteen Singles from Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles Chart for the Week Ending 11 September 1993. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Petzel, New York Comer thinks there’s a parallel between Prina’s use of Top 10 hits and MoMA’s mission. “Our identity is based on building the canon of modern art, which is like creating a Top 10,” he said. “At the same time, Stephen is playing with the idea of hierarchies to form an institutional critique through his work.” The monologues in Beat, written by Prina’s collaborator in the piece, the late artist and punk rocker Mike Kelley, were inspired by four of rock’s heaviest drummers – Keith Moon of the Who, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Paul Whaley of Blue Cheer and Mitch Miller of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The monologues, read by an actor, comprise disjointed elements of the drummers’ work and personae. “It’s almost as though you’re looking at the desktop of someone who’s doing research on rock music,” Prina said. “These are your notes before you commit to the final essay.” In the piece, the drummers play various patterns from the stars’ recordings, culminating in Bonham’s part from Led Zeppelin’s When the Levee Breaks. Only in this case, the drummers play a beat out of sync from each other and their snares have been tuned slightly differently. “I think that would drive John Bonham crazy,” Prina said with a laugh. Much like his Mozart piece, Beat takes elements of a canonized work and pulls them apart like strands of yarn from a sweater. The move means to make listeners more aware of every component of a classic, in the process encouraging closer listening. The result also has an element of protest by countering the age of social media, which has made us less attentive than ever. More, the mutations in the piece force listeners to take a more active role in the music as they try to make sense of its new shape. “Marcel Duchamp famously said that the artwork is not completed in the artist’s studio,” said Prina. “It’s complete when it meets the spectator.” To physicalize that point, the Mozart performance I caught featured a reprise in which the musicians repositioned themselves behind the audience where they took a second run at the piece. In puzzled reaction, the audience slowly began to turn their chairs around, making us virtual collaborators in the piece. Not that everyone always chooses to do so. In one instance, Prina said, an audience member wouldn’t turn his chair around and, so, wound up staring directly into the face of the person who had been in front of him. “It created a whole new drama!” the artist said. At one point during the Mozart performance, the conductor fumbled the die, sending it hurling towards the floor, in the process adding an extra level of randomness. “The conductor was mortified,” said Prina. “I was delighted!” Another key element in his pieces fosters rediscovery through the use of jarring juxtapositions. In his piece Sonic Dan , he brings together works by Sonic Youth and Steely Dan by performing covers from each. “People have asked me, incredulously ‘How do these things come together?’” Prina said. “I say, they come together in me .” Given the daunting number of allusions in his survey, it’s unlikely that any individual listener will get all of them. That doesn’t bother the artist in the least. “Even I don’t get all of my references,” Prina said. “I think that’s good. As a kid, I was always drawn to whatever I didn’t understand. Some people get angry at that, but I just thought, ‘what an interesting proposition?’ At the end of the day, isn’t that what all artwork is about? Each piece is a proposition on how to think and live in the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/15/stephen-prina-musuem-of-modern-art-retrospective,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc68cb805c5d8328d477f8b6efe1c9d47e968918/196_0_1667_1334/master/1667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=010675ee51e31c284cbc697a698ad960",2025-10-15T09:03:32+00:00,ebb51f0ba73f61744a3536ce18edf5d2c9869d46
38cca8f2cf68,Adolescence star Stephen Graham launches global project asking fathers to write to their sons,,"Stephen Graham, the Emmy-winning actor best known for Netflix hit Adolescence , has launched a new project asking fathers to write letters to their sons about what it means to be a man, to form a book about masculinity. The project invites fathers around the world to write personal letters to their sons, reflecting on their experiences of fatherhood. Graham will work with psychology lecturer Orly Klein to compile Letters to Our Sons, a book due to be published by Bloomsbury next October. “There is arguably an even bigger disconnect between fathers and sons than ever before,” Graham said. “We want to hear from men of all ages, first-time fathers, absent fathers, fathers who’ve been there but never truly been there, fathers who’ve lost and fathers who just want to find a way to say I love you, to tell their sons what they mean to them and to talk openly about what it means to be a man.” Fathers can submit their letters from Wednesday 15 October until 12 January 2026, via the project’s website . Selected letters will appear alongside contributions from Graham and other well-known figures. The project follows the success of Adolescence, a limited TV series co-created by Graham. The show, which became Netflix’s second most-watched English-language programme globally , examined modern masculinity and the pressures facing teenage boys in a digital world. “After Adolescence, I realised how little space there often is for fathers and sons to talk openly about what it means to be a man today,” Graham said. The series sparked widespread debate in the UK and beyond about the role of fathers, male role models and toxic online influences. MP Anneliese Midgley urged for it to be shown in parliament and in schools, arguing that it could help address violence against women and girls. Prime minister Keir Starmer supported the proposal, saying that watching the show with his teenage children “hit home hard”. On 31 March, it was announced that the series would be made available for free to UK secondary schools. The idea for the book also grew out of Klein’s own experiment: when her son turned 13, she asked her male friends to write him letters offering advice about growing into adulthood. She talked about this with a mutual friend of Graham’s, who then put them in touch, knowing “there was an idea for a book there somewhere”. Klein, whose academic work focuses on marginalisation, identity and youth culture, has previously worked on projects such as Room to Rant, which uses rap as a therapeutic tool for young men. Campaigners and educators have warned of the growing influence of “manosphere” figures and extremist ideologies targeting vulnerable young men. Earlier this year, a study found that 69% of boys aged 11-14 had encountered posts promoting misogyny. Meanwhile, research from the NSPCC found that 42% of parents reported hearing their sons make inappropriate comments – including sexual, violent or degrading remarks – about women and girls, because of what they had seen online. skip past newsletter promotion Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The Australian pop singer, full name Sia Furler , split from Daniel Bernad – the father of their 18-month-old son, Somersault, in May and filed for divorce after three years of marriage. Now the former radiation oncologist has requested the sum, as well as $US300,000 for legal fees and another $US200,000 to cover the cost of forensic accounting. According to court documents filed in Los Angeles , Bernad claimed he has been left with no income after he stopped working in his regular job in 2021 to open a ketamine treatment clinic with Sia. The former couple formed a company, Modern Medicine, in 2022 but the documents alleged Sia stopped funding the venture in March. Her estranged husband hasn’t received a salary since then, despite an alleged agreement for him to continue in the business until July. The former medic requested the huge spousal support figure in order to maintain the “luxurious and upper-class lifestyle” he had enjoyed with Sia, which included over $US400,000 in monthly expenses for private jets, vacations, high-end dining and several full-time members of staff. “We never needed to monitor our living expenses,” he wrote. “I request that the court order Sia to pay me temporary spousal support in the sum of $250,856 per month. “Orders are necessary at this time because I am financially dependent on Sia, the breadwinner in our marriage. I have no income and Sia has ceased all funding for Modern Medicine. Sia has the ability to pay me spousal support to maintain our financial status quo.” Bernad stated he will “need to complete several years of training and pass several rigorous exams before I can renew my certification and practice radiation oncology again.” He also claimed his request for the money to cover his legal and accounting fees will “level the playing field” between himself and his estranged wife. Around the time the Cheap Thrills singer filed for divorce, Bernad claimed she paid for him to live in a hotel until the end of July, before he moved into his current home. He has paid more than $US100,000 to lease the property for a year but alleged in his court documents that Sia – who also has two adopted teenage sons – refused his request to reimburse him for the cost.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/15/sia-divorce-estranged-husband-dan-bernad-spousal-support,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4f3ec0e40b132cdf0abee0f30888b2893dfc7e/355_3_2912_2331/master/2912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9360a355f4ed436660d6bc53660d45ea",2025-10-15T03:19:23+00:00,b11b57476b0592ac455dcf39a365a0bc6a68bb3a
0699c1e4851c,"Drew Struzan, poster designer for Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, dies aged 78",,"Designer Drew Struzan, known for some of the most iconic movie posters of all time, has died aged 78. His work included posters for films such as Back to the Future, The Empire Strikes Back, The Goonies, The Shawshank Redemption, The Thing and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. “It is with a heavy heart that I must tell you that Drew Struzan has moved on from this world as of yesterday, October 13th,” a statement on his official Instagram account read. “I feel it is important that you all know how many times he expressed to me the joy he felt knowing how much you appreciated his art.” Struzan began his career designing album covers for artists including the Beach Boys, the Bee Gees, Earth, Wind & Fire, Liberace and Black Sabbath. His cover for Alice Cooper’s Welcome to My Nightmare was named one of the greatest ever by Rolling Stone. He started work on film posters in the 1970s with mostly B-movies before he created a secondary poster for the theatrical re-release of Star Wars. He then became one of the most sought-after designers of the decade and by the 1980s he was working on about 10 a year. “I had to do something different, and I think that the trouble with a lot of early movie posters is that they looked too much like classic illustration, which feels like it’s telling the whole story,” he said in a 2021 interview . “I didn’t want to do that. I felt that art was more than just telling the story. In fact, telling the story in a poster is wrong for a movie. I wasn’t looking to tell a story. I’m looking to give a person a feeling about something they could hope for.” He often worked with Steven Spielberg creating the designs for ET: The Extra Terrestrial, Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom and Hook among others. He also designed posters for Blade Runner, Big Trouble in Little China, Coming to America, First Blood, Hellboy and the American poster for Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. In March of this year, his wife shared that he had Alzheimer’s in a Facebook post . “Drew can no longer paint or sign things for you,” she wrote. “He is not enjoying a well-deserved retirement but rather fighting for his life.” Tributes are pouring in from the industry, including the DC Comics chief Jim Lee who called him “a giant among giants” and added: “His work captured the humanity, power and emotion of his subjects in ways not seen since.

2ed897ed501e,Murdaugh: Death in the Family review – Patricia Arquette is fantastic in this obscene true-crime drama,,"H ow fascinatingly horrible were the Murdaugh family? Very, according to how much true-crime content they’ve generated. There’s already been a hit podcast about them, untangling a narrative that began in enviable luxury and ended with a sordid double murder. There’s already been a TV documentary. Now the Murdaughs complete the set with Murdaugh: Death in the Family, the plush fictionalised drama retelling the same awful tale. At its heart is a trio of strong performances, primed for awards season. Jason Clarke – also currently excellent as a different kind of alpha male in The Last Frontier on Apple TV+ – is Richard Alexander “Alex” Murdaugh, a powerhouse personal injury attorney and member of a South Carolina dynasty whose men have been the biggest beasts in the courtroom for generations. Over the years, the Murdaughs – their name looks like “murder” but is pronounced “Murdoch” – have built up a network of acolytes who owe them a living or a favour. Their legal acumen and wealth, combined with a gangster-ish propensity for exploitation and bullying, give them a level of impunity that Alex blithely pushes to its limit. Patricia Arquette is Alex’s wife Maggie, who worries that both his philandering and his opioid addiction have returned – and on the second point at least, she is correct. Edging out his more established co-stars to deliver the best characterisation of all is Johnny Berchtold as Alex and Maggie’s son, Paul, who is only just reaching the end of his teens but already looks irretrievable. An alcoholic whose beer-chugging has a desperate mania about it, Paul is infuriated by his father’s dismissive labelling of him as the family screw-up, an insult to which he habitually reacts by proving Pops right. Corroded by power and money … Johnny Berchtold as Paul Murdaugh. Photograph: Daniel Delgado Jr/Disney Paul is almost catatonic with drunken self-hatred as, in 2019, he takes some friends out on a speedboat at night, ignoring their fearful screams as the craft goes faster. It hits a bridge, killing one of the group. As Alex tries to ensure Paul gets away with it, Maggie sees her son’s guilt slowly turn to psychosis, and local news reporter Mandy Matney (Brittany Snow, playing the real journalist whose podcast inspired this drama) kicks back against the media’s unwillingness to take on the Murdaughs, the clan’s fragile armour begins to fracture. As a psychoanalysis of a family where every relationship has been poisoned by the cruelty of the patriarch and further corroded by power and money, Death in the Family is thorough. Whether it’s a meeting with an impoverished immigrant family hoping for a life-changing compensation payout, a family dinner on a Bahamas holiday, or a staring match against the bathroom mirror, any interaction a Murdaugh participates in is a lie, a shakedown, or a display of dominance. The portrait of a certain stripe of white, southern capitalist, their folksy straight-talking barely concealing that every fight they’ve ever won has been rigged, is unsparing. As is the depiction of the American civil law system as a game where aggressive negotiating and dodgy insurance claims turn life, loss and happiness into commodities – all anyone cares about is the size of the settlement figure. It is obscene, even before Alex starts swindling his clients out of their cash. The issue for Death in the Family as a drama is why viewers would want to put themselves through it. Eight long episodes loom, promising a more extensive examination of, or speculation about, every aspect of the Murdaughs’ cursed lives than a documentary would offer. Alex and Maggie’s marriage is rotten, their parenting is rotten, their son’s soul is rotten. Their business empire is a rotten edifice of bribes and shady accounting. By the time the show starts hinting at a bad outcome for devout housekeeper Gloria (Kathleen Wilhoite), whose status as a beloved unofficial family member does not mean that the Murdaughs do anything to lift her out of exhausting poverty, you may wish to spiral downwards with them no further: the cocktail of disgust, schadenfreude and sadness becomes bitter. Arquette is the show’s heart, as much as it has one, as the woman who has married into all this and who can’t be the loving wife and fierce mother she wants to be because the Murdaugh menfolk can’t accommodate that. But it’s hard to place her: she’s too aware of her situation to be a tragically deluded victim, and too powerless to qualify as a co-conspirator we can despise. The Murdaughs are atrocious in so many different ways, it’s difficult to maintain a useful understanding of all of them at once. However well made and performed Death in the Family is, it prompts the same question as so much other true-crime telly: why am I making myself watch?",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/15/murdaugh-death-in-the-family-review-disney-patricia-arquette-true-crime-drama,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3299b4c1f0cedf7102fe54aa4cd1d6e691b6c07/274_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce21066ce878b7a3a447eba0040c6c4b",2025-10-15T04:00:13+00:00,f3e90d9f9ebe5cb007229ebf59201576dd239836
4393f50d207f,The Twits review – Americanised Roald Dahl is gruesome in all the wrong ways,,"T his animated Netflix adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Twits is only fractionally less gruelling than eating wormy spaghetti or finding a toad stuffed in the bottom of your bed. Dahl’s story about one of the most dysfunctional marriages in fiction is not exactly burdened with plot: the 95-page original is essentially a series of mean pranks, all monstrously mangled here and tortuously added to. There has been some outrage that Netflix have Americanised the story, but that is the least of this film’s problems. In the fictional city of Triperot, Mrs Twit (voiced by Margo Martindale) is a Texan in blue denim cowboy boots, unhappily married to Mr Twit (Johnny Vegas, keeping his Lancashire accent). The couple have built a rickety amusement park called Twitlandia, with rides made out of toilets and old mattresses, all powered by the magical tears of the Muggle-Wump monkeys. When authorities close down the amusement park on the grounds of health and safety, the gruesome twosome go to war with the city. The story is flabbier than Mr Twit’s tum-tum, which is a shame since it was produced, directed and co-written by Phil Johnston whose previous credits include clever and imaginative family animations such as Wreck-it Ralph and Zootopia . In an appalling mangling of Dahl’s story, the Twits flood the city with rancid hotdog meat before deciding to run for mayor. And ordinary working people are suckered in by the Twits’ pledge to make Triperot great again, in a frankly age-inappropriate satirising of the current state of politics. Any of Dahl’s gruesome sense of fun is obliterated by a bulldozing message of empathy and kindness, thanks to a plucky orphan Beesha (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and her pals pulling together an opposition to the Twits.

a4578c3bb63a,Finding My Way by Malala Yousafzai review – growing up in public,,"L ying in her Birmingham hospital bed in the weeks after she’d been shot in the head by a Taliban assassin, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai used to imagine the conversation she would have with Taliban leadership. “If they would just sit down with me … I could reason with them and convince them to end their reign of misogyny and violence,” she writes in her new memoir . Malala kept a notebook by her bed, filled with rhetorical strategies and talking points – the names of journalists who might be able to broker a meeting with the Taliban, the Qur’an verses she could cite to show that girls do have a right to education in Islam, the things she could say to establish her own credentials as a God-fearing Muslim. Of course, that conversation never happened. Much later, after the fall of Afghanistan in 2021, it made her wince to recall her naive belief that the Taliban would ever listen to her. What did happen is that, little by little, Malala grew up. She’s told her story before, most notably in I Am Malala , co-written with Christina Lamb and published in 2013, the year before she won a Nobel peace prize. Finding My Way picks up the story of her life as she navigates young adulthood. In Birmingham, her secondary school classmates largely ignore her, but Malala studies hard and wins a place at Oxford – a dream come true. She joins the rowing team, signs up for a plethora of clubs, and stays out late dancing with her roommates, all while keeping up with the international speaking engagements that pay her parents’ mortgage. She has little time to do any reading, let alone turn in assignments on time. Her tutors send her increasingly stern letters. But she does find time to fall in love. Central to the book is the story of Malala’s tender courtship with Asser, a handsome cricket executive from Lahore. When she develops a passing interest in astronomy, he buys her a telescope. When she tells a national magazine she’s sceptical about the institution of marriage, he gets on the phone with her irate parents to back her up and talk them down. Malala takes a long time to conclude she’s ready for marriage, but when she finally takes the plunge, it brings her “profound happiness”. Good for her. The clarity of Malala’s childhood conviction that girls have an unassailable right to be educated is what thrust her on to the international stage, but it’s also what, for a time, took away her ability to define herself. When she woke up from a coma after she was attacked, her face was half-paralysed, but even more disconcertingly, her real-life identity, as a mischievous classmate and annoying sister, had been overwritten by the narrative of a “mythical heroine, virtuous and dutiful” – “a serious and shy girl, a wallflower forced to speak out when the Taliban took away her books”. It was an impossible sainthood. Meanwhile, an army of online trolls found her every move reprehensibly un-Islamic. Finding My Way sees Malala wresting back the story of her own life – rejecting the constrictions and contradictions of a sheltered childhood and sudden fame. At Oxford, she gives her security guards the slip to climb the Lady Margaret Hall bell tower. She celebrates Galentines day with her girlfriends. She finds a therapist to address her PTSD. She falls perilously behind on her work, then slowly cultivates more studious habits. She even goes through a phase of constantly ordering TGI Fridays ribs, not realising they’re pork (whoops). It’s all an education. These days, on her Instagram stories, you can find Malala in a bucket hat, nodding along to Oasis performing Roll With It, Asser grinning by her side. The work of advocating for girls’ education around the world is still part of her life, but so, too, are more quotidian joys: she has a quirky pen collection she’s proud of, she boasts a mean golf swing, and she’s trying to learn how to swim. It turns out that being a student of life can be a worthy vocation, too. skip past newsletter promotion Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

8f2c39dfff71,"The Chair Company review – an office rage comedy packed with massive, stupid laughs",,"M eet Ron Trosper, a faithful office grunt in small town Ohio. Ron works for a company that builds shopping malls, and their latest one is the first for which Ron has been made project lead, despite some of his superiors’ misgivings. Today is his big day. He’s giving a speech at the launch! Ron is the creation of Tim Robinson, the former Saturday Night Live writer/performer who reinvented the American sketch show in 2019 with I Think You Should Leave . In a new half-hour, eight-episode series that starts as a workplace comedy before sprawling into mystery/thriller territory, his alter ego is a stock Robinson character, a variation on the textbook comic protagonist who has to bear the burden of being the only sane man in every room. Ron is genuinely beset by absurdity, misfortune and other people’s idiocy and selfishness, but always manages to react in a way that makes everyone around him conclude that he is the problem. Whereas Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm met the world’s small annoyances in a rational but insensitive manner, Ron combats them irrationally and too sensitively. The opening scene sets the tone: Ron is quite rightly vexed by a waitress crassly hovering over the family’s table while his wife, Barb (Lake Bell), is trying to raise a toast to him. But by the time Ron has finished speaking to the young woman, he has got into a ridiculous argument caused by his refusal to accept that she never shops in malls, and has too aggressively insisted on boxing up half a devilled egg to take home. Later on, in the silent middle of the night, a restless Ron raises his head, irritated by something else now: “I swear I have the worst pillow in town!” Like Larry David but way more irrational … Tim Robinson as Ron Trosper in The Chair Company. Photograph: HBO/Warner Robinson’s followers will be able to hear him say that line in their heads, or the one where he overemotes at how nice the restaurant food looks: “This is ssssstunning!!” Countless amateur comedians on YouTube and TikTok have borrowed that manic, suddenly shouting intonation, but without nailing character details as carefully as Robinson does. Everything his fans would expect in a leading man is present as Ron, hunched and forever hyperventilating, prowls from one embarrassment to another in his crap suit, squinting through unflattering glasses, fingermarked and askew. Of course, Ron’s big presentation goes haywire, via a moment of roaringly well-executed slapstick that causes our friend to embark on a truly wild crusade against a negligent office-chair manufacturer. The overarching story, in which Ron’s obsessive persistence leads him to become entangled in a strange conspiracy – there are hints of Only Murders in the Building in the way the narrative is unafraid to unfurl haphazardly, while director Andrew DeYoung sometimes films Robinson as if he is in a paranoid 1970s movie thriller – might be more ambitious than the traditional office comedy, but both are ideal vehicles for Robinson’s comic gifts. Aside from embodying pure cringeworthy rage in his performance, as a writer Robinson is – along with regular collaborator Zach Kanin – brilliant at making supporting or one-off characters and situations just that little bit more extreme than an average comedy would think appropriate. If the script has the need for a shop assistant who acts oddly, or a cafe owner too busy to answer Ron’s questions, or an unhelpful customer service operator who knows nothing about the business they represent, Robinson and Kanin make sure the interaction has the unforgettable unpredictability and intensity of an I Think You Should Leave skit. All comedy is essentially about surprises and in The Chair Company, you can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming. Ron’s colleagues are just the right amount of wacky, too, from the janitor jealously guarding his wheelbarrow to Ron’s nemesis, a kindly older co-worker who has stopped taking his career seriously and starting blowing bubbles across the room during important meetings. The test of whether The Chair Company turns out to be great or just very good will be Robinson’s ability to sustain himself across a longer, more narrative-driven format. Episodes of his hilarious but exhausting sketch show ran to just 15 minutes. There are positive early signs: beneath all the goofing are tender hints that Ron is acting out because his two kids are growing up and he is worried that he is now too old to achieve anything, but we can see that his wife and kids don’t agree that he’s a loser and that they are his big achievement. So can Ron take Robinson to the next level? To borrow a phrase from one of his unanswered emails to the chair people: “I look very forward” to finding out.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/13/the-chair-company-review-tim-robinson-office-rage-comedy-massive-stupid-laughs,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b519fac6e880c7b17401d9274c598f8eb5c36f/992_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d0b62c0958eae1650dae030ea2c765b1",2025-10-13T21:25:01+00:00,9cadea110b842bae020a7fd695974c07f21fa8a1

d887b532eae8,"Delivery swans, millionaire neighbours and the wonders of a bath: hardcore houseboaters celebrated in photos",,"‘M aria was actually due to give birth on that boat,” says Aisha Mirza with a half sigh, half laugh. “We were all excited, but she ended up starting labour early and having the baby in the hospital. Then she brought the baby to the boat and I got to photograph their first few days together. That was really special.” Mirza, an artist and writer, is speaking via Zoom, sitting outside on a bench on a sunny autumn day talking me through some of the photographs in their new exhibition and smiling. WWWADING, is a five-year culmination of photography and oral history collected along the canals of London with a focus on boaters of colour. Inspired by the idea of what they call “a marginalised people choosing a marginalised way of life”, the photographs are an ode to a community of queer or disabled boaters in their natural habitat, who don’t often have a lens on their existence. A tender moment of communion … a boater doing someone’s hair. Photograph: Aisha Mirza Mirza is half Pakistani and Egyptian (and a boater) and talks about how water is a part of their present and ancestral history. “One of the things that unites a lot of black and brown people is that we have movement in our lineages. Whether that’s violent displacement, migration, economic movement, we’ve all sailed on seas to get here and end up on this strange land. So it felt obvious that communities of colour occupying these spaces would be explored.” Mirza started asking boaters unusual questions. How has water shown up in the history of your family? How do boats inform how you live now? “One person I was interviewing was like: ‘Well, the British build canals. That’s what they do.’” The idea of colonial capitalism carved into the earth via watery networks gives the work a critical edge. “It’s considered an incredible feat of engineering despite facilitating colonialism and control through commerce and capitalism. Large areas of marshland were destroyed to build these and land never recovers.” The name WWWADING elicits ideas of watery struggle and the web, which puts us in a modern world, despite our desire to escape it at times. Mirza describes wanting to be as close to off-grid living as you can in a city. “When I first moved on to a boat, I was saying I was off grid as a joke until I realised that people living on boats in London are for the most part not tapped into any of the main grid systems. For constant cruisers, like me, who move my boat every two weeks, we’re managing our own water, we’re creating our own electricity, using solar power and gas from bottles. It’s quite hardcore.” The pictures speak to how people are using home-making as an act of resistance against the high costs of London living. From the inclusion of mobility scooters on boats to signs declaring “THE TRUTH IS IN THE SOIL” (“I heard there’s one that says Compost The Rich, but I couldn’t find it”) or display pieces of Indian and Pakistani flags kissing. One photograph captures a boater on a towpath doing someone’s hair in a tender show of communion; another is of a boater, Esme, eating a Pot Noodle. “She makes ceramics using clay foraged from the towpath,” says Mirza. “She has this tiny boat and she has an enormous dog on it. It’s as big as her.” There’s humour in the shots too. “There’s two swans who’ve swum up to my front door – and you can see an Amazon box.” ‘Her dog is as big as she is’ … Esme and her four-legged friend. Photograph: Aisha Mirza One photograph captures a person in a “Boaters Fightback” T-shirt, referencing a growing movement to resist the government’s support of privatisation of land around the waterways. “The canals used to be a place of working-class labour, but now they’re a place of waterfront views and million-pound flats,” sighs Mirza. “Residents overlooking the beautiful waterways of London don’t necessarily want to see poor people living in boats.” skip past newsletter promotion Your weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitions Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re silent for a moment thinking of how we all navigate political, social, cultural pollution – and suddenly Mirza smiles and we discuss the bath picture and how people create glimmers of sun for themselves. “She just looks so beautiful with her gaze and being really present,” they say happily. “For a moment, you forget the capitalist real estate treadmill – and you’re given these moments.

783e1c55f5ad,Andrew Coates obituary,,"My father, Andrew Coates, who has died aged 86, had a professional life in three acts: as a technical illustrator in the aviation sector, as a technical adviser to lighthouse keepers and as a teacher. Andrew had been born completely deaf, and so each of those work paths had their challenges. But perhaps his greatest achievements were outside the workplace. In his 20s he became one of the first deaf people in Britain to fly a glider, and he spent countless happy hours on the airfield and in the sky, making 1,500 flights over the next six decades. He also wrote a book, Jane’s World Sailplanes and Motor Gliders, which became a standard reference work in the field. Andrew was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire , to Geoffrey, a shipping clerk, and Anne (nee Newlands), a nursery school worker. At five he was sent to a boarding school where staff refused to use sign language and hit him frequently, but thankfully his secondary education at Tewin Water school for the deaf, in Tewin, Hertfordshire, was a much happier experience. Jane’s World Sailplanes and Motor Gliders, by Andrew Coates, published in 1979 As a teenager he began an apprenticeship in 1955 with the De Havilland aircraft company, and in the pre-computer age excelled at producing by hand 3D drawings showing the workings of aeroplanes. He continued as a technical illustrator for the company until 1972, when he took on a similar role for RAF Strike Command in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, for a year, and then for two years at Hawker Siddeley Aviation in north London . While working in all those jobs he had an unofficial sideline creating cartoons, posters and maps that were often printed in aviation magazines. The switch into the world of lighthouses came in 1975, when Andrew joined Trinity House, the authority managing lighthouses, as a technical expert producing maintenance manuals and instruction guides for lighthouse keepers. In that role he would travel to lighthouses all around England, staying in each one for a few days to create instruction manuals for the keepers before moving on to the next, often by helicopter. In his 40s he changed track again to become a teacher of sign language in London, first at the City Lit adult education college in Holborn (1981-88) and then at Wealdstone College in Harrow (1988-89) before working freelance at various colleges from 1989 to 1991. The last phase of his career was seen out at the Frank Barnes school for deaf children in Swiss Cottage, teaching sign language to staff and pupils. He worked there until retiring in 2004. After stopping flying in old age, Andrew tried golf, but lasted just 15 minutes before texting his wife, Christine (nee Russell), to say: “Come and get me now, it’s boring.” He had met Chris when she attended a sign language class he was teaching, and they married in 1985. An attentive husband, though never a great romantic, on a subsequent work trip, after he observed colleagues buying chocolates and perfumes for their spouses, he decided to choose and wrap a gift for Chris, too: a tin opener. He is survived by Chris and their children, Laura and me, and grandchildren, Eva, Jordan and Max.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/15/andrew-coates-obituary,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d500c49f281c93cd34d7978b168416bf3769da/0_269_1284_1027/master/1284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e8df3bdedb1a04594f27a205a096ca4",2025-10-15T16:32:47+00:00,0272d15abaa4a1e75a5af9e6f3c1c506691870ef
7febaefbe710,"After 40 years as an autistic person in the workplace, I realised it was OK to ask for changes",,"A lthough I started my first full-time job when I was 15, it was more than three decades before I asked for an accommodation at work. This was not because I didn’t want or need changes in my workplace. I had struggled with aspects of the workplace since my first job at the age of 15. I knew that the bright lights in my office and in meeting rooms made it difficult to concentrate and gave me severe migraines. I knew that the artificial air blowing through the air conditioning vents caused my skin to itch and made me feel ill. I knew that I struggled to shut out the background noise and focus on important conversations. But the idea that it didn’t have to be that way – or that it wasn’t that way for everyone else – was beyond my imagination. It was my gradual realisation that the struggles my autistic children experienced in the world mirrored my own, and my subsequent autism diagnosis at the age of 50 that made me realise my colleagues did not experience the workplace in the way that I did. But I accepted if I wanted to work, I had to tolerate being in a workplace that was doing me harm. Working in Melbourne during the Covid-19 lockdowns was an absolute game-changer for me, as it was for many autistic (and non-autistic) people. My home town was famous for being the most locked-down city in the world, with 262 days of restrictions that included “work from home where possible”. For the first time in the 17 years since I commenced in a leadership role, I wasn’t exhausted at the end of each day. I actually had enough energy to eat dinner with my family, to watch television with my husband in the evenings and to go for a walk with my sons on the weekend. I also got more work done than I had in years. My health began to improve. I felt calm, relaxed and happy. I was enjoying my work and I had remembered how to laugh. I was absolutely dreading the return to “normal”. Almost a year of working from home had given me a really clear sense, for the first time, of what it actually was that I found so challenging and exhausting about my job (and it wasn’t the work). It was the ongoing sensory challenges of bright lights, humming air conditioners and photocopiers, room temperature that I had no control over, clothes with seams and collars that itched and distracted. It was the constant social interaction, from endless meetings to small talk in the kitchen, always worrying whether I had properly interpreted the nuances of the conversation or misread a social cue. It was the ever-present need to mask my natural way of being to fit in; constantly reminding myself not to fidget, to make eye contact, not to speak or move or act in a way that was different to my neurotypical colleagues. Prof Sandra Thom-Jones, author of Austistics at Work. Photograph: Melbourne University Press Then, after almost 40 years in the workplace, I decided to ask for workplace accommodations. At the time I was working in a senior leadership position in a university, a role that required me to undertake a range of strategic planning tasks (which I felt comfortable with) and attend countless meetings and events (which I found exhausting). Finally I knew that I could ask; I had delivered numerous professional development training sessions where I had taught other managers about the importance of providing reasonable adjustments for autistic staff. I wasn’t afraid to ask; one week back in the office after 10 months working at home had shown me that the risks to my wellbeing of not asking were far more serious. And I knew exactly what I was going to ask for: all the things I had established in my work environment and routine when I had control over it that had enabled me to maintain my physical and mental wellbeing, and at the same time be considerably more productive. I was fortunate to be in a career that allowed me to have a reasonable amount of flexibility in my working arrangements and conditions, and to be in a sufficiently senior position to be able to control many aspects of my immediate work environment. Not everyone is in this situation. Some of the changes I made to my workspace were having dimmer switches installed in my office, having the air-conditioning vent disconnected, dimming the screen on my computer, purchasing a folding screen to go around my desk, getting a comfy reading chair in my favourite colour, and bringing fidget toys into my office. Some of the changes I made to my working conditions were wearing sunglasses or a cap when meeting in other people’s offices or meeting rooms, ensuring that my dietary needs were considered in catering for meetings and work functions, and negotiating to work from home two days per week. While some of my colleagues were initially surprised by the changes to my ways of working, they were largely accepting. What helped was having the words to explain why these adjustments were necessary and the support of my direct manager and my team. The visibility of my work adjustments, as a senior leader in the organisation, also empowered other autistic and neurodivergent staff to request the adjustments they needed. In my experience, it is useful to express the outcomes in terms of the benefits to both yourself and the organisation. For example, in my case: “The fluorescent lights in my office make it extremely difficult for me to focus on my work, and also give me intense headaches. Replacing lights will mean that I am able to focus on my work, be much more productive, and have fewer sick days due to light-induced migraines.” While some workplace adjustments require employers to invest in building modifications or purchase equipment, many reasonable adjustments can be implemented at minimal or no cost. They require simply that supervisors and colleagues are more understanding of the fact that autistic people experience the world differently from non-autistic people. For me, the biggest improvements in my wellbeing at work came from knowing that my colleagues accepted the ways that I needed to work – that I could wear my sunglasses in brightly lit rooms, wear my headphones in shared working spaces or excuse myself from a meeting if I was feeling overwhelmed. I would like to say that all of my colleagues were accepting of these changes, but the reality is that some were not. Many autistic people face barriers due to stereotypes and ableist assumptions, including the belief that the neurotypical way of working is the only right way. Every workplace, like every autistic person, is different; the challenges experienced and adjustments required will vary. However, the starting point for all workplaces is a genuine commitment to understanding the needs of autistic employees, and a willingness to create spaces where we can all work safely and comfortably.

6d65985e5932,"A new dream man has dropped – the laid-back, confident beefcake",,"H ow do you like your men? Yes, obviously , we shouldn’t be dismissively taxonomising a whole gender like boxed Barbies. But in the era of tradwives and nu-gen gold diggers , in which the manosphere remains alive and kick(box)ing, telling teenage boys lies about women, I reckon there’s a way to go before we reach reductive objectification parity. Does that make it OK? No. Am I going to do it anyway? Yes, a bit. So, returning to the question, my answer is “like my coffee”: small, strong, dark and highly over-stimulating, brewed by my sister’s boyfriend in Scarborough … No, hang on, this is falling apart. Regardless, my ideal man is wildly at odds with the zeitgeist and my husband needs to punch up his protein intake and stop having opinions, because the New York Times claims a new dream man has dropped and he’s “beefy, placid and … politically ambiguous”. What do we know about the nouveau-neutral hunk? Well, apart from the essential 1:1 neck-to-head ratio and thighs like sequoias, he’s “sweetly naive, simple, almost oafish … unfazed by the byzantine requirements of modern masculinity, largely because he doesn’t know or care that they exist”. Grazia agrees, issuing an appreciation of what it is calling the “ Woke Jock ”: “As unremittingly blokey as he’s gentle”, the Woke Jock is comfortable with vulnerability and happy to be out-earned. Speaking of out-earning, the original placid beefcake – and the reason, surely, the archetype has merited NYT appraisal – is Mr Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce. I refuse to recognise any under-50 male celebrities – my tiny blow against the patriarchy – so I had to cram the various Chrises, Kelces and Hemsworths to understand this phenomenon, but having done the (bro-appropriate) heavy lifting, I like what I see with Kelce. Built like Oak Furnitureland’s XXL wardrobe aisle, seemingly light on ego despite excelling at whatever a “tight end” does in American football, and touchingly delighted when Swift uses polysyllabic words, Kelce seems comfortable in his own skin in a way that’s very winning. Others include Channing Tatum (lauded for cheerfully telling a story about getting educated on director Akira Kurosawa by a video store employee) and evolved man-mountain Jason Momoa , who has declared: “I embrace the feminine side and also feel like I am OK to be vulnerable.” This is something of a turnaround. You may recall 2024’s “hot rat summer” (I paraphrase) when slight, rodenty men became pin-ups; or our recent collective yearning for the rumpled, thoughtful rizz of “daddy” Pedro Pascal . And we’re still laughing at an entirely different 2025 archetype: the performative male . If you were living under a rock all summer (enviable), let me explain: the much-satirised, tote bag-toting, ostentatiously David Foster Wallace-reading, hojicha-drinking, self-proclaimed feminist performative male is the anti-benign meathead. An over- rather than under-thinker, he’s self-aware to a fault, fashioning himself into what he believes women want – purely, the theory goes, to get into their pants. But apparently women want something quite different now. They’re concluding that Swift is right, as she is about many things: that cartoonish muscles and the ability to bench-press a grizzly bear can make for a partner who wears his masculinity lightly, with an identity that isn’t threatened by a successful, independent woman.

But this anecdote barely registers on the Geiger counter of bigotry in healthcare that Hutchinson writes about trenchantly and acerbically, from the prejudices doctors face from patients and the gender and race blindspots in medical textbooks, to the racism that could endanger a patient’s life ( black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth ). Meeting Hutchinson in the Guardian’s offices in London, he emanates forethought and competence. Even in shorts and a T-shirt, he seems like the kind of guy who couldn’t look scruffy if he tried. He says the book he’s written about race had to be done, but “I’ve spoken to people who are non-white and female, and without even prompting, they’ve said: ‘Actually, the thing that is held more against me is being a woman.’” Hutchinson’s wife, Louise, is a GP. “The lack of respect that can be shown to female doctors is outrageous, sometimes by certain other healthcare professionals, not even patients. In the same way, we haven’t really had a book, as far as I’m aware, about being disabled as a doctor and the lack of access to medical school for someone with a disability. I’ve met only one doctor with a hearing impairment in the entire time I’ve been working.” It’s a curse, being this fair-minded, stepping back from each point to look at every perspective, but it also gives an immediate sense of the kind of doctor he is. It speaks also to the speciality he’s chosen, rheumatology, which perhaps out of any field is the one that can cope with the most mystery: pain without a source. At 38, he is about to become a consultant. Hutchinson also does standup comedy, and his act and the writing ambitions that led to the book are the product of his years working as what used to be called a senior house officer in the NHS – the period before specialising – in the mid-2010s. It’s a time when “you’re becoming senior enough that people expect you to know what you’re doing, yet you’re still getting all the rubbish work. I was just a bit disaffected with medicine, wondering what other things I could do. Eventually, I did some standup, and just really got into it.” His routines started off as a softcore, leftie side-eye at the ridiculousness of politics, parenting, life and everything (Suella Braverman, “the Michael Jordan of multiculturalism”, railing against multiculturalism; Formula One being so white it’s amazing that Lewis Hamilton doesn’t get pulled over on the race track). The skills, he says, aren’t completely dissimilar to medicine: “Trying to get a room full of people on side to believe that you know what you’re doing.” The book is often a sharp-intake-of-breath funny (one medic on a dementia ward called it “veterinary medicine”), but doesn’t play it for laughs. He describes a situation like the grinding suffering of a lupus patient with such a close eye for detail that you feel as if you’re walking alongside him. A key preoccupation at medical school? Not being sent to an area where Reform are suddenly on the rise Hutchinson’s parents were both biochemists, now retired, and his younger brother is an anaesthetist. His dad arrived in Birmingham from Jamaica aged 19; his mother is Scottish. He grew up in south-east London, where he still lives, in an area that has gone from rough-with-leafy-pockets to only-just-affordable-on-two-doctors’-salaries. Not far from Eltham, where Stephen Lawrence was murdered, racism was hardly unheard of, but it wasn’t until Hutchinson went on a camping trip to Cornwall as a teenager that he discovered the unabashed bigotry of rural, monocultural Britain. Some local teenagers tried to pick a fight with him, uttering the bizarrely sinister line: “What are you doing here, dark horse?” The experience stayed with him when he decided to become a doctor, because in your first year of working, the NHS can send you anywhere. “That is one of your key preoccupations, almost from day one at medical school: how do I not get sent away? Even if it’s not being sent very far across the country, even just having to spend a year out of London in a place where suddenly Reform are on the rise, and there are St George crosses appearing everywhere and migrant hotels being burned down, that’s going to be a consideration.” There’s no easy solution – medics used to be placed according to a complex points system; now it’s done by lottery. Both methods have their critics, and “everywhere needs doctors,” Hutchinson says. He’s not trying to land an easy fix, merely noting that in the current environment, where politicians generate racial tension with their euphemistic “concerns about immigration” and endless discussions about whose anger is legitimate, you don’t often hear from the black healthcare professionals who have to go and live in that anger. Hutchinson performing at the Backyard Comedy Club, 2018. Photograph: Steve Cross In the event, he spent his first year in 2012 “at the bottom of that pyramid” (foundation year 1), in Essex. “I don’t think I could do now, as an experienced doctor, what I was asked to do in my first placement,” he says. As the general dogsbody of doctors, FY1s are often the only doctor doing out-of-hours ward cover. “Overnight, you’re the only port of call for about 400 medical beds which, given how sick these people are, is absurd. As a sort of crude estimate, 40 patients might need urgent care. And it’s you, the most junior person, turning up. It’s improved in some places, so you’ll have two registrars on overnight. I would still say the night shift is just doing as little as possible to the people who are already in hospital, to survive until the morning.” Things have changed since more than two decades ago, when junior doctors were famous for the inhuman length of the shifts they had to work; but every solution seems to create a new problem. Shorter shifts with longer rest breaks were phased into the 2016 junior doctors contract in England to accommodate the fact that even medics cannot survive on no sleep. Hutchinson found successive night shifts “very mentally destabilising, I get terrified of the notion of death. I’ve had that since I was 17 or 18, but I don’t think about it unless I’m sleep-deprived.” But despite junior doctors working shorter shifts, no extra staff were magicked up to fill the gap, so the result has been pervasive understaffing. Only during the pandemic, “when everyone got dragged out of elective care and out of clinic” did they suddenly have enough healthcare professionals in urgent care. “It’s probably some of the most well-staffed work I’ve ever done in my entire career,” he says. But there was a flipside, as there always seems to be. “What we’re seeing now is that it was a complete disaster for secondary care. It was then as if no other disease existed. So you found all these people 18 months later in a heap because their rheumatoid arthritis hadn’t been assessed and managed properly.” Cardiology attracts people who can be quite blunt, aggressive and have a high opinion of themselves Hutchinson has some pretty salty views about the other medical specialities, particularly cardiology, which attracts “people who can be quite blunt, aggressive, and have a high opinion of themselves”. His early years, first in Essex, later back in London, are peppered with incidents with cardiologists. Is it a class thing, I ask, considering the conveyor belt he describes: “If you pick your 18-year-old who wants to go to Imperial or Cambridge, most of them want to be brain surgeons, or want to be cardiac surgeons.” But no, “even now that there’s more diversity in the demographic, it’s still quite an aggressive speciality. Behaviour in the past was far worse, but those people haven’t gone away, they’ve just moderated their language. Having said that, I don’t want to give rheumatologists too much of an easy ride – there are plenty of abrupt rheumatologists.” In between surviving till dawn in Essex in his first year, to arriving back in London for his second foundation year – at a hospital he describes as “the kind of well-resourced centre of excellence where pampered professors carve out fiefdoms”, he met his wife at a party of his brother’s. They now have two children, one about to start pre-school, the other four months old. He has enormous respect for the work of GPs like his wife. “It’s such a difficult job, the idea that you can be expected to work out what’s a cold versus what’s the first signs of lung cancer in 10 minutes. The diversity of the work and the brevity of the appointments and the level of risk they’re expected to take on is ridiculous.” Rheumatology has totally different challenges, in particular, getting patients to describe the exact kind of pain they are in. In the book, his own descriptions of pain – from kidney stones to rheumatoid arthritis – are often so heartfelt and precise that it sounds more like poetry than work. “The nature of pain is often hugely diagnostically important,” he says, “so you do spend quite a lot of time ruminating on the specific nature of it. A thunderclap headache is literally like being hit in the head with the back of a hammer… cardiac chest pain is more like pressure or crushing. Sharp, stabbing pain may be more associated with a blood clot in the lungs. And words are obviously modulated by culture, language and background.” ‘The nature of pain is often hugely diagnostically important’ … Hutchinson. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Within medicine, rheumatologists are the people you call in when every other test has come up blank. “It’s quite closely coupled to immunology, a kind of highfalutin, investigative field of weird and wonderful diseases,” he says. But it’s also frustrating. “There are two ways you can do it. So you can say: my job is to make a binary decision. I either think you do have an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, in which case you’re my problem, or you just have chronic pain and some other non-immune-mediated thing, in which case you’re not my problem. Goodbye. I think that’s certainly what the managers probably want you to do, because it gets you through lots of patients.” The other way is to accept that your patient “may not have a disease that fits neatly into your of set of immune-mediated diseases. If you have the time to have a chat with them, maybe run 20 minutes late as a result, and say: ‘I understand you’re in pain, we can’t quite get to the bottom of it and I don’t want to give you a drug that’s gonna make you worse, but I still want to engage with the problem.’” From a patient’s perspective, just to feel as if someone has heard the pain is real is better than feeling written-off because they can’t find the cause. Yet to take that holistic view of a patient is to be constantly confronted by all the things you cannot solve. “You can give people the best kind of medical intervention they could hope for, but you’re still probably not going to be able to do everything else that’s going to be required for them to actually feel fulfilled and happy. You’re not going to fix the lift in their block, so they don’t have to walk up 20 flights of stairs with rheumatoid arthritis. That’s the other frustration.” Medicine has to operate in the conditions of the world around it, often with very little influence on that world. Take a cancer diagnosis – which, on the surface, might seem like a leveller. But if you take “someone who’s a multi-millionaire, and someone who’s living on a council estate – fine, they both have cancer, but the environments in which they’re having cancer are vastly different. The worries that they have for their children, their ability to attend appointments, these little things can change how you engage with your treatment.” Nowadays, Hutchinson spends three days a week in his clinic, and two days researching rheumatology and internal medicine at the Crick Institute in King’s Cross. If he has any nerves about the book coming out, it’s mainly whether or not cardiologists can take a joke. Being involved in the worlds of comedy and publishing “made me see that, actually, there are some really good things about medicine. When I see what other people are having to go through with their jobs, the certainty and the progression of the NHS looks great.” On the cusp of becoming a consultant, presumably braced for a new round of “are you really the consultant?”, he’s determined not to change his bedside or overall manner for the job. “A lot of people, when they become consultants, completely change the way they dress, come in suddenly wearing a brand new suit. I would imagine that’s mainly cardiologists.” Are You Really the Doctor? My Life as a Black Doctor in the NHS by Matthew Hutchinson, is published 4 September (£22, Blink Publishing).

431326bdeeea,‘Frightened to get out of their cars’: Britain’s toxic race debates threaten overseas care workers,,"T hey have travelled thousands of miles to care for the most vulnerable people in society. But care workers recruited overseas to fill much-needed roles are increasingly facing racist abuse in the UK, industry insiders have warned, as the country’s immigration debate becomes increasingly toxic. Staff working with elderly and disabled service users have been advised to travel to work in racially mixed groups and carry panic alarms. The measures follow a surge in reports of “verbal abuse and spitting” from strangers since the summer, said Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association (NCA), which represents about 5,000 providers. It comes against a backdrop of charities also warning of growing intimidation , racial abuse and threats of violence towards staff and beneficiaries. Ahmed said: “Providers have been telling us they are very concerned. Racial comments when staff are out at work, staff frightened to get out of their cars until people pass by – people of colour are beginning to feel unwelcome.” She added: “[Workers] have gone to a house to care for somebody, look out of the window and there’s people standing by their car to intimidate them. “We’re giving advice that if you don’t feel safe, don’t leave the building. But of course there’s somebody else who’s waiting for that call. Providers have been saying that where they would send one person to a property, they’re now sending two, but you’re also trying not to send two black or Asian people together. “We’ve got this very negative narrative from politicians , which doesn’t distinguish between illegal migration, asylum seekers, and legal migration, and is almost encouraging people to intimidate. We’re really keen to make sure that nobody’s hurt. Some providers are providing [personal] alarms.” NCA recently met 28 providers concerned about a rise in incidents “over the last couple of months”. Ahmed said: “We had it a lot through Brexit and it feels like that atmosphere again – up about 80% compared to two years ago.” The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) runs an advice line for members of the trade union Unison. Sairah Javed, a JCWI solicitor, said it had been receiving “three or four” calls a week from migrant workers anxious about a “very toxic environment” in the UK since the summer, when previously all calls had been about employer issues. Javed said hardening policies and attitudes occurred at a time when “shortages exist and migrant workers have a choice of where to go”, adding: “We will find ourselves at a detriment. Hospitality and construction are going to be massively hit, as well as social care.” The government closed the post-Brexit sponsored care worker visa route in July. Ahmed said: “We’ve still got 130,000 vacancies. A provider told me last week they had 80 applications for a job they were advertising and not one person turned up for the interview – that’s where it is with trying to get a domestic workforce.” Describing how one English provider recently lost seven overseas staff to Ireland, she added: “The workforce crisis is going to intensify because successive governments have chosen not to have a strategy. But we just keep ignoring that bit and attacking the very workforce that’s willing to come.” Maggie Kimani, 46, returned to Kenya in July after two years as a UK care worker supporting disabled adults. She experienced exploitation from employers – “7am to 8.45pm shifts with no breaks, and if you’re sick, they take it from your holiday” – and racist abuse from a service user’s relative. Kimani added: “She would call you all sorts of names and make my life miserable. I held my tears until I couldn’t hold them any longer. The government opened the doors but you are being treated like you’re worthless. If somebody had told me I would not have left my country in a thousand years.” Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, the chief executive of the charity Work Rights Centre, said: “These incidents don’t happen in isolation. Hate crime increases when our leaders run with a politics of division.” A government spokesperson said: “Racism and abuse are completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. “To ensure a career in adult social care is respected and rewarded, we have provided a funding boost of up to £3.7bn to support social care authorities, announced a major £500m investment in a fair pay agreement for adult care workers across England, and are boosting domestic care careers through a new career structure, funding training and qualifications.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/14/britain-toxic-race-debate-threaten-overseas-care-workers,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c7fb53903b5fed50457c095818468251ee0fea0/979_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d133cca6452a40aa47b67ef5cb946b65",2025-10-14T05:00:11+00:00,f2c6dae54e78afa2608fa9e42a12c784165705cf
97b14841c823,Badenoch accuses Labour of prioritising economic ties with China over national security – as it happened,,"No 10 says claims it concealed evidence or withdrew evidence or witnesses to stop China spy trial 'all categorically untrue' At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson took questions for about 45 minutes on the collapse of the China spying prosecution. The briefing did not provide answers to all the questions raised by Kemi Badenoch (see 10.20am ) and others, but it did move things on a bit. Here are the main points. The government has provided the evidence that was drawn up under the previous government – evidence that was drawn up consistent with the previous government’s stance on China, and consistent with what the Official Secrets Act 1911 requires. The evidence was drawn up using the full range of evidence across government. But he said the government could only provide evidence relating to what the threat assessment of China was at the time the alleged offences were committed. The director of public prosecutions has given his assurance that the the CPS were not influenced any external party. As we repeatedly said also in the course of the last week or so, the suggestions that the government concealed evidence, withdrew evidence, withdrew witnesses are all categorically untrue. The spokesperson rejected suggestions that Jonathan Powell , the national security adviser, sabotaged the prosecution. Referring to a Sunday Times story, the spokesperson said: There have been various reports alleging that a meeting was held about the case in September where the national security adviser ruled that China could not be defined as a threat or took a decision to withdraw evidence or withdraw key witnesses. That is simply untrue. The national security adviser happening, nor any government minister, made no decisions on the content of any evidence relating to the case, nor has he or any government minister had any part in any decisions about the substance of the case itself. At that point, when the Powell meeting was taking place, government officials were working on the basis that the trial was going to go ahead, it is claimed. The spokesperson echoed Hamish Falconer this morning in suggesting that the Official Secrets Act 1911 should have been updated earlier. (See 9.53am .) The spokesperson said the National Security Act which is now in force would make prosecuting alleged offences like these ones (committed when the old law still applied) easier. The new law “removes the unhelpful enemy designation language from the Official Secrets Act” and is “state agnostic”, he said. The spokesperson accepted that in some respects China does pose a “threat” to the UK. This government, like the last one, has been reluctant to explicitly describe China as a threat. The spokesperson said that the national security strategy made it clear that China is a country with “potentially huge consequencese for the lives of British citizens”. He went on: We detailed how instances of China’s espionage, interference in our democracy, undermining our economic security, have increased. In recent years, successive governments said that China can’t be reduced to a single word – either threat, challenge or opportunity – but in reality it presents all of these things, which is why we are taking a long-term, strategic approach. In previous briefings Downing Street has avoided using the word “threat” in the context of China, and so this does seem to be a modest hardening of the government’s position. Share Updated at 08.53 EDT Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Dan Jarvis, the security minister, has described Tory claims that Labour deliberately sabotaged the China spy prosecution as “baseless smears” and said that the trial collapsed in part because the last Tory government did not update the Official Secrets Act earlier. (See 5.50pm and 6.17pm .) For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the blog. Share Updated at 13.22 EDT Jarvis says Badenoch's claims about Labour collapsing spy trial are just 'baseless smears' In his response to Badenoch, Jarvis said that he deliberately gave her a copy of his statement so that she could have time to consider his points. But she did not engage at all with his point about the Official Secrets Act being out of date, he said. He said he hoped they would be having a reasonable debate, but Badenoch was just spreading “baseless smears”. If she thought the government “deliberately collapsed an independent legal process through political interference”, she needed to provide evidence, he said. He also said that Badenoch herself said last year , talking abour her time as a minister, “I have shied away from calling China a threat”. And when she was a minister, Badenoch herself said China was not a foe , he said. Badenoch says she thinks Labour chose to put closer economic ties with China ahead of national security Kemi Badenoch responded to Jarvis on behalf of the Conservatives. She rejected the government’s claim that it could not give the CPS evidence that China was a threat because the last government did not take that view. She quoted from the integrated security and defence review published in 2021, and the update in 2023, and refers to passages in both where China was described as a threat. She went on: Even if the last government had not said China was a threat, and it did, the government only needed to convince a jury that it was a threat. She said she was astonished that Jarvis was repeating the “nonsense” being expressed by the government on this topic. She claimed the government’s case had been dismissed by a former DPP, two former cabinet secretaries, and two former heads of MI6. And she said that only today a professor of public law at Cambridge University said the government’s arguments were misleading. She went on: Is it seriously the government’s argument that no minister knew anything about this until the trial collapsed? If this is the case, it is astonishing. But my suspicion is that it is not the case. My suspicion is that ministers did know … I suspect that they have decided that the closer economic ties with China were more important than due process and or national security, and if this is the case, if that was the decision of this government, then they should just tell us that. Jarvis ended his statement by saying the National Protective Security Authority has today launched new guidance to protect the UK’s democratic institutions. (See 5.21pm .) The guidance will help all members in this and the other place [the House of Lords]. Members of the devolved legislatures, local council members and elected representatives staff to better understand the nature of the threat. It also provides simple, effective steps for individuals at risk to protect themselves, their teams and the integrity of our democratic processes. This guidance will kickstart a wider cross-government action plan … to reduce foreign interference and espionage threats to UK democratic institutions. This will be delivered in close coordination with the parliamentary security authorities. Jarvis says James Cleverly said China should be not called enemy when he was foreign secretary Jarvis restates the govenment’s insistence that it did not hold back anything from the Crown Prosecution Service when the case against the two alleged spies was being prepared. But it was hampered by the fact that it was not the policy of the last government to treat China as an enemy, he says. He says James Cleverly confirmed this when he was foreign secretary. Cleverly said calling China an enemy was “impossible, impractical and most importantly, unwise ”. Jarvis accuses Tories of being too slow to update Official Secrets Act when they were in office Jarvis says some of the reporting about the China spying case has been inaccurate. He says the two accused were prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, the legislation in place at the time the original offences were allegedly committed. But that was “an antiquated law” that was “clearly no longer fit for purpose in addressing the complex and sophisticated nature of the state threats that we face today”. Jarvis goes on It has been clear for many years that this legislation has not kept pace with the modern state threats that we face today. It was evident that the Official Secrets Act was no longer fit for purpose as early as 2015, when Conservative ministers [asked the Law Commission to review it]. In 2020, the Law Commission and the intelligence and security committee of this house were both clear that this legislation, drafted before the first world war, needed to be updated as a matter of urgency. Security minister Dan Jarvis makes statement to MPs about collapse of China spy case Dan Jarvis , the security minister, is delivering his statement now. Referring to his Commons statement in September , he says the goverment remains disappointed that this case did not go to trial. But that was a decision by the CPS, he says. He says he can announce today that MI5’s National Protective Security Authority is taking further steps to protect parliament. The Commons statement on the China spying prosecution that collapsed is about to start. Lindsay Hoyle , the Speaker, says he is very angry about this case. He says he does not think MPs have had the protecting they need. He says he is “angry” and “disappointed”. Here is some response from Scotland’s opposition parties to John Swinney’s conference speech. Russell Findlay , the Scottish Conservative leader, said: John Swinney must believe that scunnered Scots button up the back if he expects them to trust his latest half-baked plan on fixing Scotland’s GP and the wider NHS crisis. As he delivered his recycled rhetoric, he appears to have forgotten that he’s been at the heart of this useless SNP government which has left a trail of broken promises for almost two decades. His latest rallying cry to break up the country will excite diehard nationalists but everyone else is urging him to ‘move on, John’. Jackie Baillie , the deputy Scottish Labour leader, said: John Swinney laid out his three key priorities - independence, independence and independence - in a speech filled with grievance, grudge and disinformation. From reheated NHS pledges that he has already failed to deliver, to desperate attempts to smear his opponents, John Swinney’s speech was half an hour that the audience will never get back. John Swinney was yesterday’s man in 2003 and nothing he has done over the last two decades will convince Scots otherwise. If Swinney had done his job over the last two decades, then we wouldn’t need any of his desperate wheezes. From the Scottish Liberal Democrats Council reorganisation plans for England ignore wishes of residents, MPs told Reorganisations of councils in England could lead to the “death of democracy”, an MP has said, as a chorus of Conservatives urged the government to reconsider its plans. In its report on exchanges in the Commons during housing, communities and local government questions earlier, PA Media says: Alicia Kearns , MP for Rutland and Stamford, was among those who said proposals that threaten to tear up local council boundaries and powers in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Rutland could ride roughshod over residents’ sentiment. Meanwhile former culture secretary John Whittingdale stressed the need for residents to be locally represented, amid changes affecting his Essex constituency. Ministers have announced that council boundaries will be redrawn, with two-tier councils replaced with one larger unitary body that will look after all services from rubbish collection to education. All eventual unitary bodies will need to have populations of about 500,000, forcing mergers of smaller councils, including Rutland, which only has 40,000 residents. Under the three proposals submitted to the government, England’s smallest council could be taken into new bodies, with either Leicestershire or parts of Lincolnshire. The government told MPs its consultation would be published in November. Kearns said: “Residents of Rutland overwhelmingly want to join with Stamford, yet the council’s pushing ahead with an unwanted Leicestershire merger. In South Kesteven, my constituents don’t want to join a mega-Lincolnshire council. Yet they’re being pushed towards this. In Leicestershire my constituents do not want a Leicester city takeover. What reassurance will the government give that democracy will not die under these reforms and local people’s voices will be heard?” Rutland had its county status abolished in 1974, becoming a district of Leicestershire. However it was restored as its own county in 1997 before the Conservatives lost the general election. It led to the creation of a unitary authority. Communities minister Alison McGovern said: “I can certainly confirm that democracy will not die. I know that officials in the department will have heard what she has said, and I will accept her question as representations on the issue of local government.” Security agency tells MPs that Russia, China and Iran may be trying to spy on them MPs are being warned that Russia, China and Iran could be trying to spy on them. As Sky News reports , MI5’s National Protective Security Authority has set that out in new guidance issued today. (See 3.34pm .) The NPSA says: Foreign states also try to interfere with decisions and issues in the UK in a way that is deceptive, corruptive and/or coercive.

4023739ad531,Swinney says Scottish government will sponsor visas for foreign care workers,,"John Swinney has said the Scottish government will help hundreds of overseas care workers stay in the UK, as he attacked Westminster for its rising hostility to immigrants . The first minister said it was unfair Scotland’s older people had to “pay the price for Westminster’s prejudice”, and that his devolved government would sponsor visa applications for workers needed to staff care homes, at a cost of about £500,000. Swinney described the UK government’s decision to greatly restrict access to visas for those jobs, in an effort to respond to rising tensions over mass migration, as deeply damaging. “Thousands of care workers here in the UK entirely legally have been left high and dry, unable to work, while care homes are crying out for staff,” he told the Scottish National party’s annual conference in Aberdeen. “In what world does that make any sense?” Swinney told delegates the measure was further evidence Scotland’s interests were being damaged by continued membership of the UK, as he confirmed he would make a fresh push for independence central to Scottish parliament elections next year. Sketching out some of the key themes for that election campaign, he said Scotland could thrive with “a golden combination” of independence, rejoining the EU and the economic advantages from Scotland’s “vast, low-cost, renewable energy”. In an effort to energise delegates, he said: “We are going to break the logjam in Scottish politics … It’s time to be more assertive.” He cited the fact Scottish council tax and water bills were the UK’s lowest, as were Scotland’s child poverty rates. He highlighted free university tuition and prescriptions, free bus travel for under-22s and the scrapping of peak rail fares. This was delivered by “a government wholly owned by – and wholly serving – the people of Scotland”. Swinney claimed the SNP was within reach of an overall majority at Holyrood by winning 65 seats, a figure he argued would form a mandate for the Scottish government to demand a new independence referendum . That approach has been repeatedly rejected by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, who has said the UK Labour government will not grant Scotland the legal powers to stage one. The first vote, in 2014, was won decisively by anti-independence campaigners, by 55% to 45%. Douglas Alexander, the Scottish secretary, said on Sunday he and other Labour MPs, who won a majority of Scotland’s seats at Westminster last year, had been elected on a manifesto pledge not to approve a second independence vote. Nicola Sturgeon, who quit as first minister in 2023 after failing several times to deliver a new referendum, told reporters on Sunday she knew from experience it would be an “exceptionally hard task” for the SNP to win that majority. Holyrood’s proportional voting system makes it very hard to win an overall majority for one party but Swinney’s goal has resonance for the SNP for several reasons. It has only happened once since the devolved parliament was set up in 1999, when Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader, won the 2011 Holyrood election with 69 of Holyrood’s 129 seats. That triggered talks between his government and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in London on Scotland being given the temporary legal power to hold an independence referendum. But that was a voluntary, political decision by the UK government; there is no legal or constitutional requirement to do so. Swinney hinted on Sunday he believed that could form the basis for a legal challenge if the SNP were to win a majority and Starmer continued to block him. Despite Sturgeon’s warnings, SNP strategists argue privately the independence strategy is necessary to win over hundreds of thousands of pro-independence voters who no longer back the SNP. Many of them voted Labour in last year’s general election.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/john-swinney-scottish-government-sponsor-visas-foreign-care-workers,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e91c0e607a149c71cf76d4e1c99c364b1d3192/1116_378_4174_3339/master/4174.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94b05059bb5d915c13bfc3c071841d7f",2025-10-13T16:28:46+00:00,de7f551f14d72d949f7ecca8d76511999fd27697
74ed67ece2ab,Tomorrow I Leave review – poignant portrait of a care worker sacrificing her home life for her work,,"E very four weeks, Maria leaves her small Romanian town and heads to Austria , where she is employed as a care worker for elderly people. Her life is split between borders and constant goodbyes, a transient emotional state vividly captured in Maria Lisa Pichler and Lukas Schöffel’s intimate portrait. In the opening scene, Maria drives along her local roads, pointing out the houses left empty by those who have moved abroad for work opportunities. Under the precarious forces of economy, it seems as if a whole community is gradually evaporating. Structured around Maria’s monthly drives, the film juxtaposes her home life with her professional duties. Simple scenes of family gatherings bristle with tension. Maria’s son Ionuț laments her absence, which he deems to be a sign of emotional neglect. But as the primary breadwinner Maria takes on the gruelling job to provide a better future for her children. In another poignant parallel, we see her ageing parents whose ramshackle farmhouse contrasts sharply with the middle-class apartments of her Austrian clients. There’s a bitter irony in how Maria makes a living by caring for other people’s relatives, while unable to fully tend to her own. Misunderstood by her loved ones at home and ostracised by anti-migrant rhetoric in Austria, Maria finds herself locked in an impossible paradox with no easy answer. The only people who can fully understand her predicament are fellow Romanian workers who, like her, live between worlds. The current reality of global wealth inequality further intensifies the cycle of separation. In a crucial scene between Maria’s teenage children and their friends, many have already spoken of migrating despite their deep love for their home country. While there are no easy solutions to the struggles of migrant workers, the film lends a beautifully human touch to a topic so often reduced to mere statistics.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/13/tomorrow-i-leave-review-poignant-portrait-of-a-care-worker-sacrificing-her-home-life-for-her-work,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88eb531d1cd3635d7c194d4249f4461a6aa0225/657_118_2398_1918/master/2398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b714401226a737a38142de36cf588a06",2025-10-13T06:00:15+00:00,35db776f49415274f094541c82898e3b72fc34a3
c590ae8b44fd,Post-ministerial jobs watchdog closes as part of UK government ethics shake-up,,"The much-criticised watchdog that scrutinises the jobs UK ministers can take after leaving office will be formally scrapped on Monday as part of a wider shake-up of the ethics structure in government. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), described by critics as fundamentally toothless, has been closed, a Cabinet Office announcement said, with its functions taken over by two existing regulators. At the same time, a new organisation called the Ethics and Integrity Commission will oversee the work of a series of other regulators, the centrepiece of what Keir Starmer has promised will be a robust new approach to government and to any ministerial misdeeds. Also from Monday, a previously announced ban on severance payments for ministers who lose their job after a serious breach of the ministerial code comes into force. In the change, first revealed by the Guardian in July, former ministers who take up new jobs in a serious breach of the rules for post-government appointments could be asked to hand back any severance payment. The standard severance payment for a departing minister is a quarter of their ministerial salary, as long as they are not given a new frontbench post within three weeks. For cabinet ministers this equates to just under £17,000. Under the new system, those who serve for fewer than six months will be expected to not take the payment, while those who get a new ministerial job within three months will be asked to not take a salary until the end of that three-month period. With Acoba abolished, Sir Laurie Magnus, Starmer’s independent adviser on ministerial standards, will adjudicate on job appointment rules for ex-ministers. The Civil Service Commission, which regulates recruitment into the civil service, will do this for former civil servants and government special advisers. The Ethics and Integrity Commission is, however, not an entirely new organisation, but takes on the work of the existing Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), which was tasked with giving the prime minister advice on broader ethical standards. The commission will be headed by the CSPL’s existing chair, Doug Chalmers, a former soldier who ended his military career as deputy chief of defence staff. In a letter to Chalmers marking the new commission, Starmer said one of the organisation’s tasks should be to make sure ministers and civil servants help other public servants meet their responsibilities under the still-to-be-passed Hillsborough law , which obliges them to act with honesty and candour and avoid cover-ups. The announcement said: “The prime minister has made clear public service is a privilege and is committed to showing how politics can be a force for good. The government’s manifesto pledge to set the highest standards in public life to restore trust between the public and politics.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister of state for the Cabinet Office, said the Ethics and Integrity Commission “will play a central role” in ensuring the government delivers its pre-election promise to uphold the highest standards in public office. It remains to be seen how big an impact will come from a minor reorganisation of the framework for monitoring ethical standards, and the creation of a new, top-level watchdog, the job of which is not to enforce rules but to help make sure others to do so. As well as Magnus’s office and the Civil Service Commission, other ethics-related bodies for public life include the parliamentary standard commissioner, parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Service, the House of Lords Appointments Commission, the Electoral Commission, the UK Parliamentary Standards Authority and the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists.

f51ea55e639f,Looking for signs of life in centre-right politics in Britain,,"Dating as I do from the second world war, I can assure Zoe Williams that the Tory party started imploding well before Boris Johnson, David Cameron and co ( Enjoying the implosion of the Tories? That’s understandable – but completely wrong, 6 October ). One-nation Tories became extinct the minute Margaret Thatcher took office. The true old-school Conservatives were the Macmillan generation, and they were possibly a one-off. That generation had seen two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in the first), they’d witnessed the great slump of the 1920s and 30s, and consequently they’d had their eyes opened and had to question their often privileged upbringings. They largely continued the Keynesian social democratic policies established by Labour’s Clement Attlee (also public school educated and wounded in the first world war) and this continued until Thatcher established the wrecking ball of Friedmanism, which has now had 45 years to demonstrate its legacy of record inequality, tottering public services and our companies departing abroad in ever increasing numbers. But don’t hold your breath for a change in the party. The English electorate, at least, have always shown a healthy appetite for masochism and being told their place. There may be life in Thatcherism yet. David Redshaw Saltdean, East Sussex Kemi Badenoch says that she will scrap stamp duty on primary residences if elected ( Report, 8 October ). The “party of fiscal responsibility” proposes to create a tax deficit while the country’s debt is running at 100% of GDP and we pay almost as much in debt interest as we do on education. How is this responsible? Does she understand nothing about the factors driving house prices? People’s ability to buy is limited by their ability to borrow, and part of the borrowing needs to cover the cost of paying stamp duty. Cut out the stamp duty and all that will happen is house prices will rise to close the gap. The economic illiteracy of the Tories continues to astound me. Des Senior Aylesbeare, Devon The Conservative leadership now regrets that the size of our civil service has increased in the last nine years. Did it not occur to any of them that leaving the EU would involve adding extra staff in London to handle regulatory issues that had been managed collectively with our partners in the EU, as well as to negotiate the multiple bilateral relationships with our European neighbours that are essential now that we are outside? William Wallace Liberal Democrat, House of Lords While agreeing with Polly Toynbee that a grownup centre‑right party is a necessary evil, I hope she’s not expecting us to look out the nose peg she has previously championed to go out and vote for them ( I didn’t think I’d ever say this: let’s hope the Tory party can be saved, 7 October ). Les Bright Exeter “Britain badly needs a grownup party of the centre right,” says the subheading on Polly Toynbee’s article. Isn’t that what Labour is trying to be?

f39106ea967d,Revealed: Labour-run council using legal loophole to serve families with no-fault evictions,,"A Labour-run council is using a legal loophole to issue dozens of families with no-fault evictions, despite Keir Starmer’s manifesto pledge to outlaw the practice. Scrapping no-fault evictions “immediately” was one of Labour’s main manifesto pledges before its 2024 election win, but more than a year on, the party’s flagship renters’ rights bill has not been made law. Local authorities cannot normally carry out no-fault evictions – known officially as section 21 evictions – as they apply to tenancies issued by private landlords. However, Lambeth council in south London has been able to start eviction proceedings against 63 households because it created an arm’s-length body to manage some of its housing stock. Five families have already been issued with possession orders via the courts and two of those have had their homes repossessed by bailiffs. Another 24 have left properties voluntarily after receiving a section 21 notice. Internal council documents seen by the Guardian suggest that council officials have been planning to regain possession of the properties since at least 2023, but the full implementation of the scheme was delayed until after last year’s election. An internal briefing document from March 2024 read: “Advice received from democratic and legal services [is] that this is a key decision and it is too controversial to take during the pre-election period.” Plans to evict the tenants were made despite the fact Lambeth council wrote to the Conservative government in 2019, asking it to end no-fault evictions. The tenancies were overseen by Homes for Lambeth, a group of companies wholly owned by the council. It was established in 2017 as part of an estate regeneration scheme. As part of this initiative, the local authority bought back some properties from residents who had purchased former council houses at a discount as part of the right-to-buy scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1980. The council then transferred these properties to Homes for Lambeth. This meant they were able to be rented on the private market, despite ultimately being owned by the local authority. At its peak, Homes for Lambeth managed about 200 properties across six estates. However, Homes for Lambeth is now being disbanded due to concerns over poor performance after an independent review by former senior civil servant Bob Kerslake in 2022. Kerslake recommended that management of the Homes for Lambeth stock be brought back “in house” to improve efficiency. About 100 of the homes were vacated voluntarily before eviction notices were issued. The council is now using legal measures in an attempt to regain possession of the remaining properties. In internal documents, it said this would help it meet the “most urgent” housing needs in the borough, including accommodating vulnerable families who needed temporary housing after being made homeless. Some residents tried to challenge the decision in court, but in June a judge ruled that current laws do not prevent councils from setting up companies to issue private tenancies. Jules Zakolska, 27, who received a section 21 notice in April, has been at the forefront of efforts to fight the decision on behalf of the affected residents. She said some have been driven to the brink of suicide by the stress. Zakolska said she and her partner, July Kaliszewska, 24, had also suffered severe mental health issues as they faced the prospect of their home being repossessed by bailiffs. Zakolska, a university social sciences student, has lived in the property in Clapham with Kaliszewska, a bar manager, for three years. She is autistic and suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain and fatigue. She says she is “traumatised” by the prospect of ending up in temporary accommodation. She said: “Lambeth just doesn’t care. It says it wants to provide housing for the most vulnerable people, but if it makes us homeless, we will become those people. They have created this issue and traumatised us. It’s not right. I’m struggling. Who wouldn’t be, with the prospect of becoming homeless? It’s taken over my life.” A Lambeth council spokesperson said: “With almost 5,000 vulnerable homeless Lambeth families staying in often poor-quality temporary accommodation every night, there are incredibly difficult choices to be made. To do nothing would ignore their plight. “When the opportunity arose we chose, legally, to use properties we own to house the homeless rather than rent them out privately on a short-term basis. “The majority of these homes have been returned to the council. We have supported tenants who needed help through this process, while successfully giving dozens of homeless families a roof over their heads. “This situation is just one example of what long-term structural underfunding of council services, the national failure to build the homes we need, and the ongoing housing crisis looks like on the frontline. “The high cost of housing in Lambeth and across inner city London is a huge driver of deprivation – a point we are working hard to communicate to government.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We need to do everything we can to support people out of homelessness and we are open to new approaches on this. “We are spending £1bn on homelessness and building 1.5m homes, so we can tackle the housing crisis we inherited and help councils like Lambeth manage housing need in their areas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/11/lambeth-council-legal-loophole-no-fault-evictions,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3359343504e7dc51ab70643e89370e0b4de0cf62/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8966e1b9662cd3746ac12cf280296ee",2025-10-11T11:17:33+00:00,768cf413f805716b220f4b3d236c5ea1d88e9d3d
0a1fd29a49b5,The false economy of reduced public services,,"George Monbiot is correct that cuts in public services cost far more than the money saved ( It hurt when I crashed my bike into a pothole – and it taught me the true price of austerity, 4 October ). I am a trustee of a small charity in Kent, The Social Justice Network , which runs a number of projects, including supporting refugees and their families to settle locally. Recently we welcomed a family of 10 (parents and eight children aged five to 16) from another county. The council had worked hard to house the family in its area but was unable to, despite having accepted its duty to do so. As a result of a forced move of nearly 100 miles at 24 hours’ notice, the father lost his job and is now benefit capped. Removing the two-child limit would make this family only marginally better off as they would still face the family benefit cap. Organisations including the Department for Work and Pensions, Canterbury city council and Kent county council (KCC) worked with us to find schools, healthcare, benefits, food banks and free English classes for the parents, which were essential if they were to find work, settle and contribute to society. However, they were turned down for bus passes by KCC (which said there were no funds for this). The parents had no means of transport to get to the local adult education centre (funded by KCC) nearly three miles from their home. As a result of not attending, they were kicked off the course. The family has since been rehoused, but for three months they were not learning English, not employed, not settled. They are one family among thousands, trapped in poverty and isolation by disjointed policies that are ostensibly about money, but which fail to acknowledge the true cost. Jeremy Cross Canterbury George Monbiot’s excellent article on the actual cost of potholes does not mention one infuriating aspect of the whole sorry business. Road maintenance has been outsourced for decades by council authorities to private contractors on the basis, one assumes, that it looks cheaper on the council’s books. But private contractors appear to have little interest in doing a good, lasting repair. What they want to do is a cosmetic “throw-and-go”, which deteriorates rapidly. This is the basis of their projected income stream – repeat purchase – as it is for any business. It’s no use blaming the contractors, as they are only doing what any business would do when faced with a tender system that always favours the lowest quote. The council, in turn, is similarly trapped in a system where it wants to keep council tax as low as possible and economise wherever possible on the cost of services. There is little interest in undertaking longer-term cost analysis because it might reveal myopic decision-making. Monica Hall Farnborough, Hampshire Politicians pride themselves on their realism, yet they invariably choose the more expensive option over the cheaper one. In this example, doing nothing over doing something, for fear of financial overspend. The same meanness applies to the two-child benefit cap. The spirit of the Dickensian workhouse is alive and kicking in contemporary Britain. The reason is the embedding of neoliberalism in mainstream political thinking. As for Margaret Thatcher , so for Keir Starmer: there is no alternative. A ramshackle Britain is the price worth paying, as low taxes mean the freeing of entrepreneurial talents of the wealthy. That plus the belief in transferring state enterprise to the more capable hands of private management. As a citizen of this country, I have yet to see any of the benefits of neoliberalism materialise. Derrick Joad Leeds George Monbiot’s analysis of the negative financial, as well as physical, effects of potholes highlights the repeated failure of governments to appreciate the economic‑growth benefits of maintaining and improving the country’s transport links.

3e6eb8d19fbb,Charity staff shouldn’t face this abhorrent abuse,,"Charities’ struggles to protect their staff and deliver their work in the face of unwarranted attacks and hatred are profoundly worrying ( UK charities say toxic immigration rhetoric leading to threats against staff, 13 October ). Charities have championed the welfare of those who are vulnerable and ostracised, for centuries. That endeavour is vital not just to our civil society, but to our self-respect as a civilised nation. The Charity Commission will defend and protect the right – and indeed the responsibility – of charities to deliver on their lawful purposes. Over recent weeks, I have met with a wide range of charities, including a group of charities working with refugees and migrants, to hear about the challenges they are facing. I was disturbed by the measures some need to take simply to protect staff and their families from harm, including death threats, and to prevent and respond to criminal damage to property. Charities are not above the law, and their work should be open to scrutiny and rational debate. But nobody should face this kind of abhorrent abuse while doing their job. The commission takes seriously each and every concern that is raised with us – that is our duty and our promise to the public. But we will make short shrift of complaints that seek to weaponise charities to further political ends that have nothing to do with the charity law framework.

544c9b5e5093,Kate Bush and artists harness power of Running Up That Hill for War Child appeal,,"Kate Bush is harnessing the power of her global hit Running Up That Hill in collaboration with leading names in British art to raise money for children caught up in global conflicts. The singer-songwriter invited 52 visual artists to respond to her lyric “If I only could, I’d make a deal with God” from her 1985 anthem. One of her best-loved songs and hailed as “one of the greatest songs of all time” by Rolling Stone, it became a hit all over again in 2022 when it featured in the fourth season of the US TV series Stranger Things. Maggi Hambling, once described as the “original bad girl of art” and Peter Doig, whose paintings have sold for millions , are among those to contribute works interpreting the lyric for the fundraiser Sound & Vision, named after David Bowie’s 1977 hit. All the works will feature in an online auction , from 28 October to 13 November, with starting bids at £100, to raise money for the charity War Child , which protects, educates, and stands up for the rights of children living in war zones. Midnight Wave by Maggi Hambling. Photograph: Maggi Hambling Announcing the project, Bush said: “All wars leave horrific scars; ruined lives, families ripped apart, life-changing injuries, trauma, and loss on a massive scale – but it’s the children who suffer the most in so many ways. Their past, present and future melt away into fear and uncertainty. “It is more important than ever we support War Child and their invaluable work providing immediate aid to children caught in conflict all over the world including in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and Syria. Projects like Sound & Vision harness the power of art and music to make a real difference to children living through war.” Kate Bush photographed in London, 1978. Photograph: Gered Mankowitz/Iconic Images Doig has contributed two signed pieces: The Hill, on the theme of the crucifixion, and Child of War depicting a child looking at a figure on horseback. Hambling’s contribution is titled Midnight Wave. Charlie Calder-Potts, Britain’s youngest female official war artist who worked with the British army in Afghanistan, and who has since travelled the world creating work in Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and at Yazidi refugee camps in Iraq, has created a new work. So too have Corbin Shaw, known for textiles, prints and flags capturing modern-day Britishness through ancient crafts; Susie Hamilton, a former artist-in-residence at St Paul’s Cathedral whose portraits of doctors, nurses and patients facing Covid-19 are held by the Science Museum; and Unskilled Worker, AKA Helen Downie, who discovered painting aged 48 and shot to industry-wide fame, growing an Instagram following of more than 280,000 followers. The exhibition, curated by Art on a Postcard and sponsored by DHL, will go on display at Iconic Images Gallery in Piccadilly, London, from 4-8 November. Contributors also include LUAP, Hannah Lim, Kate McCrickard, Erin Lawlor, Gill Button, Adam Dix, David Harrison, Gideon Rubin, Boo Saville, Shezad Dawood, Natalia González Martín, while Peter Messer and Nick Grindrod will return after taking part in last year’s Sound & Vision. And If I Only Could I’d Make a Deal With God by Susie Hamilton. Photograph: Susie Hamilton Bush follows in the footsteps of Bowie as a supporter of War Child. Bowie helped curate a fundraising exhibition for the charity in 1994 called Little Pieces from Big Stars , which 30 years later was the inspiration for the first Sound & Vision last year with artists responding to the lyric “We like dancing and we look divine” from his song Rebel Rebel. The curator Gemma Peppé, the founder of Art on a Postcard, said Bush’s lyric had “prompted some great contemporary artists to produce some vibrant and evocative work”. She said Doig had asked if he could take part. “I nearly fell off my chair. That’s a testament to the great work War Child does.” Charlotte Nimmo from War Child UK, which is present in a number of active conflict zones including Ukraine and Gaza, said: “We are delighted to announce that Sound & Vision is returning, this year inspired by lyrics from the incredible Kate Bush. This is made possible thanks to the immense generosity of both Kate and her team, as well as the iconic artists that are creating and donating pieces inspired by Kate’s lyrics.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/13/kate-bush-artists-running-up-that-hill-war-child-appeal,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24765663c30e5e21b87984be96f7d7e5f1c36b9a/111_478_2282_1826/master/2282.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=660e2c9f6b00eabc186c7ae149d22a29",2025-10-13T09:42:10+00:00,c69052bba86b894ca56adb98000fb09a16e49b46
387889626fbc,UK charities say toxic immigration rhetoric leading to threats against staff,,"Charities have warned of growing racial abuse, intimidation and threats of violence towards their staff and beneficiaries amid increasingly toxic rhetoric around immigration and race by politicians and extremist activists. Voluntary organisations say they are being forced to introduce extensive security measures to protect staff and property – a trend described by one charity head as in danger of becoming the “new normal” – after being targeted. Refugee and asylum seeker charities, Muslim, Jewish and ethnic minority organisations, women’s groups, youth bodies, homelessness charities and even charity shops have reported being subject to violence, threats and abuse. Incidents include threats to rape and kill staff, verbal and physical abuse of beneficiaries on the street, attempted break-ins to charity-owned accommodation, and damage to offices and vandalism, including anti-migrant and racist graffiti. Charities were being “targeted because of what they stand for and who they support”, said Saskia Konynenburg, executive director at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The threat has become more explicit and targeted since the far-right Southport riots in 2024 and the spread of inflammatory political and social media rhetoric around immigrants and “small boats”, say charities. They add the abuse has become more extreme and uninhibited in the way it is expressed or enacted, both on and offline. A coalition of more than 150 charities including Age UK, Citizens Advice and the Muslim Council of Britain has written to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, urging him to challenge the “cynical” targeting of civil society organisations by far-right politicians and activists seeking to stoke division for political gain in local communities. Ali Harris, the chief executive of equality and human rights charity Equally Ours , which organised the letter, said: “The devastating antisemitic attack at Heaton Park Synagogue is a tragic reminder that it’s never been more important for us all to stand united when any of our communities are targeted. “We are taking this collective stand because the organisations in this coalition and the communities we serve are experiencing growing threats and aggression – in places of worship, offices, shops, on public transport and high streets. People with extreme views are increasingly violent in how they express or act on their hatred.” One charity chief executive told the Guardian increasingly mainstream political rhetoric on the political right denigrating immigrants and refugees, and stoking community divisions along ethnic lines had created a “permission structure” for racism which had emboldened far-right activists. Last month, a drugs and alcohol charity in east London that formerly shared its premises with a refugee support charity was daubed with a George Cross and far-right graffiti. Volunteers repainted the office front only for far-right activists to return and deface the building with the slogan “East London stands with Southport”, a reference to the far right riots in Southport in 2024. Some charities have taken drastic safeguarding action in response to the threats including installing safe rooms , fitting staff with phone trackers, hiring security guards, taking down charity signs outside offices, removing staff names from websites and redacting trustee names from publicly available Charity Commission filings. Others have temporarily closed offices on the advice of local police, stopped providing outreach services because of the potential danger to staff and beneficiaries, and drawn up emergency action plans in the event their premises are attacked. One refugee charity head said they currently spent “60% of the time managing safety issues related to far-right activism”. Another charity told the Guardian it was considering spending thousands of pounds on personal safety devices. One charity head described the tight focus on staff security as the “new normal”. The chief executive of a London charity working with asylum seekers, who like most of those the Guardian spoke to wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, said the threats had a chilling effect but staff were determined to continue: “We do the work we do because we care and the people we support have been through terrible things and deserve a bit of kindness.” The letter to the prime minister, sent a fortnight ago, called on the government to provide “clear and consistent leadership” to defend the values of inclusion, equality and anti-racism and “take a stand against the division and hate” fuelled by politicians scapegoating communities for political gain. “We are witnessing the significant damage to people of all backgrounds caused by the far-right’s cynical spreading of division and hostility between communities, their undermining of the rule of law, and the weaponisation of violence against women and girls.” It adds: “We are experiencing increasing racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism on the streets and in workplaces, including abuse of charity staff and charity shop volunteers. All this alongside attacks by the media and threats of violence against lawyers and civil society groups working with migrant and other marginalised communities.” A government spokesperson said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. This government has pride in our tolerant and diverse country, and we are dedicated to tackling inequality at its roots, including working closely with ethnic minority leaders to enact change. “We have a strong legal framework in place to deal with the perpetrators of racism and other forms of hate crime and expect those responsible for these abhorrent offences to be brought to justice.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

a89aad431f9a,Nature groups rebuke Reeves for ‘cynical’ 11th-hour planning bill changes,,"Last-minute changes to the government’s planning bill have sparked a furious backlash from nature groups who have mounted an attack on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves , over her plans to remove environmental protections. The changes to the legislation come as it enters its final stages before being signed into law. Promoted by Reeves, they are designed to make it easier for developers to side-step environmental laws in order to build major projects such as AI datacentres. They include new powers for the government to overrule local democracy if councils refuse developments based on environmental grounds, or on issues such as water shortages. But in outspoken attacks on the chancellor, charities including household names such as the RSPB and Wildlife Trusts say Reeves is seeking to grab short-term growth headlines to save her budget, rather than well-thought-out reforms to planning. Reeves is pushing for the planning bill to be passed before her budget on 26 November so that she is able to factor it into forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which could give her about £3bn extra breathing room against her own debt rules. The charities have spent months working with ministers in an attempt to forge the best planning bill to ensure growth and nature recovery go hand in hand. Dr James Robinson, the RSPB’s chief operating officer, said: “Dropping 67 amendments to the planning bill at the 11th hour isn’t just poor process, it’s legislative chaos. There’s no time for proper scrutiny, no clarity on the cumulative impact, and no confidence this is about good planning rather than political optics. “It looks like a cynical attempt to game a better forecast from the OBR, rather than a serious effort to fix the planning system.” The intervention by Reeves into the landmark bill comes after she was filmed boasting about her closeness to a major developer after she intervened to lift legal blocks to their housing plans. The objections to 21,000 homes being built in Sussex concerned water shortages and concerns over the amount of water being taken from rivers and wetlands in the Arun Valley, which risked affecting protected wildlife and local water resources. The MP for Horsham, John Milne, has criticised the chancellor’s intervention, stating that it was top-down government at its worst. “This decision rides roughshod over the work that Horsham district council has been carrying out to find a balanced solution.” One amendment promoted by Reeves would allow more central government intervention in local decision making. It allows the secretary of state to overrule councils that refuse permission for projects, even if they have legitimate concerns on environmental grounds, or there are issues relating to water shortages. The amendment is designed to ease the path of major infrastructure projects, for example AI datacentres, which create vast amounts of CO2 and put huge pressure on water resources. Alexa Culver, an environmental lawyer from RSK Wilding, said: “For the first time, the secretary of state will be able to make orders that prevent refusals of planning permission by planning authorities. “This could direct authorities to ignore real-world infrastructure and environmental constraints – like water shortages – to allow harmful development through that leaves local communities stranded.” Joan Edwards, director of policy and public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said Reeves was trying to grab headlines about growth measures before her budget. “The chancellor continues to fail to understand that a healthy natural environment underpins a healthy economy. These performative amendments represent neither a win for development or the economy, and promise only delay and muddle in planning and marine policy.” Richard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government’s race to speed up planning decisions would fall flat on its face if it did not include the environment at its core. “Last-minute changes to the bill are being made in a hurried and piecemeal approach,” he said. “This kind of scatter-gun policymaking doesn’t give businesses or investors the certainty they need to drive growth, and it puts the UK’s irreplaceable natural environment at risk.” Government officials have said the amendments were required in part because an earlier watering-down of the bill in the summer had damaged investor confidence. However, no data has been provided to back this claim. The government said that, if passed, each of these “pro-growth changes” would accelerate its “plan for change” to build 1.5m homes, achieve clean power by 2030 and raise living standards across the country. Steve Reed, the housing secretary, said: “Britain’s potential has been shackled by governments unwilling to overhaul the stubborn planning system that has erected barriers to building at every turn. It is simply not true that nature has to lose for economic growth to succeed. “Sluggish planning has real-world consequences. Every new house blocked deprives a family of a home. Every infrastructure project that gets delayed blocks someone from a much-needed job. This will now end.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/15/nature-groups-rebuke-reeves-for-cynical-11th-hour-planning-bill-changes,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/436b2196f2e7876ef01e4d4985770e5b3437f6b8/1562_0_3938_3150/master/3938.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b322536854f82089f8806c2a388175ef",2025-10-15T10:33:58+00:00,31bd27622301750a2d2f79615f64fbd0c52234f9
edb941ee13dc,Rachel Reeves to confirm changes to ‘outdated’ planning system,,"Ministers are making it easier to build windfarms, reservoirs and large housing developments as part of a series of changes to the government’s planning and infrastructure bill designed to bolster the confidence of developers. The changes, which were first revealed by the Guardian, will be confirmed on Tuesday by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as part of a pre-budget push to underline the government’s commitment to economic growth. They include reducing the role of Natural England in helping decide on relatively minor applications and freeing up developers to build turbines near seismic sensors in southern Scotland. Officials say the amendments to the bill were required in part because the government damaged investor confidence by watering down the bill earlier in the summer. Reeves is hoping the bill will pass the Lords in time to be factored into the growth forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which could give her about £3bn extra breathing room against her own debt rules. Reeves said in a statement: “The outdated planning system has been gummed up by burdensome bureaucracy and held to ransom by blockers for too long. “Our pro-growth planning bill shows we are serious about cutting red tape to get Britain building again, backing the builders not the blockers to speed up projects and show investors that we are a country that gets spades in the ground and our economy growing.” Steve Reed, the housing secretary, said: “Britain’s potential has been shackled by governments unwilling to overhaul the stubborn planning system that has erected barriers to building at every turn. It is simply not true that nature has to lose for economic growth to succeed.” Reeves and Reed have agreed a number of amendments to the planning bill, which is due back in the Lords on 20 October. One would allow ministers to stop councils refusing planning permission if they are considering “calling in” the application to be decided at a national level. Recent examples of planning applications which have been called in include controversial plans to build a large new Chinese embassy near Tower Bridge. Another would be specifically aimed at allowing developers to build wind turbines near the Eskdalemuir seismic array, which monitors nuclear test activity around the world. The MoD had raised concerns its equipment could be undermined by nearby turbines. A third would aim to limit when Natural England , the environmental regulator, should be involved in planning decisions. Reeves is keen to go further in freeing up the planning system, including with a nature bill later in the parliament, which would mean the UK abandoning EU rules on protected species and drawing up its own instead. But ministers and officials cannot agree on the need for a separate second planning bill. Some in the government want to legislate again to make it easier to build large infrastructure projects such as a third runway at Heathrow, but others think such a bill would be a politically damaging and unnecessary distraction.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/14/rachel-reeves-planning-system-changes,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/192084e4ca8fcc843b0db98d06a71b28a4993e31/587_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d65f9922056164b5082bb55ab7e17de1",2025-10-14T06:42:17+00:00,b84deb2ba1f0d5705048d8e735a46cce29168f87
b3c92d126f54,No 10 publishes key witness statements in China spy row,,"Downing Street has published three witness statements from UK’s deputy national security adviser in an effort to draw as line under the row over why spying charges against two Britons accused of spying for China were dropped last month. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry fell away because prosecutors could not obtain evidence from Matthew Collins that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK” over “many months”. The third and final statement supplied by Collins in August describes China’s intelligence services as “highly capable” and that they “conduct large scale espionage operations agains the UK to advance the Chinese state’s interests and harm the interests and security of the UK”. It was his final effort at ending a stand off with the Stephen Parkinson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, but though similar to the language sought by prosecutors was nevertheless not thought sufficient by them to allow the case to proceed. The decision to release the statements was made by Keir Starmer at the start of prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, which were at the heart of the decision as to why the CPS dropped the case. Earlier, the chairs of five parliamentary committees met with Parkinson to discuss how they will scrutinise the affair in the afternoon. According to one report the director of prosecutions told them the statements were “5% less than the evidence threshold that was needed” – though the CPS declined to comment. The extraordinary disclosures came a month after prosecutors unexpectedly announced on 15 September they were dropping charges against two Britons, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China. The CPS said it could no longer meet the evidential threshold to proceed with the espionage charges against Christopher Cash, who worked for the Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, and Christopher Berry, a teacher. Cash and Berry, who had always maintained their innocence, now have no case to answer. The decision triggered an extraordinary blame game between ministers and prosecutors. Parkinson told MPs last week that the case had to be dropped because despite “many months” of efforts, the government did not provide witness statements stating that China “represented a threat to national security” at the time of the offence. But ministers have insisted that they had no role in shaping the evidence that was submitted to the CPS, which was drafted entirely by a senior official based on the Conservative government’s approach to China in 2023. Downing Street revealed this week that three witness statements were submitted by Matthew Collins, the government’s deputy national security adviser, to support the case. The first and most substantive statement was submitted in December 2023 under the Conservatives. Keir Starmer said Collins had submitted two supplementary witness statements this year, including one in August just weeks before the case was abandoned. Downing Street said that Starmer himself did not see the witness statements until Wednesday morning, hours before they were made public after prosecutors said they had no objection to their release. Jonathan Powell, the government’s security adviser, has come under pressure following the disclosure that he attended an internal Whitehall meeting to discuss the implications of trial days before it was abandoned. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, is expected to spell out the threats posed by China in an annual security update. Whitehall insiders are frustrated by the failure to prosecute Cash and Berry and reiterate they stand by previous warnings about Chinese hacking and industrial espionage. Earlier on Wednesday, Dominic Cummings, who served as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, had said that China had breached secure high-level systems involving Strap material and this had not been made public – but this was denied by former senior cyber security officials working in Whitehall and the Cabinet Office within hours. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “It is untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised.” Other senior officials said the story was untrue. The developments unfolded as Oliver Robbins, the most senior servant in the Foreign Office, was visiting China for high-level government meetings. Sources briefed on his trip said he was holding discussions about controversial proposals for a Chinese super-embassy in London and the renovations needed on the British embassy in Beijing.

d432caff1193,Rachel Reeves says higher taxes on wealthy ‘part of the story’ for November budget,,"Rachel Reeves has said higher taxes on the UK’s wealthy will form part of next month’s budget, as she shrugged off the “scaremongering” and “bleating” of her critics, and stressed her determination to repair the public finances. Speaking in Washington, where she is attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the chancellor told the Guardian there “won’t be a return to austerity” and hinted at tax increases for the most well-off. Reeves is expected to announce a package of tax rises on 26 November, in response to a downgrade in future growth forecasts from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Asked whether higher taxes on the wealthy would feature, the chancellor said “that will be part of the story”. She added: “Last year, when we announced things like the non-doms , like the [tax increase for] private equity, like the VAT on private school fees, there was so much bleating that it wasn’t going to raise the money – that people would leave. “The OBR will publish updated numbers on all of those things. And that scaremongering didn’t pay off, because this is a brilliant country and people want to live here. “And I think, when people scaremonger again this year, we should take some of that with a pinch of salt.” Reeves has previously ruled out imposing a new “wealth tax” but campaigners for changes to the system have highlighted other options, including: raising the rate of capital gains tax; levying national insurance on rental income and on partners in law firms and consultancies; and creating higher council tax bands. Why it is so hard to tax the super-rich – video There is also speculation she will revive plans to overhaul tax-free Isas to divert cash towards the UK stock market. Reeves declined to comment on specific measures, though she stressed the package would be aimed at boosting economic growth, as well as raising revenue. Last year’s budget included a historic £40bn of tax increases and fuelled a furious backlash from business, which bore the brunt of the rise in national insurance contributions. Asked if spending cuts would form part of the budget package, Reeves pointed to potential cost-savings from the use of new technologies but stressed that departmental budgets had been set in this year’s spending review. She hopes to deliver a decisive budget which will persuade bond markets to lower the UK’s borrowing costs and she repeatedly contrasted her approach, of sticking to Labour’s investment plans in the face of the deteriorating outlook, with the approach of the Conservatives and the Reform party. “In the budget next month, there won’t be a return to austerity. We know that we face a changing global environment in terms of the economy at the moment. “But last year, I put investment in, to reduce waiting lists, to build housing, to build the energy infrastructure to get people’s bills down sustainably, not through quick fixes, and we’ll stick to that course.” Asked how she would explain the need for further tax rises, Reeves said she hoped the public would recognise the global economic outlook had darkened. “I think people can see that this year, in 2025, the world’s been a very, very volatile place,” she said. “You turn on your TV every night, it might not always be about the economy, but every night, one of the top two or three stories on the news is going to be around some sort of global tensions that is having repercussions at home. So I think that the British people recognise all of that.” She added: “I’m being honest and I think the British people respect that and it means I’m not always able to offer the easy answers and the platitudes and the false promises.” However, she criticised the OBR for the politically awkward timing of its productivity review, coming after Reeves carried out a spending review in June. “I think that it would have been a lot better if they had adjusted their forecasts the year before the election, or even last summer, to enable the new government to really understand the economic position.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves said: “Those forecasts are going to change this year, but it does reinforce what I said all the way through the election campaign, that the number one priority of this government is to grow the economy.” She pointed to the Tories’ policy of austerity and the impact of Brexit as the key factors behind the UK’s weak productivity record, which stretches back to the global financial crisis of 2008. Experts expect the independent forecaster to say the public finances look £10bn-£20bn weaker in five years’ time than it believed at the spring statement in March. That downgrade comes in addition to the £7bn cost of Labour’s U-turns on the winter fuel allowance, and botched reforms to disability benefits. As well as closing that gap, Reeves is expected to use the budget to build up greater headroom against her fiscal rules, to cushion the UK against volatility in government bond markets, which has a knock-on effect on the Treasury’s borrowing costs. When the £10bn margin for error she allowed herself in last year’s budget looked set to be wiped out at the time of the spring statement, she chose to respond with welfare cuts – which were subsequently rejected by Labour MPs. She believes a larger buffer will contain the impact of market jitters on policymaking. Reeves said that by getting a grip on the finances, she hopes to convince investors to close the gap that emerged between the UK’s borrowing costs and those of other large economies at the time of Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget in 2022. “When Liz Truss and Kwazi Kwarteng did their mini-budget three years ago, our bond yields decoupled from other G7 economies and they are still at an elevated level compared to other countries. I want to bring us back in line.” She said that the UK now spends more than £100bn a year on interest alone – with much of it going to overseas investors. “If you say to people: ‘What would you like to spend more on?’ – they’re going to say schools, hospitals, police on our streets, parks and local facilities. “No one’s going to say: ‘We’re keen that we spend more on servicing our debt to US hedge funds.’ “And yet that is the item of spending that went up the most under the previous government, and there is absolutely nothing progressive about it. “I’m providing that confidence to people who buy government bonds that I’ve got a grip on the public finances. And if we can continue to do that, I am convinced we can bring down those borrowing costs.” Reeves flew into Washington presenting the UK as a “beacon of stability”. But the IMF’s latest forecasts, published as the annual meetings kicked off, showed UK consumers suffering the highest inflation rate in the G7 this year and next .",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/15/rachel-reeves-says-higher-taxes-on-wealthy-part-of-the-story-for-november-budget,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b395f1774e0a93b07a28094bf2a4005dad9468b/1986_82_4671_3737/master/4671.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a50bae6691c69acbaaa11ad12880e8ef",2025-10-15T18:15:51+00:00,f72e90433732e8988ba09a05dee8d863838f4310
0df921da47a6,The Guardian view on the China spy trial: an opportunity for Labour to prove it understands the threat from Beijing,,"N o single word describes the challenge that China poses for UK foreign policy. There is threat and opportunity; a requirement to engage and an imperative to be guarded. The Communist party in Beijing represses dissent and pursues its interests overseas with coercive nationalist determination. It is not a regime with which Britain can build a relationship based on common values. But China is also a superpower with near-monopoly control of some mineral resources and pre-eminence in important manufacturing supply chains . Trusting friendship is not an option; hostile rejection is unrealistic. It is not easy to manage relations through private diplomacy, let alone under public scrutiny. But Sir Keir Starmer’s government has looked especially awkward in its response to the collapse of a high-profile espionage case , involving the alleged transmission of secrets from inside parliament to Chinese officials. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against two men, a parliamentary researcher and a teacher working in China. Both deny wrongdoing. The CPS says a conviction could not be secured if China was not named in government witness statements as a threat to national security – ostensibly a requirement of the Official Secrets Act. Opposition parties have cried foul. There are ample policy papers and ministerial statements going back many years attesting to the threat China poses. The suspicion has been raised that political pressure was applied to drop the case through fear of offending Beijing and spoiling economic relations. Ministers reject that claim and accuse the Conservatives of failing to fix flaws in the Official Secrets Act when they were in power. In parliament on Wednesday, Kemi Badenoch said the whole affair “stinks of a cover-up”. The prime minister responded that the Tory leader was “slinging mud”. He committed to publish witness statements that, he says, support the government’s account of events. Something is clearly amiss if the CPS thought there was an espionage case to answer, but couldn’t bring it to trial. In a climate of endemic mistrust in politics, it would be prudent of Mrs Badenoch to beware leaping from scepticism to conspiracy theory. By the same token, if wider diplomatic and commercial anxieties really are unconnected to the case, the government should have been more transparent, earlier. Partisan rhetoric has heated the debate without shedding much light on the underlying issue. There is more consensus on this question than the tone of party-political exchanges in recent days suggests. In office, Conservative ministers, including Mrs Badenoch, picked their words carefully when describing the risks of overexposure to Chinese espionage and dependence on Chinese technology, often to the frustration of hawkish backbenchers . The suppression of political freedoms in Hong Kong was not opposed as robustly as pro-democracy activists there deserved. Managing relations with an assertive superpower is complex. Judicious language does not necessarily indicate naivety about the danger. But diplomatic protocol should not prevent candour about the limits to engagement with a regime that is often hostile to fundamental British interests. The current Labour government is not the first to send mixed signals on this point. If Sir Keir has a clear sense of how to strike the balance between trade with China and national security interests, ending confusion over the failed espionage case would be a good way to spell it out.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-china-spy-trial-an-opportunity-for-labour-to-prove-it-understands-the-threat-from-beijing,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a79554a4d49c6910ebdfce8afb5c41503f60548c/444_57_2974_2379/master/2974.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6a594708246981fb0d4d6a75ee0e6251",2025-10-15T17:30:42+00:00,671e7d35880cf7becf2c518a3e4b2e0628dc8f55
35250fa23a19,"A leaked memo, a Maga-style hat and a trail of broken pledges – it’s Labour’s great housing betrayal",,"I f the name Steve Reed means little to you, rest assured that is a pothole he is eager to fill. Having replaced Angela Rayner as housing secretary, he bounded around Labour conference last month dishing out Maga-red caps stamped with his credo “Build Baby Build!”. Headgear and slogan have both been filched from that very rightwing guy in the White House – because, like Robert Jenrick, Steve Reed is what happens when self-identified centrists turn populist. Imagine Donald Trump had, years ago, swerved TV fame to become instead ward councillor for Brixton Hill. Imagine if Trump had no towers, but knew his way round a Travelodge. Most of all, imagine this scene from the conference fringe, recounted by Inside Housing magazine: “Steve Reed skipped into the room only once the well-orchestrated chanting by his party faithful was deemed loud enough to the tune of We Built This City by Starship. He then took to the stage and proceeded to throw more signed and branded merchandise into the crowd, before cracking open a bottle of alcohol because ‘all builders need a beer’. “One sector professional’s response to the proceedings was ‘dear God’.” Steve Reed: he built this city, he built this city on rock’n’roll. Except there is no building, baby. Labour was elected last year on a pledge of 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament, yet in private, Reed’s officials already accept they will end up breaking that promise. Take London, where the government wants 88,000 homes finished before January. That goal was always a huge stretch but now it looks like a joke: so far this year ground has broken on just 3,248 new units. The figure comes from the consultancy Molior , which says that one in every six major housing projects is frozen: “schemes are halted, with the gates padlocked”. The shortfall is so vast as to sow panic in government and to push No 10 into a war-room exercise over a recent weekend where a team worked on a rescue package. The results will be public as soon as next week, when Reed unveils an emergency scheme, billed as getting London building again. I have seen a private memo circulated within the Ministry of Housing that reveals the measures and the thinking behind the measures. While they may help the big property developers on whom ministers rely, they will almost certainly heighten the very crisis in affordable housing that Labour vowed to fix. London is already infamous around the world for its inability to house ordinary Londoners, and this plan will add to the chaos already inflicted on families and local authorities. Sent last week, the memo details extensive discussions with senior executives at Barratt, Vistry and Berkeley – among other major housebuilders – for whom government officials rehearsed their plans. This privileged access appears to have been reserved almost exclusively for the property industry, with representatives of housing associations invited in further down the road while groups representing ordinary tenants, and even London councils, do not seem to have been involved at all. That fits with the logic of the plan, which centres on watering down builders’ commitments to provide affordable and social housing. When he was first elected as the capital’s mayor in 2016, Labour’s Sadiq Khan promised he would build homes for Londoners , not “gold bricks for overseas investors”. As a first step, he introduced a threshold: if builders reserved 35% of a development for affordable homes, their application would be fast-tracked. Affordable was loosely defined (technically, any housing at up to 80% of market value counts as “affordable”). Neither a target nor an obligation, it had the hallmark of New Labour compromise – an incentive for the market to do its bit. Yet under Keir Starmer, even New Labour can seem dangerously statist, and Reed’s department is seriously considering slashing that threshold to just 20% affordable homes, making building in London far more profitable. If that isn’t enough of a sweetener, half will be paid for out of public money, so the cash local authorities receive from the sale of council houses will now go into padding out developers’ profit margins. Reed plans other sweeteners, such as suspending the community levy developers have long paid for amenities such as a new GP surgery or a school. Looking at government calculations, that one giveaway alone could put around £1bn back in the pockets of wealthy developers. Not all these proposals may make it into final programme, but the direction is clear. “The key test is that developers welcome the package strongly on the day,” says the memo. The same industry that, as recently as the pandemic were raking in billions in profit, is now being ushered to the front of the queue by a Labour government that just last year promised “the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation” – another promise for the dustbin. One former insider at the department recalls sustained pressure from No 10 and the Treasury to bin the emphasis on social housing, which was always successfully resisted by Angela Rayner – who wielded the combined authority of deputy prime minister and deputy leader – and her housing minister Matthew Pennycook. Until the government’s personnel changed abruptly last month, that is. So much for high politics; the ground reality is of a housing crisis that just keeps getting bigger. Over 13,000 people slept rough in London in 2024-25, four times the number before David Cameron’s austerity regime. At the start of this year, 73,000 households across the capital were in temporary accommodation , including 90,000 children – so that on average at least one child in every classroom in London is homeless . The capital’s councils pay out £5.5m every day just to put them up in rooms that are too often cramped, ridden with mould and worse. None of this will be improved by these measures, as laid out here. More than one source believes developers will halt projects already under way, arguing they should be allowed to divert into more profitable housing. A source at the Greater London Authority estimates that up to 20,000 affordable homes already planned, some even part-built, could rapidly disappear. Over the longer term, says Duncan Bowie, a key architect of the London Plan under Ken Livingstone, the memo will take Londoners back to the housing policies of Boris Johnson. Think infinity pools in the sky, while thanks to the housing-welfare cuts brought in by George Osborne and not reversed by Rachel Reeves, lower-income Londoners are exiled hundreds of miles away from family and friends. In response to my questions, the housing ministry issued a short statement that reads in part: “We do not comment on leaks. No decisions have been made.” Ministers will probably argue that 20% of something is better than 35% of nothing – except London’s housing problem today is not primarily about over-regulation – it’s about the lack of demand. Wages are barely rising, interest rates are way off their post-crisis lows and house prices remain untenably high. As Molior put it: “No buyers = no construction starts”. Just a few months before council elections in London and elsewhere, a Labour government is about to unveil a scheme that shows who it values most – and it doesn’t look like ordinary Londoners. As Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing at Wandsworth’s Labour council, puts it: “This is rolling over for developers.” It’s not just Steve Reed’s baseball caps that look Trumpian.

b299e1ec846c,African Union suspends Madagascar as military leader set to be sworn in as president,,"Madagascar’s new military ruler will be sworn in as the country’s president on Friday, the military said on Wednesday, as the African Union suspended the island nation after a coup that ousted President Andry Rajoelina. The Indian Ocean nation has been plunged into its worst political upheaval in years after the elite Capsat army unit assumed power on Tuesday, moments after parliament voted to impeach Rajoelina, who appeared to have fled the country as street protests escalated. It becomes the latest former French colony to fall under military control since 2020, after coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon and Guinea. Capsat commander Col Michael Randrianirina, confirmed as president by the top court, said on Wednesday that the transition to civilian leadership would take under two years and include the restructuring of major institutions. “It wasn’t a coup, it was a case of taking responsibility because the country was on the brink of collapse,” he said, having pledged elections in 18 to 24 months and told local media that consultations were under way to appoint a prime minister and form a new government. The transition would be overseen by a committee of officers from the army, gendarmerie and police. Randrianirina “will be sworn in as president of the refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar during a solemn hearing of the high constitutional court” on 17 October, the country’s military rulers said in a statement published on social media by a state television station. Randrianirina has long been a vocal critic of Rajoelina’s administration and was reportedly imprisoned for several months in 2023 for plotting a coup. The swift takeover has drawn international concern. The African Union on Wednesday told AFP it was suspending Madagascar “with immediate effect”, while the UN said it was “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power”. France said in a statement that it was “essential that democracy, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law be scrupulously upheld”. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said all actors needed to “act with caution in this currently somewhat confusing situation”, while Russia called for “exercising restraint and preventing bloodshed”. The security body of regional SADC grouping – of which Rajoelina was holding the rotating presidency – also expressed concern. The capital, Antananarivo, remained calm late on Wednesday, though uncertainty lingered over what might happen next. A concert was held on the symbolic Place du 13 Mai square, in front of the city hall, where thousands of protesters and armed vehicles had clashed days earlier. The youth-led Gen Z movement that initiated the protests on 25 September over lack of water and energy before they later swelled into broader anger at the political elite have welcomed the intervention of Randrianirina. The colonel had said he was “ready to talk to the youth and we are ready to answer the call”, Gen Z said in a post on Facebook, reiterating its calls for “systemic change”. “We’re worried about what comes next, but we’re savouring this first victory that gave us hope,” 26-year-old Fenitra Razafindramanga, captain of Madagascar’s national rugby team, told AFP. In the northern city of Antsiranana, an entrepreneur who identified herself only as Muriella was relieved that Rajoelina was no longer in power. “It feels like we’ve just been released from prison,” she told AFP, adding: “This is also a message to his successor: learn from this and don’t make the same mistakes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/madagascar-to-swear-in-military-leader-as-president-on-friday,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ce4452165d4314e5951894bae31637222df5bb/1340_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82e96757acf6bfe1c6b1310c662ea645",2025-10-15T19:07:36+00:00,f9adbac95ed042019e0a717e29c761043358c8e0

The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision. The US president said he authorized the action for two main reasons. First, he claimed Venezuela had been releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, often crossing the border due to what he described as an open border policy. Trump did not specify which border they were crossing. The second reason, he said, was the large amount of drugs entering the US from Venezuela, much of it trafficked by sea. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joshua Lees on behalf of the Palestine Action Group launched a constitutional challenge against the state of NSW over police powers in March. The challenge came after the NSW government passed – among a suite of reforms in February aimed at curbing antisemitism – the places of worship bill, which gave police the power to move on protesters who are “in or near” a place of worship. During the hearing in June, lawyers for the Palestine Action Group had argued the “vagueness” of the legislation’s wording created the “chilling effect” of having neither protesters nor police officers able to determine the reach of the police’s move-on powers. The state of NSW had argued that the powers had an “obvious and legitimate purpose” of protecting religious communities trying to access a place of worship from physical obstruction, physical or verbal harassment, intimidation or incitement to fear.

On Wednesday evening, Victorian parliament’s upper house debated a motion by Ann-Marie Hermans to take note of a petition signed by 1,600 people calling for the renaming of Berwick Springs Lake to Guru Nanak Lake to be revoked. The petition argued the renaming did not involve proper consultation and created division within the multi-faith community. Hermans said the petition was not about “religion” or “race” but the lack of community consultation. The multicultural affairs minister, Ingrid Stitt , told parliament the renaming of the lake – a 2018 election commitment under former premier Daniel Andrews – reflected values that “unite us”: It’s important that our place names reflect the multiculturalism and diversity of our state.

A hospitality worker could not afford a single property in the ACT, only five in the Northern Territory, and just 80 across the whole of Victoria. The solution is clear. We need tax reform to stop pushing up the cost of housing. We need to build at least 25,000 new public and community homes each year – rentals that essential workers can actually afford. And we need stronger protections for renters, so people are not left at the mercy of an unfair system.

More Australians experiencing financial stress Real household income has grown between 2023 and 2024, after two years of declines, but around one in five people aged 15 and over are now experiencing financial stress – the highest in over a decade, new research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found. In 2024, real household income (median real equivalised household disposable income) was $1,464 per week; an increase of 3.2% since 2023 ($1,418) and 20% since 2009 ($1,215) – but this has mainly benefited wealthier Australians. Higher-income households, which have an annual disposable income above $122,000 had the fastest real income growth (3.5%), while the lowest income households (which on average make around $15,000 a year) had the slowest real income growth at 0.3%. More Australians are also experiencing financial stress. One in 20 (4.9%) people reported missing out on meals in 2023, the highest since data was first collected in 2001. Share Updated at 16.11 EDT New powers to crack down on crypto ATMs used for money laundering The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, will announce new powers to crack down on crypto ATMs and cryptocurrency that are used for money laundering and terrorism financing. Burke will address the National Press Club later today and will say that the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), which is in charge of stopping criminal abuse of the financial system, will have more power to restrict certain “high-risk products” including crypto ATMs. Australia has third-highest number of crypto ATMs in the world and Austrac estimates that 99% of crypto ATM transactions are cash deposits, which are a high risk for money laundering. The number of crypto ATMs in Australia skyrocketed in the past six years. Austrac says its jumped from 23 in 2019 to more than 1,800 in operation now. Burke will also announce powers to disrupt the use of “mule accounts” by money launderers – where criminals take over legitimate bank accounts, often bought or rented from international students or visa holders. There are significant money laundering, terrorism financing and serious crime risks associated with crypto ATMs. Australia has the highest number of CATMs in the region and the third-highest in the world. If a bank suspects mule activity, they will be able to check visa-holder status and use this to inform decisions about whether the account is being used by criminals. It’s about equipping banks with the right information to help them manage risk and prevent their accounts falling into the hands of criminals.

5edad22d4807,Adani denies claims it sold ‘below-market coal’ leading to Queensland missing out on hundreds of millions in royalties,,"Adani has consistently sold coal from its Queensland mine far below market rates, according to claims made in new analysis, potentially reducing the royalties owed to the state government by hundreds of millions of dollars. The research director at the Australia Institute, Rod Campbell, calculated that Adani sold thermal coal from its Carmichael mine at an average of just over $A100 a tonne during the 2023 to 2025 financial years – its first three full years of operation. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The period saw huge coal price spikes after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Australian benchmark prices surging above $A600/t in late 2022, before moderating. Even allowing for discounted prices for Adani’s lower-quality coal, Campbell said the difference between the “realised price and expected market price is huge”. “This discrepancy means that royalty payments were far lower than might have been expected.” Adani coal prices Adani has strongly rejected the findings. A spokesperson said the analysis assumptions “are wrong and rely on mismatched data, incorrect assumptions and back-of-a-napkin math”. “This is just the latest instalment in the anti-fossil fuel movement’s misinformation campaign to try to shut Australia’s coal export industry down,” the spokesperson said. The Australia Institute analysis argued that Adani would have potentially owed $625m in royalties over the 2023-25 financial years if its customer prices were closer to expected market prices, given higher royalty rates would have applied under the progressive system. Instead, it paid just under $230m in royalties during that time frame, according to its accounts, representing a near $400m differential. Royalties According to the Australia Institute, the biggest discrepancy occurs in 2022-2023 when Adani customers would have been expected to pay about $A282/t. This includes a 30% discount to take into account Carmichael’s lower-quality coal. Instead, Adani’s customers paid an average of $A102 a tonne, according to Campbell’s analysis. The calculations are based on Adani’s own customer revenue figures as well as coalmine production figures published by the Queensland government to ascertain a price per tonne. The figures are an approximation given there is a three-month misalignment between the Indian and Australian financial years. Adani does not publish its price per tonne figures. The coal, which is burned to produce electricity, is primarily exported to buyers in India and south-east Asia. Adani’s Australian operation, Bravus Mining and Resources, lists its customers as a mix of related parties and third parties – including Adani entities and other energy producers. In addition to mining, the sprawling Adani Group’s businesses include sea and airport management, electricity generation and transmission, natural gas, food, weapons and infrastructure. The Adani spokesperson said that the mine had paid all coal royalties owed. “We’re proud to operate in regional Queensland and provide secure jobs and opportunities for local businesses that drive economic and social prosperity in the communities our people call home,” the spokesperson said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Queensland uses a tiered royalty system, with rates increasing as commodity prices rise. According to the analysis, Adani’s average annual coal prices did not move much above the $A100/t base rate during those three years, which largely attracts the base royalty rates. Queensland’s base 7% royalty rate is applied to coal sold up to $A100/t. While one possible reason for the discrepancy could be that Adani had long-term contracts in place, Campbell – who previously provided expert evidence in court in a case involving Adani’s project approval – argued this was unlikely given the location of coal sales varied considerably over the years. The Queensland government recently secured a new royalty deferment deal with Adani, which builds on one struck under the former government. The details are confidential. While a deferment deal might result in Adani paying lower royalties than expected, it would not change the prices it sells its coal. The director of Climate Energy Finance, Tim Buckley, said the Australia Institute modelling was as “accurate as possible” for an external third party to conduct and that it should prompt the Queensland and federal governments to investigate. Buckley is a former investment banker who has previously provided expert evidence in a court case involving Adani. The Australia Institute findings follow research by Guardian Australia that found the Indian conglomerate paid zero corporate tax from its Carmichael operations since opening in the 2021-22 financial year, raising questions over how beneficial the project is to the national economy. Adani pledged just over a decade ago to plough $22bn in taxes and royalties into the Australian economy, although the mine is smaller than once anticipated. Adani’s Queensland operations, whereby coal is sent through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, is among the most politically divisive projects in Australia. It started assembling coal for export shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, which sent prices surging amid concerns global energy supplies would be disrupted.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/adani-denies-claims-it-sold-below-market-coal-leading-to-queensland-missing-out-on-hundreds-of-millions-in-royalties,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa5bb8e2893491223a122d503cd82a9b2faf3fed/0_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=231adc51aba8ab1565d998f10e2c46c5",2025-10-15T19:00:45+00:00,0ed5a6e3b79c7e715452305922decbf16af036ff
e627013ab920,Hamburg man charged with murder over US teen’s livestreamed death,,"A man accused of luring children worldwide into a sadistic online abuse network has been charged by German prosecutors with hundreds of crimes, including murder, for the livestreamed death of a 13-year-old American. Using the pseudonym “White Tiger”, the 21-year-old man from Hamburg is alleged to have victimised more than 30 children with online sexual abuse, manipulation and exploitation as a part of a virtual network of abusers known as “764” . He allegedly coerced a US boy, 13, into killing himself in 2022, which was broadcast via live stream. Authorities said the crimes had occurred between January 2021, when the suspect was 16 years old, and September 2023. Prosecutors in Hamburg announced 204 criminal charges against the German-Iranian man, including allegations of committing one murder and five attempted murders as an “indirect perpetrator”. “White Tiger” would find vulnerable children and adolescents in online chats or games, develop a bond to groom them for abuse, then exploit them into producing sexual content and harming themselves on video, authorities said. The man was arrested at his parents’ home in June. Authorities said at the time they had identified eight victims of “White Tiger”, aged between 11 and 15 and from Germany, England, Canada and the US. The case has prompted questions about whether German authorities could have acted sooner and prevented some of the abuse. The Zeit newspaper reported that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US had alerted German authorities in 2021 to an apparently Hamburg-based predator using the name “White Tiger”. According to Zeit, NCMEC provided a roughly 40-page document containing chat transcripts from the online platform Discord in which “White Tiger” demanded photos from two young girls, urging them to harm themselves and suggesting they take their own lives. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

dd9888a077d5,Challenges remain for aid distribution in Gaza City despite ceasefire with Israel,,"Even if the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza opens on Thursday, NGOs face big challenges distributing supplies to Gaza City and its surroundings in the north, the areas worst hit by hunger, experts say. Key roads are virtually impassable due to the massive destruction across the devastated territory – or are still controlled by Israeli forces. Any truck that breaks down is likely to be instantly looted. Zikim, the main entry point to the north of the territory, devastated by two years of war with Israel, has been closed for several weeks, and Israeli officials have told NGOs in Gaza that there are no immediate plans to open the crossing, aid workers said. Gaza City was the target of a major Israeli offensive launched in August that was still under way when the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was signed a week ago. “Any opening of a crossing into Gaza is welcome, but we need to make sure we can reach people where they are,” said Katy Crosby, senior director of policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps, an NGO. “If we don’t see more access, we will just be maintaining the status quo at best. We won’t see a reduction in looting and we will see more displacement as people move to where there is more aid.” Destruction in the north has been massive, with entire towns including Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in ruins as well as many of the outlying areas of Gaza City. Witnesses said many of the estimated 300,000 people who have returned to the north from the overcrowded coastal zone in the south where they had been sheltering during the Israeli offensive were now “camping” among the ruins of their homes, often without any shelter and with limited food or water. Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for Unicef, said the destruction in northern Gaza was “shocking”. “It is street after street, building after building … there is massive desperation for water. It’s pretty harrowing. We need all the crossings open,” Ingram, who was in Gaza City earlier this week, said. Amjad al-Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network and based in Gaza City, said the needs in what used to be the territory’s bustling commercial and cultural hub were “immense”. “People have this optimism and hope but there needs to be quick improvement on the crossings. We didn’t witness any significant change on the ground yet,” al-Shawa said. “We are still getting a very limited amount of aid [and] we are just beginning now to understand the level of destruction. So many streets are just full of rubble … there is almost no home that is safe. There is damage and unexploded bombs everywhere.” Some humanitarian aid has reached Palestinians in Khan Younis since the ceasefire. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images On Saturday, aid agencies said small quantities of vital cooking gas entered Gaza for the first time in seven months, along with consignments of flour, rice and fresh vegetables. The new supplies sent prices in markets tumbling. Under the 20-point plan proposed by Donald Trump and currently under further negotiation after the successful conclusion of its first phase, Gaza should receive “full aid” at the same level as during the short-lived ceasefire in January when 600 trucks entered the territory daily. In the central town of Deir al-Balah, Najla Jundiya, 36, said there had been some improvement since the ceasefire. “The markets are full of food, vegetables, and fruits, although the prices are still high and not affordable for everyone,” Jundiya said. “Our most important needs now, especially with the approach of winter, are to have a tent to protect us from the cold and winter clothes because the markets do not have enough clothes for us or, if they exist, they are very few and very expensive.” Nine UN-supported bakeries in central and southern Gaza have restarted operations since the ceasefire. Trucks were reported to have entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel to Gaza during Wednesday, though exact numbers were unclear. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that Wednesday’s aid deliveries would include food, medical supplies, fuel, cooking gas and equipment to repair vital infrastructure. “Humanitarian aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing and other crossings after Israeli security inspection,” an Israeli security official said. But counting the number of trucks could be misleading, warned Crosby, of Mercy Corps. “We need to know what is in the trucks and how full they are for it to be a really meaningful metric,” she said. Trucks carrying food aid and fuel, accompanied by a UN team, pass through the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Wednesday. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Commercial operators are sending convoys of trucks loaded with chocolate, fizzy drinks and snacks, which have little nutritional value, while emergency treatments for children or others who have gone without adequate food for two years are scarce. In Gaza City, only seven nutritional outpatient clinics are functioning, compared with 45 in July. Many agencies have millions of dollars worth of supplies stockpiled around Gaza waiting to go in. Unrwa, the UN agency working with Palestinians across the region for decades, has three months’ worth of food for everyone in Gaza in place ready to be transported. “We have the supplies, the tools and the skills … we just need the access,” said one aid worker, recently returned from Gaza. Trump’s proposed plan specifies that “full” aid should enter Gaza and be distributed through the UN and the Red Crescent, without interference from either Hamas or Israel. This appears to exclude the controversial Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , which began operations in May, leading to chaotic scenes and hundreds of deaths as crowds of aid-seekers gathered around its distribution sites. Aid officials in Gaza told the Guardian that three of the GHF’s sites were no longer operative and two others were in the process of being dismantled. A GHF spokesperson denied the reports, saying that only one site had been dismantled and that the organisation was committed to its mission “to deliver aid consistently and directly to as many families in Gaza as possible, for however long it takes.” Additional reporting by Seham Tantesh in Gaza City",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/challenges-remain-for-aid-distribution-in-gaza-city-despite-ceasefire-with-israel,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6eb1921e58b8ee583ad871a1a8b843bc4715225/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9625cc5098dd5b3d9271daef35b4d0e1",2025-10-15T19:04:02+00:00,806fc887ec38ef40da451a56c8dd926ef0d03943
69ad387efa80,"Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti assaulted by Israeli prison guards, son says",,"Palestine’s most popular leader, Marwan Barghouti, was beaten unconscious by Israeli prison guards and his family fears for his life, his son has said, citing evidence given by former Palestinian detainees released this week as part of the ceasefire deal. Arab Barghouti said his 66-year-old father was assaulted by eight guards on 14 September as he was being transferred between Ganot and Megiddo prisons. Barghouti said that five of the Palestinian prisoners released and deported to Egypt by the Israeli authorities on Monday had heard the Palestinian leader’s account of his treatment when he arrived in Megiddo prison. “What we know is that while they were transferring my father, they stopped along the way and eight security guards within the prison authority that worked for the prison authority started beating my father up in different ways, by kicking him, by [throwing] him on the ground, by punching him, focusing on the head area, chest area and legs as well,” he said, adding that his father later told fellow prisoners he lost consciousness as a result of the attack. “The released detainees say that when he came to Megiddo he could barely walk for days.” Barghouti said it was the fourth time his father had been beaten over the past two years. The Palestinian leader has been held in solitary confinement since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, which ignited the Gaza war. Barghouti is a member of the Fatah party, a bitter rival of Hamas. The Asra Media Office , which covers Palestinian prisoner issues, said Barghouti “lost consciousness and suffered fractures in four ribs as a result of the beating”. The alleged beating followed a prison visit to Marwan Barghouti by the Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir in August. Ben Gvir, a member of an extreme right party who has past convictions from Israeli courts for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist organisation, taunted Barghouti in a video clip published at the time. According to Arab Barghouti, Ben Gvir also showed the 66-year-old prisoner a picture of an electric chair, and told him he deserved to be executed. In a statement quoted in Maariv newspaper on Wednesday, Ben Gvir denied the assault allegations, but added that he was “proud that [Barghouti’s] situation has changed radically during my tenure – play time is over, holiday camps are over. “The murderer Barghouti knows that terrorists like him are treated harshly today, so he invents fake news to incite his despicable terrorist comrades who left him behind as part of the [ceasefire] deal,” Ben Gvir said, adding he gave his full support to the “fighters of the prison service”, who he said were performing “sacred work”. Barghouti consistently tops polls as the most popular leader among Palestinians. He has been in prison for more than 20 years after being convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed, and sentenced to five life sentences plus 40 years. The trial was criticised as deeply flawed by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal that took effect over the weekend, 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences were released, and most of them deported to Egypt. The Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu vetoed Barghouti’s inclusion on the list of prisoners to be freed as part of the deal. “My father represents the voice of reason,” Arab Barghouti said. “He is the most popular Palestinian leader, but at the same time, he has a political vision that is accepted by the international community that can contribute to the stability of the region, which is a two-state solution. “He’s been a vocal supporter of the two-state solution for more than three decades. I think the fact that the Israeli government insisted that he’s not part of the deal is a clear declaration that they’re not looking for a credible, legitimate Palestinian leader. They want us to stay divided.” Additional reporting by Quique Kierszenbaum in Jerusalem",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/palestinian-leader-marwan-barghouti-assaulted-by-israeli-prison-guards-son-says,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9b29e9540dea804c18778aa0684e84462d5f62/751_886_3145_2516/master/3145.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=158e89dc1ded133ef3f0ab88d9c22fb9",2025-10-15T18:56:10+00:00,13459892277ba57abde98860d1a7eb4ee5a75fb2
24a007e07368,Case dropped against Met police officer who shot unarmed man,,"The family of a man shot dead by a police officer during a foiled prison break have accused Scotland Yard of evading accountability after a case against the marksman was thrown out. The officer, known only as W80, shot Jermaine Baker as police stopped a plot to snatch two prisoners from a van near Wood Green crown court in 2015. Misconduct proceedings against W80 began last week in London after almost a decade of legal wrangling over the case. He was eventually accused of breaching professional standards over the use of force. But on Wednesday the case was dismissed after the panel’s chair, Chris McKay, ruled there was no case to answer. He said the panel’s full reasons for the decision would be issued in the next five days. Baker’s family said there was no justification for the killing and questioned how W80’s action had escaped scrutiny. The police watchdog said the case has dented public confidence in police accountability. Baker, a father of two from Tottenham, north London, was shot at close range by counter-terrorism specialist firearms officer W80, who thought Baker was reaching for a gun. Baker, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of a stolen Audi A6, was unarmed. An imitation firearm was later found in the back of the Audi, the misconduct hearing previously heard. W80 was in the “highest tier” of armed officers in the country and had been trained to carry a gun since 1998. Prosecutors said in 2017 that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges over the shooting, but the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) directed that the officer should face misconduct proceedings, prompting a lengthy legal dispute between the watchdog and the Metropolitan police. In 2023, the supreme court found in the IOPC’s favour , paving the way for a misconduct hearing. There was also a public inquiry into Baker’s death which concluded in 2022 that he had been lawfully killed. Margaret Smith, the mother of Baker, said she was not surprised by the decision. She said: “Since the day almost 10 years ago that my son Jermaine was shot and killed by W80, the Metropolitan police has taken every possible step to avoid their officer or their organisation from facing scrutiny and accountability for his death. “That included going all the way to the supreme court to avoid W80 facing disciplinary proceedings. Against that background, my family and I never had any faith in this gross misconduct hearing.” The IOPC director, Amanda Rowe, said: “This case highlights the complexities of the police accountability system, which leave it open to legal challenges and lengthy delays that have a detrimental impact on the confidence of both the public and the police officers involved. “We have long called for a review of end-to-end processes and said that the complaints and disciplinary system need fundamental reform.” Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, welcomed the decision but accepted that the system needed reform. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, he said: “Officers will be encouraged by the fact this has been dismissed – it will give them some confidence that the right decision has been reached in the end.” He said W80 had endured a “decade of legal madness” in which his life “was put on hold”. Rowley added: “We were very clear with the IOPC that we weren’t sure this hearing was necessary, but the more important message today is the system itself, the regulations which hold police to account do not have the right balance. “They’re exploited too often by criminals and their legal teams to undermine police officers’ confidence, and we need a system which looks fairly at split-second decisions taken by officers in the most difficult operational moments.” He urged the government to act on an independent review of police accountability which reported to the Home Office earlier this year, adding: “Until we have a more just and more timely system, it will continue to crush the spirit and confidence of good officers who go out there every day to police London and to keep us all safe.” Quick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

920cfa3f1b32,PPE firm linked to Michelle Mone misses deadline to repay £122m,,"A company linked to the former Conservative peer Michelle Mone has failed to pay the government any of the £122m ordered by a high court judgment for supplying unusable personal protective equipment during the Covid pandemic. Mrs Justice Cockerill ruled that PPE Medpro must, by a deadline of 4pm on 15 October, return the money it was paid by the Department of Health and Social Care for 25m sterile surgical gowns under a contract awarded in June 2020. Reacting just before 5pm, the health secretary, Wes Streeting , said PPE Medpro had failed to meet the deadline and the government would pursue the company for payment. The DHSC said that interest, which has been running on the £122m from when the PPE gowns were rejected as unusable in late 2020, was now £23.7m – making the total owed almost £146m. “At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers’ hard-earned cash,” said Streeting. “PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay – they still owe us over £145m, with interest now accruing daily. “We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong – in our NHS.” Interest would now accumulate at an annual rate of 8%, the DHSC said. Questions remain over how the government can get its money back , as the company, owned by Mone’s husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, was left with little money, and was put into administration on 30 September, the day before the judgment was handed down. A spokesperson for Barrowman and Mone has said that the “consortium partners of PPE Medpro”, a reference to three intermediary companies involved in the supply of gowns, were “prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government”. Labour appeared not to have engaged with this suggestion of a discussion about a settlement, and was waiting for full payment to be made by the deadline. The DHSC awarded the £122m gowns contract to PPE Medpro, and another worth £80.85m for face masks – a total of £203m – after Mone first approached the then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove in May 2020. The contracts were processed via the “VIP lane”, operated by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government during the pandemic, which gave high priority to people with political connections. Mone was appointed to the House of Lords by David Cameron in 2015. She and Barrowman denied through their lawyers for years that they were involved in PPE Medpro. In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. In December 2023 Mone admitted in a BBC interview that the couple had lied, and they confirmed their involvement in the company. Barrowman acknowledged that he had been paid more than £60m and transferred money into the trust; the couple said that his children were beneficiaries as well.

3e07d07e80f8,US Capitol police investigating flag with swastika in Republican representative’s office – report,,"US Capitol police are reportedly investigating after a US flag bearing a swastika was discovered inside the office of Republican House member Dave Taylor of Ohio . The image, obtained by Politico , shows a modified flag featuring red and white stripes arranged in the form of a swastika – which is virtually synonymous with the Nazis’ genocidal regime. The flag was displayed on what appears to be a cubicle wall behind Angelo Elia, one of Taylor’s staff members, during a virtual meeting. Other items pinned nearby include a pocket constitution and a congressional calendar. It remains unclear whether Elia had any connection to the display. “I am aware of an image that appears to depict a vile and deeply inappropriate symbol near an employee in my office,” Taylor said in a statement to the Cincinnati Enquirer . “The content of that image does not reflect the values or standards of this office, my staff, or myself, and I condemn it in the strongest terms. Upon learning of this matter, I immediately directed a thorough investigation alongside Capitol Police, which remains ongoing. No further comment will be provided until it has been completed.” According to his office, the flag was discovered on Tuesday afternoon inside Taylor’s suite in the Cannon building on Capitol Hill, Politico reported. The congressman suspects the act was “foul play or vandalism”, his spokesperson said. When contacted by the Guardian for comment, an automatic response from the US Capitol police public information office was sent that said the office is “closed for routine business” during the funding-related federal government shutdown that began on 1 October. “The office will reopen when the federal government is funded,” the response said. The discovery follows a report from Politico published on Tuesday detailing a Telegram chat in which Young Republican leaders exchanged racist comments and slurs, mocked the Holocaust, and expressed admiration for Nazi ruler Adolf Hitler . skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The exposed chat has since been met with major backlash throughout the US, with some who participated being called to resign and at least one member having a job offer revoked.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/capitol-us-flag-swastika-republican-dave-taylor,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a63cd39335caef9dfcaa12cacd509aa9cbe8024/165_0_3661_2928/master/3661.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b01301f26d0b01a4f65bd92d20f3ec30",2025-10-15T21:16:51+00:00,d3619479d0e4149b972a50438fbd16da1c6e5689
dcea7ed5d2c4,‘He may be watching’: Mamdani on Fox News speaks directly to Trump,,"Zohran Mamdani , the leading candidate to be the next mayor of New York, stepped into the lion’s den on Wednesday when he sat for an interview with Fox News, the rightwing news organization that has spent weeks demonizing him and his democratic socialist goals. Speaking to host Martha MacCallum, Mamdani was asked about funding for his proposals, which include freezing increases on rent-stabilized apartments, providing free buses and offering free childcare – and whether other services would be cut to achieve those goals. “I don’t think we have to cut,” Mamdani said. “I’ve spoken about raising taxes on the wealthiest. And, frankly, this is an issue that we have here in New York City, and, frankly, even across this country.” Mamdani said he had spoken to people who voted for Donald Trump in New York who told him it was the “cost of living” that “drove them to vote” for the president. Mamdani said that, despite that, “what we’re seeing time and time again is we’re more focused on the question of billionaires and the most profitable corporations than we are on people who can’t even afford to make ends meet in the city”. Following his surprise victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, Mamdani has for months led the polls to be New York’s next mayor. A survey released by Quinnipiac last week showed Mamdani winning 46% of the vote to the former New York governor’s 33%. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, was at 22%. That rise has brought attention from outlets such as Fox News, which has closely covered Mamdani, sometimes publishing multiple news stories on him a day. Jesse Watters, the network’s primetime host, has been a frequent critic , describing Mamdani as a “communist”, which he is not, and calling him “Kamala Harris with a beard”, while Sean Hannity suggested that the rise of Mamdani, who is Muslim, is evidence that “an extremism is taking root right before your very eyes”. In an interview that rehashed several rightwing critiques of Mamdani, MacCallum suggested he may lack the qualifications for the role. “President Trump said that you never worked a day in your life,” MacCallum told Mamdani, before asking what qualifies him to run the city. In response, Mamdani spoke directly into the camera, alluding to how the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, bowed to pressure from the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration crackdowns – before the Trump-led justice department dropped a federal corruption case against him. “I want to take this moment, because you spoke about President Trump, and he may be watching right now, and I just want to speak directly to the president,” Mamdani said. “I will not be a mayor like Mayor [Eric] Adams, who will call you to figure out how to stay out of jail. I won’t be a disgraced governor like Andrew Cuomo, who will call you to ask how to win this election. I can do those things on my own. I will, however, be a mayor who is ready to speak at any time to lower the cost of living. “That’s the way that I’m going to lead this city. That’s the partnership I want to build, not only with Washington DC, but [with] anyone across this country.” The interview came as Mamdani prepared for a debate with Cuomo and Sliwa on Thursday night. Adams suspended his re-election campaign in late September. Cuomo, who has centered his campaign on reducing crime, will likely seek to contrast his decades of experience in politics with Mamdani’s newcomer status. The former governor, who resigned in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, has run numerous ads attacking Mamdani. The issue of the Israel-Hamas peace deal is likely to come up, given Cuomo’s strong support for Israel and Mamdani’s opposing stance. Mamdani has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza and called the bombing of the territory a “genocide”. Mamdani was asked questions about the region on Wednesday, including whether he would give credit to Trump for the fledgling deal. Mamdani, stressing that his focus would be on New York rather than international politics, said he was thankful for the ceasefire, adding: “I have hope that it will actually endure and that it will be lasting.” “I think it’s too early to [give credit],” Mamdani said. “But if it proves to be something that is lasting, something that is durable, then I think that that’s where you give credit.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/zohran-mamdani-fox-news-trump,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/048ef463f5187da0964930616cd4832d5f9a78e5/213_0_3052_2441/master/3052.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd3ae6b5ee242630c77286fa0dcf29d1",2025-10-15T21:12:45+00:00,bc58b13bbf7f846f84dcc26fb47adbc82e61ed75
23a4af1953fd,Pentagon reporters have now turned in their badges – but plan to keep reporting,,"Pentagon reporters who declined to sign a new set of policies that press advocates and news organizations denounced as incompatible with the tenets of journalism were set to return their press badges by 5pm on Wednesday, ending decades of history of robust in-house coverage at the world’s largest military headquarters. In the hours leading up to the deadline, journalists worked furiously to pack up their workspaces in two media rooms, with hallways filled to the brim with boxes and books and other souvenirs of decades of daily coverage. One veteran Pentagon correspondent – who was not authorized to comment on the record – spoke to the Guardian as they headed to the complex to collect their belongings. They said they normally take the subway to work but drove today “because we have so much crap that we need to take back”. Those who raced to pack up their belongings also began thinking about how they would now cover the Pentagon without the direct access that many have relied upon for years. Current and former Pentagon correspondents who spoke with the Guardian said that coverage would undoubtedly suffer from a lack of proximity to administration decision-makers – though many are intent on proving that the restrictions won’t stop the work, with some even saying they plan to take a more aggressive tack. Under guidelines set by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth , a former Fox News host who has regularly mocked the media, the Pentagon has gradually cut back on access for journalists, booting some television networks from their dedicated workspaces and shutting down the briefing room that many used as a workaround. Forcing journalists to sign a lengthy set of new guidelines that put limits on their reporting activities was seen as the latest – but most significant – move in that direction. In particular, many journalists were unwilling to agree to strict rules on the “solicitation” of information from defense employees, with vague language guiding how exactly reporters would be able to get the material they needed to do their jobs. Despite partisan divisions that often pit pundits on networks such as Fox News and CNN against each other, the country’s five major television networks all signed a joint statement on Tuesday pledging not to sign the agency’s new guidelines, which they said “threatens core journalistic principles”. But the news organizations pledged: “We will continue to cover the U.S. military as each of our organizations has done for many decades, upholding the principles of a free and independent press.” The veteran Pentagon correspondent said they “believe that coverage is going to take a hit. “In the short and medium term, it’s going to reduce the number of probing stories we would have done,” the person said. But, they added, “long term, I think we as reporters will figure out ways around it … I’m also sort of motivated as well, because once this happens it’s like, I’m going to go really hard now and try to prove that we can do our jobs without being there.” In particular, reporters worry about the lag time in getting answers to questions about fast-moving developments. When urgent news from abroad comes in, reporters used to be able to race to the offices of press officials to quickly seek clarity and comment. Now, many will be forced to wait by their phone and email. There are also concerns about Pentagon officials clamming up, considering that the new guidelines state specifically that military members “face potentially severe consequences for disclosing non-public information without proper authorization”, with “criminal liability” mentioned as a possible recourse. “I do hope there are as many probing stories, but I think the chilling effect of Hegseth’s move isn’t just going to be limited to reporters, it’s going to have a chilling effect on officials as well,” the Pentagon correspondent said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A third Pentagon correspondent said they “will definitely be more aggressive going forward” in covering the agency, spending less time on stories the Hegseth administration wants the press to cover. Some reporters are hopeful that they will still be able to enter the building by securing day passes for access. (Asked whether reporters who declined to sign the agreement will be eligible for day passes, a Pentagon spokesperson said: “We have nothing further to provide for you at the moment.”) “I don’t think anybody has a hard and firm answer of what life looks like going forward,” the second Pentagon reporter said. The Atlantic was one of the many news organizations (including the Guardian) that declined to sign the new protocols. Two Atlantic correspondents were slated to hand over their badges. “I think having journalists in the building as representatives of the American public is important,” said Griff Witte, who oversees national security and defense coverage as the Atlantic’s managing editor. “There’s a basic level of accountability and transparency that is important for the public; it’s important for the press; and it’s important for the military. It’s unfortunate that it’s come to this point, but it’s not going to stop us from doing our work.” Barbara Starr, who spent decades covering the Pentagon for CNN before retiring in 2022, said she expected that Hegseth would regret the loss of coverage that will come from the policy change. As of now, only the conservative One America News has explicitly said it will sign the agreement and remain in the building. (The conservative website the Federalist has also indicated it will sign, with editor Mollie Hemingway saying in a post on Twitter/X that the publication would cover the publication “both on-site and from a distance”.) “The press corps will do everything it can to overcome all of this,” Starr said. “I think it’s going to fire up reporters to find ways and make sure they can still do their jobs, but it’s very sad business. The Pentagon press corps has traveled to every combat zone in the world. To be regarded as anything less than professional in their jobs is sad business.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/pentagon-press-reporting-policy,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2a99af55447019044f972a74597402f41ff04b/0_0_4492_3592/master/4492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71ef70ee58754be892862b9794e8d798",2025-10-15T21:00:47+00:00,5fb373319ebd9b6926f970deec5cb2f3c33a049f
cd9142cfddfc,‘My vote is my voice’: protesters fight for democracy as Trump casts shadow,,"W earing a T-shirt proclaiming “We won’t Black down”, Wanda Mosley had made the trip from Atlanta. “I had to be here because the Voting Rights Act is on life support,” the 55-year-old explained. “Today the court will synthesise the arguments and decide if they’re going to kill it – or allow it to live .” Mosley was among a few hundred protesters who gathered in warm October sunshine outside the supreme court on Wednesday. Inside the building, whose facade was obscured by scaffolding, justices were weighing arguments in a case involving Louisiana electoral districts and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. From afar, it might seem like a dry debate over an arcane law enacted by Congress half a century ago. But to those gathered at the court steps, most of whom were Black, there was a palpable consciousness that the legacy of civil rights giants such as Thurgood Marshall , Martin Luther King and John Lewis was on the line. Speakers noted that the Voting Rights Act had been a landmark law intended to prevent racial discrimination in voting. Undercutting it would reverse decades of progress. People held aloft signs that said “Black voters matter”, “Build Black political power”, “Fight for fair maps”, “Fight like hell!”, “It’s about us”, “My vote is my voice”, “Protect people, not power”. One said, “Protect our vote” around a photo of Lewis, the Georgia congressman who died five years ago. Donald Trump cast a shadow. An African American man waved a black-and-white flag that declared: “Fuck Trump and fuck you for voting for him.” A white woman carried a sign with a mocking cartoon image of the president and the slogan: “Trump’s afraid of free and fair elections.” Another held a sign that referenced Marshall, the first African American supreme court justice, and current justice Clarence Thomas , a conservative who is also African American. “Thurgood is watching you, Clarence,” it said. The back of the sign added: “Stop legalizing Trump’s race war.” There were chants of “Power to the people” and “We shall not be moved”. Songs including Sam Cooke’s A Change Is Gonna Come, Common and John Legend’s Glory and Jill Scott’s Golden boomed from loudspeakers. Cliff Albright , a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, admitted mixed feelings to the crowd: “There’s a part of me that gets sad at the impending death of this thing that has meant so much. I feel that sadness. There’s a part of me that feels weak, that feels small as I stand outside this huge building with so much history.” But Albright also insisted on hope, referencing Lewis’s role in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965, where he led peaceful protesters across the Edmund Pettus Bridge . “When we believe, we got the power to move mountains, we got the power to cross the bridge in a city called Selma and changed the course of history. “We got the power to make good trouble and we’ve got the power to move this court. This court ain’t nothing but another mountain for us to move. We’ve got that kind of power but we’ve got to believe, y’all. ” A great cheer went up when Janai Nelson , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who had been arguing on behalf of a group of Black voters, emerged from the court building and descended the steps that have witnessed many past triumphs. Two white women in police uniform and sunglasses looked on. Nelson struck an optimistic tone, telling the gathering: “We believe in the future of this multiracial democracy. We believe that, no matter what assaults and attacks we are currently facing, the right to vote is still the lifeblood of our democracy and that it must be protected at all costs. “And we know that the law is on our side. We know that if these justices follow their own words, we will prevail in this case and so that is the argument that we made today .” Speakers framed the legal fight as the latest chapter in a long, generational struggle for civil rights, frequently invoking the movement’s heroes. Terri Sewell , a Democratic congresswoman who represents Alabama’s seventh congressional district, which includes her home town of Selma, said: “I want to remind all of you of what John Lewis said on his very last time on that bridge in Selma. “John’s body was riddled with cancer but he stood up tall and strong at the apex of that bridge and he said with a very strong voice: ‘Never give up. Never give in. Keep the faith and let’s keep our eyes on the prize.’” Alanah Odoms , executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, cited King’s “promissory note” analogy from the March on Washington, stating that “America had defaulted on that promise” and that generations later the question remains: “When will this country make good on what it put down on paper?” As the crowd dispersed, Mosley, the activist from Atlanta, lingered a while and reflected on why she had come. “It’s frustrating because I’m as American as anybody else,” she said. “I’m a descendant of enslaved Africans that literally built this country. “I deserve to have unfettered rights to vote, and I deserve to have representation that lives in my neighborhood, that comes from my community and knows what our community needs.

e2a14b0afc06,"Energy bills likely to rise by 20% in next four years, says Britain’s biggest supplier",,"Britain’s biggest energy supplier has told MPs that bills are on track to climb by a fifth in the next four years, even if wholesale markets plummet, because of the rising cost of government policies. An executive at Octopus Energy said household energy bills were likely to rise by 20% unless the government took radical action to address the burden of increasing “non-commodity costs”, even in a scenario where wholesale electricity prices fell by half. Rachel Fletcher, its director for regulation and economics, made the stark warning before MPs at a select committee hearing on Wednesday. Fletcher, who has held senior positions at Britain’s energy and water industry regulators, said “serious and urgent consideration” was needed to address the rise in non-commodity costs, which include levies paid through bills to support upgrades to gas and electricity networks, running the energy system and subsidising low-carbon power projects. This could include delaying investments that were not needed by the UK energy system in the short term, she added. Fletcher appeared before the committee alongside senior executives from Britain’s biggest energy suppliers. Chris Norbury, the chief executive of E.On UK, said the supplier’s own modelling had suggested that even if the wholesale price was zero bills would still be where they were today because of the increase in non-commodity costs. A government spokesperson said: “We categorically reject this speculation. Wholesale gas costs for households remain 75% higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the main reason energy bills remain high.” ​”The only way to bring down energy bills for good is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, which will get the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power that we control,” the spokesperson said. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has repeatedly blamed the global gas market for rising energy bills , and has said breaking the country’s reliance on gas-fired power plants would help to reduce bills by up to £300 a year by 2030. The typical household energy bill under the government’s price cap has climbed to £1,755 a year for the average dual-fuel customer this winter, despite market prices falling in recent months. The cap is now just over £500 a year higher than in the winter before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated already increasing gas market prices. However, only about £200 of this higher cap can be directly attributed to the wholesale cost of energy. Other costs that have risen over recent years include the price of upgrading Britain’s energy networks, which has increased by more than £140 annually in the last four years to £396 a year under the cap. Policy costs, which include supporting low-carbon electricity projects, have climbed by £86 a year to £215 under the current price cap. “It’s time we got this burden under control,” Fletcher said. “There’s no budgetary control of this and yet it all ends up on household bills or contributing to making our electricity some of the most expensive in the industrialised world. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

c04b5d8bad24,‘The city that draws the line’: one Arizona community’s fight against a huge datacenter,,"A company’s opaque plan to build a huge datacenter outside Tucson, Arizona has roiled the desert city over the past few months, the latest US community to push back as tech companies aggressively seek to build out infrastructure for cloud computing and to power the AI boom. The proposed datacenter, known as Project Blue, would span 290 acres in Pima county, and become the biggest development ever in the county, or anywhere in the southern part of the state. The $3.6bn project wasn’t on most Tucsonans’ radar until 17 June, when the county board of supervisors narrowly agreed to sell and rezone a parcel of land just south-east of town to the developer Beale Infrastructure. The San Francisco-based company hoped to get the project annexed by the city, a necessary step for it to be supplied by the public utility, Tucson Water. But since the parcel sale agreement, the proposed center has faced stiff pushback from a community upset over the enormous amounts of water and electricity it would require, and the lack of transparency with which the developers and some in local government have pursued the project. Conflict over the project made what is normally a sleepy time for Tucson politics – the city council is off in July amid searing heat and, with luck, monsoon downpours – into “the craziest seven weeks I’ve seen in Tucson”, said Michael Bogan , an aquatic ecologist and hydrologist at the University of Arizona who has long worked in the area. A view of downtown Tucson. Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images The episode in Tucson illustrates the secretiveness and tenacity with which developers are rushing to build datacenters throughout the US, and the emotionally charged mix of issues that confront communities, weighing sometimes murky promises of economic incentives and jobs against effects on the environment and natural resources. In Memphis, Elon Musk’s xAI built one of the world’s biggest supercomputers, bringing in tax revenue to an economically depressed area, while also setting off a battle over air quality concerns related to the development’s methane turbines. Phoenix has one of the nation’s largest concentrations of datacenters, which keeps expanding, encouraged by tax incentives and local business leaders; local opposition and ordinances around noise pollution and water use are also on the rise. High-profile projects have been postponed or cancelled due to local pushback in recent months in northern Virginia, the nation’s biggest datacenter hub; in St Charles, Missouri ; and in several towns in Indiana . But in even more locations, datacenters are moving forward, often under a cloud of secrecy . Quest for AI computing power The project in Tucson is one of many emerging in the quest for AI computing power and to serve data-intensive companies. The project envisions a vast warehouse full of computers in the Sonoran desert, including $2.4bn worth of equipment. Community outrage over the project grew soon after the city council’s 17 June vote, and much of it centered around the issue of water. Datacenters use water in two ways: to maintain a steady humidity, and to cool off the hot computers, which is often accomplished by running cold water past the machines, consuming water in the form of steam. Communities throughout the US have seen groundwater depletion and contamination after datacenters crept up. Tucson has long embraced water conservation, and this protective ethos is more salient there than many other communities, said Ed Hendel, president of Sky Island AI , a Tucson-based company. As one example, the city treats wastewater and releases it to the Santa Cruz River, home to wildlife such as endangered fish. Hendel’s daily work relies on datacenters, but he said they should be built where they make sense. Placing water-guzzling warehouses of computers “in a hot desert is not a good starting point”, he said. “Putting them in a hot desert in the midst of a drought is even more absurd, because that water is precious.” A community meeting in Tucson to discuss the pros and cons of Project Blue. Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty Images Beale did not detail exactly how much water it would use and from where in the weeks after the June vote, even though it claimed the project would be “water positive”. In the absence of details, Bogan set out to analyze how the project would be water positive, projecting it would be most likely to use treated water that now flows into the Santa Cruz. But even if the company went that route, Bogan wrote in a white paper on 11 July, it could dry up significant portions of the river, harming the many plants and animals that live there. The city manager, Tim Thomure, acting as an intermediary between Beale and the public, released the first concrete details about the project’s planned water use in mid-July after Bogan’s white paper came out: Project Blue would not affect the Santa Cruz River, he said. It would use three sources of water, including from two locations where treated wastewater is currently stored underground for future use, as well as the Tucson airport remediation plant, which treats contaminated groundwater that currently stays on site. And it gave an estimate of water use: over 1,900 acre-feet, or 620m gallons, enough to supply more than four typical 18-hole Pima county golf courses, according to Thomure. Beale also pledged to invest $100m in a pipeline to transport and use treated wastewater, and create 180 jobs. But this is not “water positive”, and it would rather cause “net depletion of our groundwater resources to supply Project Blue”, said Bogan, the aquatic ecologist. He pointed to a city document which notes that if Project Blue were to use more groundwater than it could replenish, it could make payments, or “water positivity rates” to make up for it. Lisa Shipek, executive director of southern Arizona’s Watershed Management Group , agreed with Bogan’s assessment. By possibly paying for using up groundwater, Project Blue, Shipek said, would potentially “replace wet water with ‘paper water’”. The tactic – paying for consuming wet water, or offsetting it in another way, whether in the form of water conservation or education measures – has been used to deplete groundwater throughout the world. Water not the only concern Water wasn’t community members’ only concern. Beale Infrastructure is not a typical developer, but rather a subsidiary of the asset management company Blue Owl. On 21 July, the local news site Arizona Luminaria published a story revealing that Pima county staff possessed a memo stating that Project Blue would be financed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The story prompted fresh outcry from community members frustrated with Amazon’s anti-union actions , and overtures by its owner, Jeff Bezos, to the Trump administration. An AWS spokesperson said: “AWS has previously engaged in standard due diligence processes in Arizona, like we do in any geographic location we consider building and operating our infrastructure. We do not have any commitments or agreements in place to develop this project.” But the company declined to answer a question about whether AWS was affiliated with Project Blue in the past, or, potentially, in the future. A Beale spokesperson said: “We cannot comment on our tenants until a more advanced stage of the project.” Another wrinkle that added to the uproar was a news release from Tucson Electric Power (TEP) put out hours after the county vote on 17 June, announcing it was requesting a 14% rate increase to offset grid investments and inflation. With datacenters driving up electricity demand across the country, many community members assumed the rate hike was related to Project Blue, said the county supervisor, Matt Heinz. It wasn’t. The timing was coincidental, and a huge mistake, he said. “It’s unfortunately really plagued this whole project.” A TEP spokesperson, Joseph Barrios, said that the rate increase had nothing to do with Project Blue, but was based on costs already incurred in 2024 and before. A banner held up at the convention center. Photograph: Wild Horizon/Universal/Getty Images “We understand that any rate increase could have an impact on our customers and it’s not something we take lightly,” he said. Outrage over Project Blue grew rapidly over the summer. Eliseo Gomez, a local high school teacher and organizer, convened with a small group at the base of Tucson’s “A” mountain shortly after the 17 June vote. “We were like: what can we do?” They decided to target the annexation vote. The group started a website and social media channels named No Desert Data Center , encouraging people to express their concerns with the mayor and city council. In response, the city arranged for two public meetings with presentations from Beale Infrastructure, as well as Tucson Water and TEP. The majority of attenders at both meetings were clearly opposed, most wearing red shirts saying “no to Project Blue” or holding protest signs. Union members, enticed by promises of construction jobs, made up a supportive minority at the events. Attenders grew increasingly upset, Gomez said, as they felt their concerns and queries were dodged or ignored. By the second meeting, on 4 August, many locals appeared fed up. Beale executives gave similar speeches, without providing much further detail, incensing the crowd, whose boos and shouts made it difficult for presenters to continue. Many citizens presented their own research. “I feel like I learned more about Project Blue from the public than the city,” said city councilman Rocque Perez. On 6 August, in an unscheduled vote, council members unanimously decided to discontinue discussions with Beale, each sharing short speeches revealing sharp opposition to Project Blue. Tucsonans packing the council chambers cheered and celebrated; Beale executives, appearing stunned, were booed as they left. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Impact on Tucson politics Still, Beale hasn’t given up. In mid-September, the company proposed moving forward with an air-cooled system that uses less water than the original design. Beale co-filed a state application with the TEP, to be supplied with up to 286 megawatts – enough to power to up to 250,000 homes. In a statement, Beale has described the new design as a closed-loop system that “uses minimal amounts of water that are continuously recirculated, thereby eliminating water loss”. Several local leaders said the Republican-led Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees electricity use in the state, is likely to approve the project’s electricity request. That would mean Beale’s main remaining hurdle is finding a water source. The company has not said how it would obtain any such water, however, and given the city council’s vote, they cannot be supplied by the city’s public utility. Meanwhile, the controversy has had a profound impact on Tucson politics. Even supporters acknowledge the Project Blue process started poorly, partly because non-disclosure agreements between Beale and city staff dating back to 2022 meant that most elected leaders knew little to nothing about it until some time this year. Supervisor Jennifer Allen said the first meeting between Beale and the board in late May was short on details, including water use, and her requests for more information turned up nothing concrete. It was “a lot of greenwashing”, she said. She voted no on 17 June, as did her colleague Andrés Cano. Heinz, a longtime Democrat, said he voted for the rezoning and sale because the project had long been championed by city staff, including city manager Thomure, and because the tens of thousands of hi-tech jobs in the area will need access to nearby datacenters. Though there weren’t detailed water use estimates at first, Heinz said he wasn’t worried as Beale would be working with Tucson Water and the city would be “putting in those guardrails”. The north-eastern edge of the Tucson Mountains. . Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty Images The new design, he said, “will be an even better fit for southern Arizona”. “I frankly wish they’d approached us with this air-cooled design to begin with.” Heinz, as well as supervisors Rex Scott and Steve Christy, have come under withering scrutiny from constituents, who have implored the board to revisit the sale agreement. Heinz said that wasn’t going to happen. “There’s no vote before the board,” Heinz said. “It’s done. And I don’t want to reverse it.” Scott acknowledged that NDAs played a negative role in the affair and noted that both the county and city had already implemented new guidelines for handling them, which should grant more transparency to the process, Scott said. The city council has also since passed new rules to give more transparency and oversight over big water users, and they are developing specific guidelines and guard-rails to govern any future proposed data centers. ‘Cities across the country are being sold the same story’ While Beale’s air-cooled system may use less water, it has highlighted the other enormous costs of datacenters: electricity. Air-cooled systems use huge amounts of energy and are less energy efficient – especially in a desert where the daily average high is 29C (84F). It’s now a national issue – a 2024 report to Congress co-authored by Oak Ridge National Laboratory researcher AB Siddik estimates that datacenters consumed 4.4% of the nation’s total electricity as of 2023, which could rise to as much as 12% by 2028. TEP’s involvement has brought scrutiny to the private utility; locals have recently been protesting at their headquarters. On 23 September, the mayor and council announced they plan to intervene in the utility’s request to the state for the rate hike, saying in a statement such an increase “will strain families and small businesses and slow the transition to clean, affordable energy”. Community members hold up signs at the Tucson convention center. Photograph: Wild Horizons/Universal/Getty Images The saga has also raised the possibility that the Tucsonans or their leaders could consider pursuing a public utility to replace TEP when its contract is due for review in 2025, though that could be an enormous effort, Perez said. “I’m disappointed that Tucson Electric Power is partnering with Beale despite strong community concerns,” said councilman Kevin Dahl. “It certainly makes an argument for public power.” TEP spokesperson Joseph Barrios said that the utility’s involvement with Project Blue would not raise customers’ rates or affect their service. “We have an obligation to serve, and that includes all customers within our service area,” Barrios said. As far as the possibility of public power, “we feel our community is better served by continuing to work together”, he added. Council member and vice-mayor Lane Santa Cruz said this wasn’t just about Tucson, though. “What’s happening here isn’t unique to us: cities across the country are being sold the same story, with promises of jobs, innovation and progress,” she said. “But what’s not being talked about is who really benefits and what it costs us.” Too often, she added, these projects are extractive, using a community’s water, electricity, and labor – while providing only a small number of jobs – instead of being a sustainable partner. “We need to be the city that draws the line,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/tucson-arizona-ai-data-center-project-blue,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b7f391d3339a8b4cf874a8c4ac9f8f59fe53884/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3cf548355a4730ba03ba73aa625121dc",2025-10-15T14:00:41+00:00,53631ec7a99fbe57e4868ec29d553eff5078349c
6c68f6bd94b6,DNA from discarded straw leads to indictment of murder suspect after 41 years,,"Four decades after prosecutors sent the wrong men to prison for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl from Long Island, New York , DNA obtained from a discarded straw has led to the indictment of a new suspect. A Nassau county grand jury on Tuesday indicted Richard Bilodeau, 63, of Center Moriches, on two counts of murder in the death of 16-year-old Theresa Fusco, who disappeared after leaving her part-time job at a Lynbrook roller-skating rink in November 1984. Her nude body was found weeks after the assault, buried under leaves in a wooded area near the rink. Three men were convicted of the killing and served several years in prison before they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2003. They sued for wrongful imprisonment, and two were each awarded $18m. Bilodeau pleaded not guilty to the charges on Wednesday and was remanded to the county jail. His lawyer, Jason Russo, declined comment, saying he had just met Bilodeau shortly before the court hearing. Bilodeau was 23 and living with his grandparents when Fusco was killed, prosecutors said. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison. County authorities started watching Bilodeau last year after developing what they said were “multiple investigative leads”. In February 2024, investigators recovered a cup and straw they said Bilodeau had used and discarded at a smoothie cafe in neighboring Suffolk county. DNA extracted from the straw matched a sample taken from Fusco’s body in 1984. “The past has not been forgotten,” Anne Donnelly, Nassau district attorney, said during a news conference. The “indictment stands as proof that no matter how much time passes, we will never stop fighting for victims. My office is determined to see justice for Theresa and her family.” During the arraignment, assistant district attorney Jared Rosenblatt said that when investigators matched the DNA with Bilodeau, they went to his workplace to speak with him. Rosenblatt said that Bilodeau told investigators: “Yeah, people got away with murder back then.” “Well, Mr Bilodeau, it’s 2025, and your day of reckoning is now,” Rosenblatt said. Fusco’s killing drew wide attention at the time, partly because she disappeared around the same time and area as two other teenage girls, one of whom was a friend of Fusco.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/dna-murder-case-long-island,Science,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/866fe6c692828f8a7322979db51d9b9d7273d41e/597_0_2375_1901/master/2375.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50dbb9642be800ec4a89c2677ca2358e",2025-10-15T19:00:20+00:00,a936978745e38be6feebd8f32663f4bba2c87085
3e33b5f703a2,Harry Kane out to avenge World Cup heartache after ‘worst moment’ in Qatar,,"Harry Kane has said that his penalty heartbreak against France at the last World Cup has changed him as a player and given him extra motivation to lead England to glory at the tournament next summer . The captain missed from the spot in the 84th minute of the quarter‑final in Qatar in 2022 as England slipped to a 2-1 defeat – a moment Kane describes as the lowest of his career, worse than losing any club final. The Bayern Munich striker lost three of them with his previous club, Tottenham, including the Champions League final in 2019. Kane’s response to the failure against France was to work at introducing greater variation to his penalty-taking technique, principally a stutter run where he waits for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball. The results have been spectacular. Kane went on a run of 31 successful conversions for club and country after France, the sequence broken at the start of this season when he missed for Bayern in the German Cup against Wehen Wiesbaden. Since then, he has scored six in a row, the latest coming in England’s 5-0 win against Latvia in Riga on Tuesday. The result secured qualification for the World Cup finals, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. “I always try to learn from those moments,” Kane said. “After that penalty, I went 31 without missing. I changed my technique a little bit. I improved in that sense, which I was proud of. In terms of that being my last memory of a World Cup … yeah, I’m looking forward to the next World Cup to try to put that right, to try to go further, to try to lift the trophy as we all dream of doing. Those moments only shape you as a person, as a player and it’s definitely helped me to become a better player.” It was striking to hear Kane open up about the miss against France. “I’d say that was probably the worst that I felt in any moment,” he said. “Obviously I’ve lost finals before. To have that responsibility, you almost feel like it fell on my shoulders and I guess not being able to execute something that I’ve been able to execute many a time in my career … I think that was the hardest part to process and take. “Always as a sportsman, putting yourself in that situation … there’s going to be moments where it doesn’t quite go your way. But [it’s] the way I learned from that … the way that motivated me to get even better and improve – not just from the penalty side in terms of improving my technique but as an all-round player. To know I want to be back there at the World Cup, to help England get back there.” Kane scored twice in the victory against Latvia to move to 76 England goals. If Wayne Rooney’s previous record for the nation of 53 is fast becoming a speck in the rearview mirror, the prospect of Kane reaching an astonishing century feels increasingly feasible. Kane is overcome with disappointment after missing from 12 yards against France in Qatar. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian “I think it’s there,” the 32‑year‑old captain said. “The way I’m feeling right now, I’m not slowing down any time soon. I want to stay at this level for as long as I can. I’m on 76 now so that leaves 24 and we have a few more games between now and the World Cup … and then try to edge closer to that 100.” Kane has scored 18 goals for Bayern this season plus three for England. He feels he is in the form of his life. “I think so. The goals are there and the numbers speak for themselves. The way I feel on the pitch, the way I am seeing the game, physically and without the ball, pressing … I feel in a really good place. I feel like I have stepped up another level this season.” The England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, who signed Kane at Bayern in the summer of 2023, paid tribute to his professionalism. “For me, he never misses a penalty,” Tuchel said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

622394afcee3,"Sumo stars balance power, intricacy and spectacle at London showcase",,"A t 6pm exactly, the first, and only, professional sumo dohyo anywhere outside Japan was finally ready. It had taken four days to build. The clay, shipped up from Kettering, where, the experts said, the earth had just the right consistency, had been shaped, sculpted, pounded into a stage, the six-tonne wooden canopy had been joined, and hung from the roof, the rice-straw bales had been beaten into shape with empty beer bottles, brought over especially for the purpose, and laid in a circle around the ring, the arena had been blessed by three priests, doused with saki, and strewn with salt. Outside, an eager crowd was gathering underneath the streaming banners. There were corporate sorts, charging their bar bills to company expenses, a troop of diplomats, going to glad hand the Japanese ambassador at a VIP reception, and an awful lot of sumo super fans, some of them big men with beards, who first fell in love with the sport when it was on Channel 4 in the early 90s, some of them slight young women head-to-toe in Comme des Garçons , some middle-aged salarymen holding banners decorated with pictures of their favourite rikishi . Every one delighted, every one very excited. This being London, a handful of shifty men circulated among them, whispering in thick cockney accents: “Tickets, tickets, buy or sell, who’s got tickets?” The price, if you’re asking, was “five hundred quid each for the good seats”. The crowd was entranced by the displays of hoisting and dumping. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian It’s the first time an official sumo tournament has been held outside Japan in 34 years, since it was last staged here at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991. “This is not only a sporting event, but a sacred ceremony,” said the Japanese Sumo Association chair, Hakkaku, in his welcome address. Something like Test cricket for the English, then. A lot of the fun is in the little details of the rituals, the crowd coo for the wrestlers who can lift their legs highest for the ritual foot stomping, and cackle for the ones who make a great show of tossing their salt furthest across the ring. The last time Hakkaku spoke in the Albert Hall, it was to thank the crowd for their support after he won that first tournament. He’s been chair since 2015, and is due to retire in three years. It was a personal project of his to bring the sport back to the place where he won his famous victory before he retired from office. It’s already a success. Sumo is Japan’s national sport, and this is an exercise in soft diplomacy. There are, you guess, a few new business deals being toasted up in the corporate boxes. The Hall is sold out for the week. If the prices were steep, they were still pretty cheap compared to stumping up for a flight to Tokyo to watch at the sport’s spiritual home, the Ryogoku Kokugikan. Plenty of people here are seeing it live for the very first time after years of following it online. “It’s my first time seeing a professional fight,” says Richard Riggs, vice-president of the British Sumo Association. “I couldn’t be more excited for it.” A fan holds up a banner in support of Wakatakakage before the event at the Royal Albert Hall. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Riggs is a (large) member of the (small) band of British sumo wrestlers. He used to play rugby, but took the sport up during lockdown when he was looking for something new to do. Two and a half years later he was competing for the British national team at the amateur world championships. He just set up his own sumo club in Barnsley. “We like to say the sport is an inch wide, but a mile deep,” says his friend, the BSA secretary, George Young. They get irritated by stereotypes. Sumo is an incredibly intricate sport, and the techniques take years to master. There are 82 ways to win a single bout. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The tempo goes slow-slow then very quick, as the wrestlers settle then snap into action. It all happens so quickly that it’s almost impossible to tell exactly what combination of holds and twists the winner used, and the night’s opening fights end in split seconds. It’s made spectator-friendly by the ringside work of Hiro Morita, who hosts the JSA’s YouTube show, Sumo Primetime. Morita’s commentary is being piped in on earpieces, and in between the clacks of the wooden hyoshigi blocks used to summon the wrestlers, and in the bass rumble and thump of all that flesh being heaved about the ring, the hall crackles with the sound of his gleeful observations. The crowd adore Shishi, one of two Ukrainian wrestlers competing here this week. The JSA is worried about the waning numbers of sumo wrestlers, they used to have 1,000, but now they are down to just 600, which is another reason why they have decided to spread the net by bringing this tournament overseas. Hakkaku hopes that Shishi’s performances here will help inspire more European wrestlers to join up, that, somewhere out there in the hall, there will be some young sumo fan, dreaming of making a life for himself out there under the bright lights of the dohyo .",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/sumo-stars-balance-power-intricacy-and-spectacle-at-london-showcase,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3953d8072649da65c36447fd715d67bc3680c53/1000_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=511ec4584749c7c7624aae5b8dba493b",2025-10-15T21:48:41+00:00,67d6cbfbd67aba5b6b003631102e4a4d60721fe3
9781d6769b6a,England captain Zoe Aldcroft on winning World Cup: ‘We had so much belief’,,"“I was telling myself: ‘Don’t cry right now, Zoe. Do not cry right now.’ But I just knew that we’d done it.” Zoe Aldcroft is reflecting on the moment last month when she realised England had won the Women’s Rugby World Cup. There were 12 minutes to play at a sold-out, increasingly euphoric Twickenham, but the hosts had created a 20-point cushion against Canada thanks to Alex Matthews’s second try. Aldcroft was correct: the game was settled at 33-13 . A lifelong dream for her – and all the Red Roses – was about to become reality. “I ran back to the line and I was like: ‘Oh my God, we’ve done it.’ I saw my family and they were like [she clenches both fists]: ‘Come on, come on!’ Another moment was when Ellie Kildunne put that spiral bomb up [before the final try]. I thought: ‘We’ve got this in the palm of our hands.’ And the final whistle. We’ll never forget that moment.” Aldcroft describes the weeks since as a “massive whirlwind”. Pressed to choose one word to describe the entire experience, she settles on “phenomenal”. It’s back down to business now: the Premiership Women’s Rugby season begins next Friday and the flanker has returned to training this week with the champions, Gloucester-Hartpury. After a run of three consecutive titles, they will kick off against Saracens at Kingsholm on Sunday week. Hopefully she had time for a holiday first? “I had a few days away with my husband, Luke, then to Ibiza with a few of the Red Roses,” Aldcroft says. “That was unbelievable, it was great. We went to Pacha and it was really fun.” Aldcroft (second right), and her England teammate Alex Matthews (right), train with Winscombe Warriors at the home of Melksham RFC in Wiltshire. Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA The break was well earned. As captain of the overwhelming favourites, the 28-year-old shouldered a remarkable amount of pressure, particularly after England’s heartbreak at previous World Cups. Reminded of the crucial second-half try against France in England’s semi-final , when they led 7-5, Aldcroft describes the calmness under pressure that made the difference. “I think one of our greatest strengths as Red Roses is we are so calm in those moments,” Aldcroft says. “I remember half-time [in the semi-final] being literally a couple of instructions and we were like: ‘All right, there we go then.’ Even when Canada scored first in the final there was no emotion to it. We’ve got so much belief.” What did she take from the tournament? “I learned every single day about who I am, the leader I am, the leader I want to be,” Aldcroft says. “The biggest thing I’ve taken is going off feel: instinct is probably my biggest strength. “Trying to get a sense of what everyone’s feeling, how they’re motivated, if they need to be left alone or brought together. And leading into the final, how people dealt with that: everyone is so different. You need to work out how they want to be. Everyone in that week just switched it on and we were ready to go.” England’s men’s World Cup winners of 2003 have described their struggles in returning quickly to club duty, and Aldcroft admits it has not been entirely straightforward. “Sunday came and it was: ‘Right, got to switch back to club.’ “I had a couple of calls with Murph [the new Gloucester‑Hartpury coach Dan Murphy] last week. He was going over what was new and I was like: ‘I do not want to be listening to this right now.’ But for me to be part of this journey going into the season is important. skip past newsletter promotion The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After that final I felt really free. That was an incredible feeling.

Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty Images It may seem that with the World Cup secured and three consecutive PWR titles under Gloucester-Hartpury’s belt, there are no worlds left to conquer. Beyond winning more silverware Aldcroft describes the more subtle factors now driving her. “This only came to me yesterday, but I think a big motivation for me now is bringing that next generation up. We’ve got a lot of new girls that have come through the pathway at Gloucester-Hartpury. “I want to lead them through my actions, give them my knowledge, to help them come up through their own journey. And also finding things I want to improve: whether that be mindset, experiences, skills on the pitch. But yeah, that was my biggest one: bringing up that next group of players to join the Red Roses.” A World Cup win is a life‑changing experience for any athlete, and Aldcroft confirms her agent has been busy. “There are a lot of things coming in. It’s important to take those opportunities, to put ourselves out there and expand women’s rugby. Personally I’m quite a content person so I’ll take it as it comes. I’m happy to do things if they come and not if they don’t.

370f81ce08c9,Alyssa Thompson adds sparkle to Chelsea’s WCL cruise against Paris FC,,"Chelsea kickstarted their European campaign with a comfortable victory over Paris FC . Alyssa Thompson scored her first goal in west London as Sonia Bompastor’s side dominated proceedings. Sandy Baltimore opened the scoring from the penalty spot while Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert also got on the scoresheet. Chelsea had endured a frustrating start to their Champions League challenge, the only trophy to elude their grasp. A 1-1 draw against Twente last week in Enschede had added a bit of pressure on this encounter at Stamford Bridge with sterner opposition to come. There was no reason for Chelsea not to be full of confidence ahead of this encounter. They had returned to winning ways against Tottenham at the weekend and remain unbeaten in all competitions. There has, however, been a trend of wasted opportunities that has been causing some consternation. The lack of attacking cohesion has not been helped by Bompastor’s tinkering of personnel and systems. There were just two changes from the weekend with Baltimore returning from a knock and Sjoeke Nüsken replacing the missing Ellie Carpenter. Paris FC had suffered an equally irritating opening to their league phase, surrendering a 2-0 lead to the newcomers OH Leuven. Sandrine Soubeyrand welcomed back the goalkeeper Mylène Chavas after a spell out with concussion while Maëlle Garbino and Anaële Le Moguédec came into the starting lineup. It promised to be an intriguing matchup between two managers who are very well acquainted. Bompastor and Soubeyrand played for France together for over a decade while also meeting many times as managers in the Première Ligue. Chelsea dominated proceedings from the start, having more of the ball and creating more chances than their opponents. The urgency to score early was clear and led to a series of snatched opportunities where patience was needed. Nüsken and Cuthbert had efforts from distance while Aggie Beever-Jones scuffed two gilt-edged opportunities. Erin Cuthbert toes in Chelsea’s fourth in the second half. Photograph: John Walton/PA The hosts’ pressure eventually told, however, when Nüsken went down in the box with half an hour played. The offence from Le Moguédec was not initially spotted by the referee, Michalina Diakow, but after a brief trip to the VAR monitor, she duly pointed to the spot. Baltimore stepped up to convert for the second week in a row. Chelsea consolidated their advantage just before the break when Thompson, whose speed had been causing problems all half, broke forward. A clever turn saw her find space to stand up a cross for Rytting Kaneryd to loop a header home. The winger looked slightly bemused that it had ended up in the back of the net, celebrating with an expression that said she is not particularly used to scoring with her head. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After thrashing Bayern Munich 7-1 in their opener, Barça broke through after just two minutes in the Italian capital, Esmee Brugts scrambling the ball in from close range. Barcelona won a penalty early in the second half, only for Putellas to send her attempted Panenka over the bar. Just before the hour, Kika Nazareth volleyed into the far corner to double the visitors' lead, and Putellas made amends with her second spot-kick. Caroline Graham Hansen's late tap-in completed the rout. Twente could not follow up last week's draw with Chelsea as they lost 2-1 at OH Leuven despite taking a first-half lead through Jaimy Ravensbergen. The Dutch side held on until the 82nd minute before conceding a penalty, converted by Linde Veefkind. In the sixth minute of stoppage time, Sara Pusztai struck a spectacular winner for Leuven, smashing the ball into the top corner. Earlier, a much-changed OL Lyonnes side eased to a 3-0 home win over St Pölten. Jule Brand opened the scoring with her first goal for the club, and Ada Hegerberg headed the hosts' second just before half-time as the Austrian visitors paid for missed chances. Teenage midfielder Lily Yohannes completed the scoring soon after the restart with a brilliant lob from close to the halfway line. Wolfsburg grabbed a late victory at Vålerenga thanks to Janina Minge's penalty. The midfielder converted from the spot with the last kick of the game after Naina Inauen's foul in the area. Wolfsburg took the lead through Lineth Beerensteyn in the 57th minute, but Sara Hørte headed home just three minutes later to level for the hosts in Oslo. Guardian sport Photograph: Matteo Ciambelli/REUTERS Chelsea did not let their foot off the gas and extended their lead immediately after the break. A well-worked move saw Keira Walsh cut a low ball across the box for Thompson to turn home. It was a first goal for the 20-year-old American in her new home, having arrived as the headline signing from Angel City this summer. They added a fourth after a series of substitutions injected yet more energy into the game. Sam Kerr thought she had claimed her first Champions League goal since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament injury only for it to be awarded to Cuthbert who somewhat inadvertently got a touch on the line. As the game drew to a close, there was still time for the Cobham academy product and England youth international Lexi Potter to make her debut. It was a much-needed comfortable victory for Chelsea and an important three points on the board.

2f5eac66b2be,Rain saves England at Women’s World Cup and ruins Pakistan hopes of historic win,,"Pakistan came agonisingly close to their first one-day international win against England in Colombo on Wednesday, reaching 34 without loss in pursuit of a DLS-adjusted target of 113 before torrential downpours curtailed their hopes of making history. England’s batting has lurched from one disaster to another ­during this World Cup – they had to be bailed out by Heather Knight against Bangladesh and by Nat Sciver-Brunt against Sri Lanka – and here it looked like their frailties would return to haunt them, as they collapsed to 79 for seven in the opening 25 overs. After an initial rain delay of almost four hours, England returned to add 54 further runs – but Pakistan’s ­openers Muneeba Ali and Omaima Sohail looked to be making short work of the chase, assisted by the absence of England’s key strike ­bowlers Lauren Bell and Sophie Ecclestone through illness. Only further rain saved England’s blushes. “Pakistan bowled brilliantly and made it really hard for us to get into the game at all,” the England captain, Sciver-Brunt, told Sky Sports. “We weren’t good enough and we’ll hold our hands up. Everyone’s practising really well and I guess it’s about finding a way to do that in games.” The no-result means that England remain on course to progress to the semi-finals if they win one of their final three group-stage games against India, Australia and New Zealand. This tournament has so far been a spinner’s paradise, but here it was prodigious swing that caused the England top-order problems, after massive rainfall 24 hours earlier which washed out the second half of Sri Lanka’s match against New Zealand. Pakistan’s young captain, Fatima Sana, sent down a remarkable spell of 5-1-19-3, including a wicket maiden first up, bowling Amy Jones through the gate with an inswinger. Knight once again saved herself with a timely DRS review against Sana which was missing leg stump, only for the Pakistan captain to strike twice in the next over with two further hooping deliveries – one which Sciver-Brunt chopped on to her stumps, and a second which struck Knight plumb in front. Earlier, Tammy Beaumont had shouldered arms to Diana Baig and was bowled by a nip-backer which clipped the top of her off-stump, while it was the left-arm spin of Sadia Iqbal which did for Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lumb. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

0ab3fc880f39,Could Trump really move World Cup games? The facts behind his threats,,"What exactly did Trump say? Which time? Tuesday was the second time Trump has threatened to take away World Cup games from US host cities on the basis of their political leadership or opposition to his policies. However, it’s important to note that this suggestion of moving games is not something Trump has suggested organically, of his own volition. In both cases, the US president was responding to leading questions centered around the idea of moving games. On 25 September in an Oval Office event, a member of the White House press corps asked Trump about cities that have demonstrated against Trump’s use of federal agencies for immigration and crime crackdowns. The reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco as two cities that have seen demonstrations, and pointed out that both cities are World Cup hosts (though San Francisco is not a host city, but part of the San Francisco Bay Area that will host games at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara). The reporter then asked Trump if the demonstrations could result in the loss of World Cup games from those host venues. “I guess, but we’re going to make sure they’re safe,” Trump said . “They’re run by radical left lunatics and that don’t know what they’re doing.” Later Trump said that Chicago would be safe for the World Cup after he sends in federal agencies in a similar manner as Washington DC. Chicago is not a 2026 World Cup host city. “If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won’t allow it to go to it. We’ll move it around a little bit,” Trump said. Three weeks later, on 14 October, Trump was asked about another host city, Boston, even though the games themselves will be held in suburban Foxborough, Massachusetts. Towards the end of that day’s press event, a reporter asked Trump about a recent “street takeover” in Boston that saw police officers attacked and a police car set aflame, and if the concerns raised by the incident could result in the revocation of hosting duties for next year’s expanded 48-team soccer tournament. The reporter also asked if Trump would work with Michelle Wu, the Democratic mayor of Boston, to address the issue. “We could take them away,” Trump said of the World Cup games. “Their mayor is not good … She’s radical left, and they’re taking over parts of Boston. That’s a pretty big statement, right?” Street takeovers, a social media-driven phenomenon that sees large crowds of people gather on city streets late at night to perform stunts in cars, have been a repeated nuisance in American cities since the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns. Recent such gatherings have turned violent in Massachusetts, including in Boston. However, the gatherings are generally not seen as being tied to any particular political ideology, nor have they been touted as a large-scale safety concern for World Cup attendees. “If someone is doing a bad job, and I feel there’s unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni [Infantino], the head of Fifa, who is phenomenal, and say let’s move it to another location,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And he would do that. He wouldn’t love to do it, but he’d do it. Very easily, he’d do it.” Later in that same event, Trump for the first time broached the possibility of moving the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles as well. “If I thought LA was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to,” he said. “On that one I’d probably have to get a different kind of a permission, but we would do that.” Does the US president have any power over the World Cup or Olympics? In short: No. At least not unilaterally. In the World Cup’s case, the host city agreements are signed between Fifa, soccer’s global governing body, and the local municipalities. Though the deal involves a public government, it is essentially a private business deal, and the US president does not have authority to cancel it on his own. That said, Trump can apply pressure to the various parties to back out of the deal if he is truly committed to removing games from the cities in question. That could include withholding federal funding from the cities as he has for various other aspects of American life. It could also include an appeal to Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who has carefully cultivated a close relationship with Trump since the US president’s return to office. Could Fifa actually move World Cup games from places like Boston or Seattle? Theoretically, yes. We can say this with relative surety thanks to Seattle, which released the host city agreement it signed with Fifa. Within that agreement there is a clause (4.5, to be exact) that addresses the possible revocation of host city selection. The clause essentially states that by agreeing to be a World Cup host city, Seattle also agrees to do a number of different (and often expensive) things to increase public safety, including the deployment of additional security measures and transportation methods, plus the assumption of various financial liabilities. Fifa could in theory point to that clause as reasoning for revoking Seattle’s status as a World Cup host city if it feels like safety standards are woefully behind. It’s hard to imagine it being all that likely, though. Any World Cup is a gigantic logistical affair, let alone one spread across three countries and 16 host cities featuring more teams than ever before. It’s hard enough for Fifa to create the match schedule and oversee teams’ travel. Introducing a reduction in venues, or a change in venues, or multiple of them, would be a gargantuan undertaking so close to the actual event. It’s easy to assume it would be the subject of legal action on behalf of the host city as well. What role does the US government actually play in these events? So far, it has been mostly promotional and/or threatening in nature. Trump convened a World Cup task force earlier this year headed by Andrew Giuliani, with a stated mission of “facilitat[ing] comprehensive planning, organization, and execution of the largest sporting events in the history of mankind.” The federal government also has a role in approving visas for visitors from other countries, but processing times for those have ballooned to such a level that many fear that they won’t have visas approved in time for the games themselves. There is also the public safety aspect. One can presume that FBI agents and potentially those from Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will be dispatched to World Cup host cities with the stated intention of providing an additional layer of security on top of local police. Boston mayor Michelle Wu has dismissed Trump’s threat of removing World Cup games from Foxborough. Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images How has Fifa responded? So far, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said nothing publicly about Trump’s threat. He did, however, find time to travel to Egypt to be alongside Trump at the Gaza summit – a curious move for someone whose role in the world is nominally about sports. Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, a Canadian, was far more direct speaking at a London conference in early October, responding to Trump’s comments about Seattle and San Francisco. “It’s Fifa’s tournament, Fifa’s jurisdiction, Fifa makes those decisions,” Montagliani said. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans. That’s the beauty of our game, that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.” A Fifa spokesperson told Politico “Safety and security are of the utmost importance at all FIFA events worldwide and it is ultimately the government’s responsibility to decide what’s in the best interest of public safety. We hope every one of our 16 host cities will be ready to fulfill all necessary requirements for a successful 2026 World Cup.” Outside of Fifa, Wu responded to Trump’s threat by pointing out that much of Fifa’s host city agreements are “locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it. “We’re in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda.” Have events ever been moved before? Only in cases of extreme and/or unexpected health and safety concerns, war, or other political disturbance. The 2003 Women’s World Cup was the last senior-level tournament with that name to be moved – it was originally due to be held in China but was shifted to the US due to that year’s Sars outbreak. Fifa also pulled the 2023 Under-20 World Cup from Indonesia after several members of that country’s government and large sections of the populace opposed the inclusion of Israel in the tournament. Indonesia does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has broadly supported Palestine. Indonesia later hosted that year’s U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting. The Olympics have been canceled due to wars or postponed a year in the case of Covid-19 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but they have not changed host cities since 1908, when the eruption of Mount Vesuvius forced the Rome games to decamp to London. Why is Trump tying “safety” to these events? Likely because he has made that topic a feature of his administration. It is the guise under which he has deployed the national guard, Ice, and other federal agencies to Washington DC, Chicago and other cities. The fact that safety is a genuine and justified concern at any major gathering of people – especially one as vast as the World Cup – makes it an easy line to fall back on for his administration. What would happen if Washington tried to intervene? That’ll be the real test, won’t it? When Washington has intervened in many other aspects of American life, the targeted institutions have often complied or tried to negotiate. It remains to be seen if Fifa or the IOC will take that path – if indeed Trump decides to pursue this at all.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/trump-world-cup-threats-explained,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e899cc9c4afaae340457551d02d9936e18d8cd9d/157_0_2959_2368/master/2959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6235d366be0dda63ee7908bd105993ac",2025-10-15T18:01:48+00:00,ef6d95b0a53c511b6abfc9aa3a6aa62d6952048a
937d77ce9609,Rangers push to seal Kevin Muscat deal after Danny Röhl withdraws from race,,"Rangers face increased pressure to complete a deal for Kevin Muscat to become their new manager after another leading candidate, Danny Röhl, made it known he has withdrawn from the process. Röhl, who left Sheffield Wednesday in the summer, becomes the second coach after Steven Gerrard to remove his name from consideration following detailed talks with the Rangers board. The messiness of this situation is unlikely to placate an already angry fanbase. There was, however, an increased confidence from Rangers sources on Wednesday that Muscat could be delivered. Russell Martin was sacked as the Rangers manager last Sunday, his spell lasting just 123 days amid constant negativity from supporters. The Ibrox hierarchy only turned attention towards Muscat, who spent a brief time as a Rangers player, earlier this week. Yet appointing the Australian will not be completely straightforward; he is under contract with Shanghai Port for another year, with the club leading the Chinese Super League title race with four games to go. Shanghai Port’s season will not end until 22 November, before which time Rangers have eight games at home and abroad. Muscat would almost certainly have to take a pay cut to move to Glasgow. He is, though, known to be keen on managing in Britain after prior spells at Melbourne Victory, Belgium’s Sint-Truiden and Yokohama F. Marinos. The 52-year-old has maintained an affiliation with Rangers despite leaving in 2003. Danny Röhl has joined Steven Gerrard in withdrawing from the process to find a new Rangers manager. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/Reuters There was awareness within Ibrox that Röhl, 36, was likely to meet with a lukewarm reception in the stands if appointed. This caused unease among Rangers’ decision-makers. The German’s only experience as a first-team manager came at Wednesday. Muscat is considerably more popular among Rangers fans, partly because of a prior connection to the club but also because of his supposed no-nonsense approach to management. Muscat was previously in the running for the Rangers post in 2023, when Philippe Clement was instead appointed. Rangers are expected to at least clarify their short-term management plans by Friday. Dundee United visit Ibrox on Scottish Premiership business on Saturday afternoon. Rangers are eighth in the table and currently trail the leaders, Hearts, by 11 points.

2f12262b965d,Russell Westbrook signs one-year deal with Sacramento Kings for 18th NBA season,,"Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings, ESPN confirmed Wednesday through his agent Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports Management. The 2017 MVP joins the Kings ahead of his 18th NBA season, giving Sacramento an experienced option in a backcourt that lacked depth a year ago. Westbrook, who turns 37 in November, spent last season with the Denver Nuggets, averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists and 4.9 rebounds in 75 games while shooting 44.9% from the field. He remained unsigned through the summer as he weighed options before finalizing terms with the Kings this week. He’s expected to join the team later this week. The Kings ranked 28th in bench scoring and 29th in assists per game last season, areas where Westbrook’s playmaking and energy could make an immediate impact. Perry has emphasized building a team that plays with effort and urgency, traits that have defined Westbrook’s career. Westbrook is the NBA’s all-time leader in triple-doubles (203) and ranks eighth in assists. He enters the season 506 points shy of surpassing Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard in league history.

7d75681ba439,Milan Olympic hockey arena delays may leave NHL stars on untested ice,,"Forget about thin ice. For now, there’s no ice. With NHL players preparing to return to the Olympics for the first time in more than a decade, construction on the main hockey arena for the Milan-Cortina Games is going down to the wire. Local organizers confirmed to the Associated Press on Wednesday that the main test event for the 16,000-seat Santagiulia arena that was scheduled for December has been moved to a smaller arena – and that no new test event has been scheduled yet. The issue raises the prospect that there might not be a game held in the main arena until the puck is dropped for the women’s preliminary round competition at the Olympics on 5 February – one day before the opening ceremony. “It’s going to be very close to the start of the games, the timeline is very tight. But we knew that,” Milan-Cortina local organizing committee CEO Andrea Varnier said recently. The event that was supposed to test the Santagiulia ice was part of the under-20 world championship from 8-14 December. That event has been moved to the Rho Fiera hockey venue, which is being set up inside a giant convention center on Milan’s outskirts and will host secondary matches during the games. Usually, new Olympic venues are tested at least the year before hosting medal events. And with a large hockey arena, it’s not just about the ice and making sure that the playing surface is ready and safe. It’s also about testing concession stands, bathrooms and everything else inside a brand-new modern arena. The Santagiulia venue, which is being built by a private company, is slated to become Italy’s largest indoor arena. For after the Olympics, it’s being eyed as a possible future host of the ATP Finals tennis event. Despite the delays and concerns, high-priced tickets are already being sold for events at the Santagiulia arena. Seats for the men’s gold medal game on 22 February – the closing day of the games – are going for as much as €1,400 (more than $1,600). That’s more than for any other sports event at the Milan-Cortina Games. Only tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies cost more. The return of NHL players at the Olympics was announced last February, with the world’s top hockey league allowing its players to participate in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014 in Sochi. The men’s Olympic hockey tournament is scheduled to run from 11-22 February.

d375a0bdf66a,From glorified sheds to sleek sci-fi palaces: how architecture put the zing into football grounds,,"B ill Shankly, a man so beloved by Liverpool that there is now a hotel in the city named after him, once famously observed: “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.” Inevitably, Shankly pops up in Home Ground, a punchy new exhibition on the architecture and social culture of football stadiums. The legendary manager is pictured savouring the acclaim of an adoring crowd, part of a tableau on the farewell to the Kop prior to its metamorphosis from churning tribal terrace into a more sedate, all-seater stand. In a bizarre optical illusion, when crowds surge down the corkscrew towers, they appear to be spiralling Marinaded in the romance and obsessiveness of the beautiful game, Liverpool is a serendipitous setting for a dive into the history and destiny of football grounds. Everton have just migrated to a super sleek new home , the 52,000 capacity Hill Dickinson Stadium on the Mersey waterfront, neatly encapsulating the distance football and its venues have travelled from rain-lashed terraces, flat caps and leaden balls, to a high-end, multi-sensory experience, with those who can afford it cosseted in private boxes and plied with fine dining, not unlike a visit to the opera. St James’ Park football stadium, Newcastle upon Tyne. Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA Collections Illustrated by a rich assortment of drawings, models, photographs and other ephemera, the exhibition’s chronological sweep opens with a 1906 plan of Anfield by Scottish architect Archibald Leitch . The towering terrace of 132 steps at the home end became known as the Kop, after the bloody hilltop battle of Spion Kop during the Boer war. Drawing on his early experience of designing factories and warehouses, Leitch went on to become the imperator of early football grounds. With daunting efficiency, he notched up more than 20 across the UK, including Stamford Bridge (Chelsea), Highbury (Arsenal) and Ibrox (Glasgow Rangers). Over a 29-year period he also designed Goodison Park, home of Liverpool’s great rivals Everton. Still used by its women’s team, it was the first ground in Britain to have seats and terracing on all four sides. England may have invented and formalised the game, but in the matter of stadium design, it was its European neighbours who really ran with the ball. In Florence, Fiorentina employed the renowned modernist Pier Luigi Nervi to devise a graceful exercise in reinforced concrete that brilliantly exploited the material’s potential to be shaped and sculpted. In Rotterdam, Feyenoord’s stadium of 1937 embodied the functionalist ideals of the Dutch Nieuwe Bouwen (New Building) movement, with a lightweight, skeletal steel frame used to suspend the upper tier above the lower, offering an unimpeded view of the pitch, revolutionary for its time. In a nice touch, the show’s thematic sections are denoted by custom designed football scarves in the zinging emerald green of grass under floodlights. In the part dedicated to Italia 90, graphic designer Alberto Burri ’s definitive World Cup poster features a football pitch in Rome’s Colosseum, the ur-stadium and theoretical point of origin for all modern football grounds. Italy went large on its hosting duties, spending billions upgrading existing stadiums and constructing new ones, including a sunken bowl in Bari by the Genoese hi-tech architect Renzo Piano with structural ribs resembling a whale’s carcass. Dominating proceedings like a giant wedding cake is a model of the San Siro in Milan . For Italia 90, an entirely new structure was built over the original 1926 stadium, incorporating red steel roof trusses supported by corkscrew-shaped circulation towers. Memorably, when crowds surge down the corkscrews, the towers appear to be spiralling, in a bizarre optical illusion. Though it remains the base of AC Milan and rivals Inter, after years of protracted wrangling, its days look to be numbered. Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany. Photograph: Herzog & de Meuron There are some surprising heirs to Archie Leitch. Though you might not think it, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are huge football aficionados with their firm producing some of the most radically inventive contemporary stadium designs. Fabricated from nearly 3,000 inflatable foil cushions impregnated with LED lighting, Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena can instantly change the colour of its skin, like a colossal, glowing chameleon. And in Braga, in northern Portugal, Eduardo Souto de Moura set a stadium in a disused limestone quarry, a natural amphitheatre where a wayward shot on goal will rebound off a cliff face. Gala Fairydean FC stadium on the Scottish Borders. Photograph: Architectural Press Archive / RIBA Collections “Spaceship” is an overused epithet, but football stadiums do have an otherworldly aura, as modern colossi looming above huddled neighbourhoods, evocative of Philip Larkin’s “ships up streets”. Yet size isn’t necessarily everything. In Galashiels in Scotland, Gala Fairydean’s bijoux stand for 750 supporters resembles a piece of concrete origami, designed by Peter Womersley in 1965. A pivotal moment was legislation for the development of all-seater grounds following the catastrophe of Hillsborough, its impact still resonating after nearly four decades. Before Hillsborough, 56 people died in the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire , in which the dilapidated main stand became an inferno within 270 seconds. Such disasters marked a hideous low point in British football history, showing how supporters were seen in a demeaning and dehumanised light by the authorities and how ageing structures had become rickety death traps. Unimaginably removed from the era of seething crowds on acres of terraces, the future of football stadiums lies in being increasingly sustainable and flexible. After the retractable roof comes the retractable pitch, as at Tottenham Hotspur’s new ground by arena design specialists Populus, which can accommodate everything from concerts to American football. Currently managed by former bad boy Robbie Savage, Forest Green Rovers may be minnows playing in the English league’s fifth tier, but have been described by Fifa as “the greenest team in the world”, demonstrating that a club can prioritise sustainability and still achieve success. Its proposal to build the world’s first all-timber stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will form the centrepiece of a new ecology park for the local community. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Photograph: (c) Populous The growth of the women’s game is also destined to shape the stadiums of the future. American club Kansas City Current are the first to play in a purpose-built venue for women’s professional soccer, incorporating subtle design changes such as modified seating and sight-lines, all calculated to appeal to a more family-oriented fanbase.

Wu appeared on local podcast “Java with Jimmy” on Wednesday to respond to Tuesday’s criticism from the White House, which labeled the Democrat as “radical left”. Trump threatened he would make a call to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino , if Boston did not “clean up its act”. “Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it,” Wu said. “We’re in a world where for drama, for control, for pushing the boundaries … ongoing threats … are issued to individuals and communities who refuse to back down and comply or be obedient to a hateful agenda. “We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston’s values,” Wu added. “Ten toes down for Boston .” Infantino appeared in photographs alongside Trump at the Gaza summit earlier this week.

Donald Trump and the Fifa leader, Gianni Infantino, at Monday’s Gaza summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

aa4fab2c4267,Tuchel will reach out to ‘important’ Bellingham before next England camp,,"Thomas Tuchel will reach out to Jude Bellingham and the other ­players he excluded from his latest England squad before he makes his next ­selection in November. The head coach’s decision to overlook Bellingham for the Wembley friendly against Wales last Thursday and the World Cup qualifier against ­Latvia in Riga on Tuesday has dominated the discourse . Tuchel wanted to show faith in the squad that won against Andorra and Serbia in September and it meant no room for those who missed out on the initial selection for fitness reasons. If Bellingham was the highest-profile absentee against Wales and Latvia, then Phil Foden was not far behind. Adam Wharton was also left out. Tuchel’s team defeated Wales 3-0 before winning 5-0 against ­Latvia to secure qualification for the finals next summer with a blemish-free record: six wins out of six with six clean sheets. He is keen to maintain the momentum in the final ­qualifiers against Serbia at Wembley and ­Albania in Tirana and will lean once more towards continuity; faith in those who have delivered across two impressive camps. But Tuchel intends to stay connected to those presently on the outside, to ensure they remain hungry for involvement, saying: “Maybe we have the chance to invite more ­players [in November] or share some minutes.” It is a delicate balance and the situation with Bellingham is surely the most delicate owing to his status in the game. Tuchel tried to make clear that the Real Madrid midfielder was only one player, albeit an excellent one; he is not a special case. Asked whether he would speak to Bellingham before the next camp, he said: “I guess so, why not? Of course, he’s an important player, he’s a big player. “I will speak to a lot of players … to the guys who were not in camp, they will get texts from me – especially them. The guys who are now here have the reward, they feel the reward and it’s now necessary also I stay in touch with the other guys. “No one has done anything wrong, it’s not a punishment or whatever, and I feel when I text them or I speak to them everyone is eager to come back. This is how it has to be and I have trust in more players than [those] here. We always speak about the same names [outside the squad] but we have Conor Gallagher, we have Trevoh Chalobah, we have Cole Palmer injured and a lot of other guys out there who deserve to be with us and are hungry and determined to be with us.” Tuchel has only the November and March camps before he names his squad for the finals and he has worked to streamline his options, to bring clarity in each position, defining the pecking order. Would November be a chance to make changes, given the ties are essentially meaningless in terms of results? Thomas Tuchel applauds the travelling England fans in Latvia. Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images “Maybe, but not too much,” Tuchel said. “It needs to be deserved, first of all, and it needs to make sense. We’ll have a review of the camp and then ask also my assistant coaches who are more experienced in World Cup qualifiers than me. We will get our heads around it and take the decision when it’s decision time.” Once again, Tuchel made plain that any player coming back in had to buy into his standards, which begin with putting the team first. “If we invite them we are sure they will buy in, or we will not invite them. Why would we?

54c0300fef7a,"Norris as Senna and Piastri as Prost? No, but McLaren must hope title is settled on track",,"M cLaren and Formula One could do with anything decisive in the championship battle between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri being decided on the track and without reference to the pit wall as the title run-in begins at the Circuit of the Americas on Friday. With the Singapore Grand Prix ’s doubtless extensive and tense debriefs dealt with, McLaren will be hoping for a reset. Norris was almost certainly more than aware of the historical context of his riposte to his aggrieved teammate at the last grand prix weekend. In a fiercely contested title fight with the Australian, that Norris invoked one of Ayrton Senna’s most famous sentiments was lost on no one but the incident that provoked his comment was of an entirely different nature to those that defined the Brazilian’s great rivalries. “If you fault me for just going on the inside of a big gap then you should not be in Formula One,” Norris said of his opening-lap attempt to pass that led to the cars colliding . The remark appeared to paraphrase Senna’s “If you no longer go for a gap that exists you are no longer a racing driver” defence he gave to Sir Jackie Stewart after he ploughed into Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990, ensuring he took the title. While the spirit is similar, the wording is where the similarities end. Senna later admitted he had no intent of letting Prost beat him through the first corner while Norris did try to make his pass cleanly at the Marina Bay circuit. Indeed, it was a perfectly valid effort that went unpenalised even with the glancing blow he made against his McLaren teammate as he went through. That itself was a result of him clipping the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in front of him. Piastri reacted furiously and, notably, immediately declared that Norris gaining the place was “unfair”; the implication being that the two teammates clashing was verboten under McLaren’s rules of engagement and Norris should be instructed to give back the place he had made. McLaren did not do so, but it was indicative that in any cases of contention between the two, both will promptly appeal to the team to intervene on his behalf. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri clashed in Singapore with pressure mounting in the drivers’ championship. Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty Images This is part and parcel of McLaren’s laudable efforts to let their drivers race one another and to try to be as scrupulously fair . Quite apart from tying some torturous knots in setting precedents over what constitutes fair or unfair – which, under these auspices, now includes misfortune, strategy and racing incidents such as in Singapore – there is the question of perception. Of most import to the title race, with six meetings remaining Piastri leads Norris by 22 points, there is what each driver perceives as fair and at what point their opinion may diverge with that of the McLaren pitwall. Which is when the amicable relationship between the two may – finally – become a little bit more Senna-Prost. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said after Singapore: “It’s going to come to a situation where a few points will matter. Then they’ll start to calculate and back-calculate and I guess the elbows are going to come out a bit more. That’s when it starts to get interesting.” For the audience, in what is a two-horse race, getting interesting will probably be welcomed in the form of an on-track confrontation rather than a spreadsheet-based arbitration of circumstances. Not least because for F1 the other impression from all this is not particularly rousing. To be fair, McLaren are making the correct decisions for themselves and it has paid off. They secured their 10th constructors’ title in Singapore (albeit a brilliant success overshadowed by the fuss prompted by the Norris-Piastri moment) and in Andrea Stella as team principal they have an ethical and principled leader who genuinely wants to do the right thing. Yet having drivers in a championship fight looking to the pitwall to decide matters is unedifying. Their contest should be decided on track. Chance and fate will play their part, but better to let them simply go at it and see how fortune falls, than the impression that every disputed moment will be pored over by the team to ascertain whether they need to intervene and then cleared up afterwards behind closed doors. The scrutiny will intensify and each time it happens it is in danger of potentially making a difference that could be critical. Already, after the team made their drivers swap places at Monza because Norris had endured a slow pit stop and Piastri feeling he had been hard done by with the strategy call at Hungary, where Norris won , the spectre of a fear of favouritism also looms. No one wants to see a title endlessly debated because it may be considered that the efforts to be fair had not been balanced. When asked if he felt the team had managed to do right by both drivers, Piastri said he believed they had, but noted that it was an ever-evolving approach. “There’s been some difficult situations and we’ve spoken about a number of things,” he said after Singapore. “But ultimately it’s a learning process with the whole team.” Six meetings remain. McLaren have little wriggle room left to do their cramming, so it may be better now to simply close the books and step back from the fray.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/13/lando-norris-ayrton-senna-oscar-piastri-alain-prost-mclaren-f1-title,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f94956a9ac3b04880e07e6d854aecea3511259/470_0_4699_3760/master/4699.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c408fb827463c32e2513f05314804781",2025-10-13T07:00:15+00:00,d35717f34eb7ec7ca8c711499e4504e2d7ad5987
13b611822893,Winter is coming: England’s cricketers fly out for long tour that will decide Ashes and World Cup,,"A meteorologist would say that England’s winter will start this year at midnight on 1 December; an astronomer would point a few weeks later to the 21st, perhaps even the moment at precisely 3.03pm when the northern hemisphere is tilted furthest away from the sun, the least sun-kissed moment of its least sunny day. But a cricket fan might go a little earlier, perhaps as soon as next Saturday at about 7.15am. Leaves might still be clinging to trees as yet unbothered by frost, but that is when the national side is scheduled to play its first fixture of a hectic touring schedule, and by the time it all ends the Ashes will have been decided, a World Cup will have been won, and it will be spring. For the players involved in all formats, these moments will bring a combination of excitement and perhaps also a bit of dread. The T20 squad departed for New Zealand on Friday, with the four men among them who have also been selected for the Ashes – Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse and Zak Crawley – knowing that only injury will bring them home within the next three months (and even then for no more than 10 days, before they depart again this time for Sri Lanka and from there a T20 World Cup in India). Four more members of the Ashes squad will follow along with the other ODI players not already there 10 days later, accompanied by a few Test bowlers, Mark Wood, Josh Tongue and Gus Atkinson among them, who are not due to play any white-ball cricket but want to work on their fitness. A full month before the Ashes starts in Perth most of England’s squad will be in New Zealand. There is only one official warmup game in Australia, against the Lions at Lilac Hill in the Perth suburbs, but by then few of the players should have any rust to work off. It is a formidable commitment, but not a novel one. Back in 1986 the players left one day earlier, on 9 October, and did not get home until 16 February. In the Guardian Matthew Engel raged that “the itinerary is an outrage … Lord’s have meekly agreed to a tour that treats the players as little more than air freight.” Graham Gooch, their best opener, took one look at the schedule and made his excuses. “My wife and I have just had twins, and my family commitments mean I can’t go away for four and a half months,” he said. “I studied the itinerary to see if I could get them out there but … I couldn’t make it work.” Graham Gooch, pictured here during the 1987 Cricket World Cup semi-final, opted to not go on tour the previous year due to the intense schedule. Photograph: Adrian Murrell/Allsport/Getty Images By the time the tour ended, Mike Gatting, England’s captain, was pleading with the authorities to learn and change. “We knew at the beginning it was going to be hard,” he said at the time. “We had an itinerary to fulfil and we’ve done it as best we can, but now the lads are tired.” When they landed at Heathrow, Gatting warned “too much cricket will kill a few players before they are ready to be killed”. Four decades later not a lot has changed, and if the state matches that used to pad out tours of Australia have been abandoned plenty T20s have sprung up to replace them. “That was a long, long trip,” Gatting says now. If today’s players don’t have it much easier, Gatting says those closest to them do. “It was the wives, looking after kids on their own, who struggled,” he says. “The families are looked after so much better than when we played. If they came out we had to pay for them, pay for their flights and their hotels, and quite rightly that’s all changed. Before it was horrible. There’s so much of a better atmosphere now. And there are probably only four or five players who will be involved in all of England’s games this winter, when we used to play all the competitions.” England played 30 games on that trip, including state and ceremonial matches, and Gatting appeared in all but four of them. Of the 19 full internationals across two formats and three competitions – the Ashes, the Perth Challenge (a four-team ODI tournament arranged to mark the America’s Cup and the completion of some new floodlights at the Waca) and the World Series Cup (another ODI tournament involving three of those same four teams), Gatting was one of six players who appeared in every one and eight who were picked at least 17 times. Miraculously, and against most expectations, England won the lot. “Playing for your country is what you aim for, always,” Gatting says. “It’s something you want to do. And in this day and age it’s made slightly easier because of the way families are treated and that’s so important. We struggled to make phone calls, we had to write letters home. It’s a hard trip, but going to Australia for the Ashes, it’s fantastic. As an England player it’s the one series you want to be involved in.” There are no repeats now of the experience of Worcestershire’s Don Kenyon, who returned from England’s tour of India in 1952 to meet for the first time a daughter who was already four months old. And compared with some past tours this is but a blink: when England boarded a train for Tilbury at London’s St Pancras on the morning of 18 September 1920 it started an unbroken period of 462 days – a little over one year and three months – in which either they or the Australians, who played in England the following summer, were on an Ashes tour. The English players were away for seven months and five days, Australia’s – having popped in to South Africa for three Tests on the way home – for nine months and two days. Compared with some of their forebears, it is not just with white balls and limited overs that Friday’s travellers are dealing in short formats.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/england-ashes-world-cup-schedule-cricket,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/428c6773ca307091b611f7ff5ca1b5efeab2edeb/153_81_2763_2211/master/2763.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ec52e669f18a712ba0646f6fd02e1a7",2025-10-11T07:00:18+00:00,1c5aa494c34504a130ddd8c58607269b7c147abe
90afc05dca50,Good news: men have stopped disrupting women’s sport with dildos. Bad news: now they’re betting on their periods,,"F orget the bald eagle or the Statue of Liberty – the best symbol of modern America may well be a neon green dildo. Women’s basketball fans will know exactly what I’m talking about. On 29 July , a brightly coloured sex toy was thrown on to the court during the final minutes of play in a WNBA game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. In the weeks that followed, more neon dildos were flung at female basketball players, with at least six WNBA games disrupted. The culprits were reportedly members of a cryptocurrency group trying to boost a memecoin called Green Dildo Coin . It was all very 2025: brainrot stunts, get-rich-quick schemes and memeified misogyny. And, of course, the Trump family joined in. Donald Trump Jr, who fancies himself an edgelord, posted a crude meme of his dad throwing a green dildo on to a court of young, female basketball players. Thanks to a couple of arrests and threats of perpetrators being banned from games, dildo-flinging has now died down. However, women’s basketball is still attracting a lot of toxic attention. The latest indignity professional players are being forced to put up with? Period betting: gamblers are trying to figure out where a player is in her menstrual cycle and are predicting her athletic performance accordingly. It’s hard to know just how widespread the phenomenon is, but Wired recently reported that an increasing number of sports betting influencers are sharing their tips on the strategy. One Instagram user called fademebets, for example, published a video of basketball star Caitlin Clark earlier this year where he announced : “She is on the end of her late luteal phase, meaning a decrease in cardio, decrease in strength, decrease in aerobic system. She’s going to be tired more often than in a normal game.” How on earth would some random internet user know where a professional athlete is in her cycle? Most of the time it seems they are just guessing. On the podcast Stuff Island, comedian James McCann said he had met a gambler who used injury reports, including references to “soreness”, to estimate menstrual cycles. Give it some time, however, and perhaps they’ll start hacking commercial period tracking apps, many of which already leak sensitive user data. Earlier this year, for example, a federal jury found that Meta violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by collecting data from Flo, a popular period tracking app, without user consent. While period cycle betting is invasive and creepy, these gamblers aren’t entirely off-base in their reasoning: your menstrual cycle can have an impact on your athletic performance. Indeed, researchers at University College London just published a study that found female athletes have faster reaction times during ovulation. Perhaps, if we’re looking for silver linings, there is some positive benefit to men getting interested in luteal phases and women’s hormone levels. Perhaps if we get enough gamblers deciding there is money to be made from this, we’ll see more resources go towards women’s health, which is chronically underfunded ? Humour me here: I’m trying to be positive. It’s difficult, but I’m trying. If we are really trying to look on the bright side, the rise of period betting points to just how popular women’s sports are becoming . Women’s football, for example, already one of the top 10 most followed sports globally, is on track to become one of the top five sports by 2030 , according to Nielsen Sports. And, halfway through the 2025 season, WNBA ratings are breaking records and drawing in a broader fanbase. The New York Times reports that the number of boys under 18 who watch WNBA has grown by 130% over the past four years. Whenever women are in the spotlight, though, there are people who punish them for it. The joy and excitement of the Women’s World Cup in 2023, for example, was overshadowed by Luis Rubiales, the former president of the Spanish Football Federation, kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent. It “stained one of the happiest days of my life”, Hermoso said at the time . And there was a record number of reports of abuse at matches in English football during the 2024-25 season, according to data from Kick It Out ; complaints of misogyny and sexism drove this increase. Whether it’s sexist chants, dildo tossing or period cycle betting, the world is full of small men desperate to spoil a woman’s big moment.

4dea49da5fd5,Luke Littler’s poker face may be one of the keys to his dominance in darts,,"S unday night in Leicester. A study in contrast. At one point Luke Humphries’s eyes widen as another 22g Red Dragon dart flies past double 16. He shakes his head. Looks down. Bites his lip. Meanwhile, the automaton beside him powers on. Until the moment Luke Littler is pumping his fists, revelling in his 6-1 victory and a first World Grand Prix title. Littler’s extraordinary immunity to pressure is fast reaching the stage where even peak-era Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal would be taking notes. In his quarter-final against Gerwyn Price, Littler looked down and out at times until he hit a 156 checkout to clinch the match. Against Humphries, it didn’t matter that his three-dart average was more than a point lower as he won five of his six sets in final-leg deciders. Luke the Nuke? More like Luke the nerveless. While the 18-year-old often reacted after a 180 or winning double against Humphries, there was barely a flicker of emotion between darts. That, according to Philip Furley, a senior lecturer at the German Sport University in Cologne, is significant. Furley has just published a new study in the Psychology of Sport and Exercise journal, which suggests that even the tiniest of facial tics and movements before a player throws a dart can indicate whether they will hit a high or low score . Furley has a history in this area. Previously, he has shown players are more likely to miss penalties if they turn their back to the keeper beforehand or take less time than usual before their kick. “We called this hastening and hiding behaviour,” he says. “If you see something like that in the pressurised performance context that’s often a sign the play is not going to do so well.” Darts is another laboratory. Many of its pleasures come from its purity. Dart and board, eye and nerve. A player is only ever seconds away from needing a big score or a double; to silence the self-talk in their head or the hecklers in the crowd. Every throw and thrower is captured by TV cameras, allowing it to be assessed. Gerwyn Price missed match darts in a psychological battle with Luke Littler at last week’s World Grand Prix. Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images Essentially, that is what Furley did, as he looked at scoring and facial attributes at the 2017 PDC World Darts Championships. High-performance scores, ranging from 103 to 180 points, were contrasted with low-performance scores between 0 and 75. A program called Facial Action Coding System, which breaks down facial expressions into 20 individual small segments, was used to track whether players did things like wrinkle their nose, raise their upper lip or close their eyes each time they threw. Furley says there were extremely limited facial muscle movements immediately before throwing a dart, but a “clear pattern of results emerged” showing that the players whose face did not change scored better. “What we reliably find is that more tension around the eyes and around the mouth is an indicator of suboptimal performance,” Furley says. “While less tension seems to be an indicator that, OK, he is going to perform better.” skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Furley’s study was based on data collected before Littler burst on to the scene. But as a keen darts watcher he is in awe of how psychologically mature he is at the board. “Having a poker face, and not really showing much of these muscle movements that are a sign of tension, is something these absolute top performers like Littler seem to have more often.” Furley’s research is part of a wider drive to examine unintentional non-verbal cues in sport. Some of it is obvious. You did not need a PhD in psychology to sense Frank Bruno was anxious when he crossed himself more than a dozen times on the way to the ring before his second fight with Mike Tyson. But there are some things that may surprise you. A study on 152 Ultimate Fighting athletes found that increased smile intensity in the pre-fight photograph was associated with poorer performance by the fighter showing the smile. Why? Well, according to the researchers, smiles are a nonverbal sign of reduced hostility and aggression and thereby unintentionally communicate reduced physical dominance . There are exceptions in all this. Zinedine Zidane once vomited before taking a penalty against England in a Euro 2004 group match, due to tiredness and nerves. He still scored. Littler too showed he isn’t infallible when he surprisingly lost to Beau Greaves at the World Youth Championship on Monday. Cameron Menzies in deep concentration as he throws a dart. A study showed that players whose face did not change scored better. Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images So what is next? Furley says facial recognition software now exists to track whether a player is showing more evidence of nervousness and tension in real-time. He has also just submitted a study for review that is based on Fifa kinematic datasets that track the skeletons of all 22 players in real time. “When we put boxes around the players and measure how upright the head is, how upright the body is and how open the shoulders are we see some really interesting things,” he says. Such as? “The more upright a player is, it seems to be a clear sign they are on top of their game and things are going better for the team,. And being head down and a bit slumped, with shoulders inwards, seem clear indicators the team’s not doing very well.” Much of that, as Furley says, is intuitive. Even so, it is interesting when the evidence backs up our instincts.

1a800f96540a,Pogacar rules cycling world with total pedal power after brushing off mid-season blues,,"Tadej Pogacar’s command of world cycling now seems limitless. The man from Slovenia ended 2025 as he began it, dominating a coveted Italian classic, Il Lombardia, to win the “race of the falling leaves” for the fifth consecutive time . The 27-year-old started his European season by winning the Tuscan gravel race, Strade Bianche. He closed it having matched Italian icon Fausto Coppi’s record of five Lombardy wins and Eddy Merckx’s achievement of winning three “monument” races, the Tour de France and the world road race title in the same year. In late July, however, a weary Pogacar talked about early retirement and a sense of burnout, even as he took his fourth yellow jersey . His mid-season low came towards the end of that Tour win, when he seemed withdrawn and disgruntled, as the race closed on Paris. There were whispered rumours that he had been asked to back off a little and resist further stage wins to avoid reducing the Tour to a procession. In fact, Pogacar told Slovenian media on Monday that he had come close to quitting the 2025 Tour, while leading the race, due to a worsening knee injury. “The day after the stage finish on Mont Ventoux, I had problems with my knee and started to have doubts about whether I would be able to continue,” he said, adding that the cold weather during the subsequent Alpine stages didn’t help. “It was cold and my body went on the defensive. My body was in shock. I had had enough of everything.” After a post-Tour sabbatical, during which he trained in kit bearing the messages “Do Not Disturb” and “No Photography”, he came back, seemingly revitalised, winning the world and European road races titles. Only Remco Evenepoel, the world and Olympic time-trial champion, was able to hang on to his back wheel. By the end of the season, Pogacar was insatiable. “I always say, seven years in a row, this is my best season,” he said after winning in Lombardy on Saturday. “And again I can say this is the best season so far.” In comparison, Jonas Vingegaard, second to Pogacar in the Tour, rebooted himself to take victory in a troubled Vuelta a España , where the presence of the Israel Premier-Tech team led to mass pro-Palestinian protests and the cancellation of the final stage in Madrid. That team is now to undergo a rebrand, after pressure from rival teams, race organisers and even their own star rider , Derek Gee, who cited “serious concerns” which he said “weighed heavily” on his conscience, forced change. Over the season, the only rider to come close to matching Pogacar’s spring-to-autumn longevity has been a revitalised Tom Pidcock, the Briton who chased him over the Tuscan hills to second place in Siena back in February and was in hot pursuit on Saturday in Lombardy, finishing sixth. Pidcock’s rebirth, which led to his best-ever finish in a Grand Tour, third in the Vuelta, was mirrored by another Ineos Sport exile and fellow Olympic mountain biking champion, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, who took the first French win in the Tour de France this century. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot’s weight loss became a talking point after she won the Tour de France Femmes. Photograph: Jérôme Delay/AP Ferrand-Prévot’s climbing performances on the final weekend of the Tour de France Femmes overwhelmed past champions Demi Vollering and Kasia Niewiadoma, and led to jubilation in the Alps. But her win also sparked a debate about extreme weight loss in the women’s peloton, with even Ferrand-Prévot admitting it was unsustainable and rival rider Marlen Reusser saying “we secretly hoped she wouldn’t be successful.” Asked by Dutch journalists if she should lose more weight to compete with Ferrand-Prévot, Vollering responded: “I want to set a good example. I hope I can win again and show girls you don’t have to be super-skinny and that if you have the power and you train hard, you can make it.” There were other breakthrough performances in French cycling, with the most notable coming from teenager Paul Seixas, whose win in the Tour de l’Avenir, allied to third place behind Pogacar and Evenepoel in the European Championships, led to roadside banners proclaiming “Seixas is better than sex”. Great things are now expected from the Lyon-based rider, but given the pressures being heaped on him, many are hoping that unlike other French prodigies, he can survive the hype and prosper. The year however, has belonged to Pogacar, yet again. Some are enthralled by his domination, others are left cold by his long solo attacks, while others find it unsettling. Whichever camp you fall into, it’s an indication of cycling’s inability to ever reconcile itself with its troubled past that some remain sceptical of extraordinary performances.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/13/tadej-pogacar-rules-cycling-world-il-lombardia-tour-de-france-2025,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2027ed0f9cfba8828be067e98951efe85245f73/606_0_4663_3732/master/4663.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1458250802e5bddf56a188a5266ac8e3",2025-10-13T11:30:20+00:00,8fdb11c3413f9747ca0e14f165b1153da6bac5e8
d8b34137e625,Hull KR aim for more while triumph brings hope for all Super League teams,,"F or the first time in two decades Super League woke up on Sunday morning with a name other than Wigan Warriors , St Helens or Leeds Rhinos as its champions. Hull KR are the first new winners of the competition since 2004, and only the fifth in history to be crowned at all. For the Robins this is a watershed moment. Without a major trophy in 40 years before this season, they have now completed a historic treble in 2025 and are arguably Super League’s premier club side. For the wider competition as a whole, though, their success could not have come at a better time. Sport thrives on unpredictability so the fact that three teams have dominated the past 20 years of Super League has left many feeling the need for a new force to rise. With the competition expanding to 14 teams in 2026 – the new-look lineup will be announced in the coming days – there is a need for fresh stories and fresh clubs to dominate the airwaves. Rovers have not only ended a closed shop this year, they have hammered down its doors with a Robin-shaped battering ram. That feels fitting after a season that has delivered the promise of several new clubs coming to the fore and looking as if they can now emulate the new champions and themselves smash Super League’s glass ceiling. Castleford, Catalans Dragons, Hull FC, Warrington and Salford have reached at least one grand final, fallen short and then fallen back into the mire: all five finished in the bottom half this season. But with Hull KR now on top, there is a clear belief that a new, expanded Super League can yield more new champions. There has been that long-craved unpredictability and feeling of freshness throughout this year that, aside from the obvious story of Hull KR’s rise to greatness, is an immense positive for Super League going into 2026. Leigh Leopards’ third-placed finish shows they are not too far behind the Robins, while Leeds rose from eighth last year to fourth this season. Wakefield Trinity were playing in the Championship in 2024 but they made the Super League playoffs after promotion, underlining that clubs – including Toulouse and York, who are vying for promotion this time around – do not simply have to be content with scrambling to avoid finishing bottom of Super League. Hull KR’s Jez Litten celebrates scoring his team’s third try against Wigan.

If anything, you’ve got to work even harder because you’re there to be chased. We’ll be chased next year but I’m looking forward to it.” The majority of this squad is contracted long term and their biggest problem is how long they can keep their coach, Willie Peters, from the lure of the National Rugby League. Peters’s stock has risen further with this triumph but his immediate focus in 2026 will be a World Club Challenge against Brisbane Broncos. That has been pencilled in for 20 February but the venue is yet to be determined. It will be in England, with Rovers’ Craven Park home and the MKM Stadium, home of Hull FC, options at this stage. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Irrespective of that game, Rovers are now a bona fide force in British rugby league. They finished bottom of Super League as recently as 2020 but players such as Minchella and the final’s undoubted star, Mikey Lewis, have heralded a new era not only for Hull KR but for Super League as a whole. Suddenly, anyone has the right to believe it could be their year in 2026. The action is not over this year, though; in fact, it is just beginning. Several players from the Super League champions look likely to be included in Shaun Wane’s 24-man England squad for this autumn’s Ashes. The squad will be revealed on Monday lunchtime, with the first Test at Wembley on 25 October. Lewis is certain to be selected and based on what he has done this year – especially in the grand final – it would be a major surprise were he not in the side for the first match of the series. Should England manage to win the Ashes for the first time since 1970, it could catapult league to new heights in this country after Rovers’ domestic success.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/hull-kr-aim-for-more-while-triumph-brings-hope-for-all-super-league-teams,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c806409b4acd2bf0a2ac50e02ab109146d8f87ff/518_0_4545_3636/master/4545.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=673eee4921a6dbfe3095070c1a357f28",2025-10-12T14:02:34+00:00,67305345ce56ee934bcabac893f36df7247c0b1f
2fb8b30a0afd,Spicy songs and Tuchel in spotlight as England get set for World Cup furnace,,"LOUD ENOUGH? Following the murine pitch invasion in which a rat halted Tuesday’s match between Wales and Belgium, Football Daily rather hoped a like-minded, attention-seeking bear, elk or wild boar might inject some much-needed jeopardy into England’s methodical 5-0 rout of Latvia by emerging from the long row of trees at the side of Riga’s Daugova Stadium and wandering on to the field of play. Sadly, there were no such comedy wildlife incursions, so as England piled the hurt (and goals) on their hosts, their travelling fans chose instead to amuse themselves by relentlessly ribbing Thomas Tuchel, who had been extremely critical of the library-level silence during England’s dismantling of Wales at Wembley. “I got a bit of stick and I found it quite creative,” parped Tuchel, having spent the evening being serenaded by fans insisting they would sing when they want, among other pertinent ditties containing effing and jeffing that has no place in a family football email. “It made me smile. It’s British humour and I can take it. No harm done.” While you wouldn’t think there had been no harm done going by some of the pearl-clutching and pulpit-thumping which greeted this fan mockery in a few write-ups of the match, such has been the ease with which England have qualified for the Geopolitics World Cup that it is no surprise selected commentators felt compelled to confect outrage and hysteria out of nowt rather than just focus on a job being well done, albeit against extremely limited opposition. While the good news is that England have qualified with two games to spare, having won six out of six without conceding a goal in Group K, there’s no getting away from the fact that they have done so against three nations and a ski resort with a combined world ranking of 411. An undeniably promising side whose sole defeat under Tuchel came in the only match they’ve played against reasonably fancied opposition in Senegal , we don’t yet know how good this work in process could be. Worryingly, their next matches of any major importance could be played in conditions so hot that the incessant parping of that effing brass band will be drowned out by the sound of Anthony Gordon’s skin crackling in the early afternoon sun. With the draw for the GWC not taking place until December, handwringing over the potentially devastating and thus far overlooked effects of the American heat on England’s chances will have to wait, so for now the likely passenger manifest of The Plane has come under the microscope. In his three camps to date, Tinkering Tom has picked 37 different players, which means no fewer than 11 are going to be left gutted upon discovering there’s no place for them in his plans. And that’s before you get to the in-form Jack Grealish and Adam Wharton, who have yet to get a look-in. “That should have been Adam Wharton,” tooted the former of the latter upon being presented with the player-of-the-match award when Everton beat Crystal Palace before the international break. With just two more of those to go before Tuchel picks his squad, it looks increasingly likely that both players could miss out next summer. It is a measure of just how much talent there is at England’s disposal that the duo may not even be the most conspicuous absentees.

I’m between jobs and just left the Premier League. I’m open to anything, really, where I feel I can help. The job as head coach of the Swedish national team is fantastic. I have feelings for Sweden. I love the country and I love Swedish football. I have a lot to be grateful for towards Swedish football. So yes, it would be a fantastic opportunity for me, obviously” – Graham Potter wraps himself in an imaginary blue and yellow bow and issues the mother of all come-and-get-me-pleas to the Swedish FA.

But then I realised I am being gaslighted (gaslit?). That picture was used in an article in the Sunday Times ( Paddle out to see the puffins in Northumberland, Sunday 18 July 2021) and, of course, it is used in a more generic way on a Turkish site ( evrenatlasi.com.tr , 1 Nisan 2022). So who to believe? The Sunday Times or Getty Images or Football Daily? I assume that all your stuff is underwritten by The Man to ensure accuracy and that you aren’t allowed to write any old rubb … oh, er...

6eb639c16c48,WSL talking points: Arsenal face dilemma and Blindkilde Brown gives Wiegman nudge,,"Arsenal face Cooney-Cross conundrum The disquiet over Kyra Cooney-Cross’s lack of action has grown louder by the week and her 27-minute cameo in Arsenal’s 1-0 defeat of Brighton fuelled her case for a start. The Australian midfielder impressed when she featured last season and there were high hopes for her going into this campaign, but four games glued to the bench have been followed by 54 minutes as a substitute across the following three matches. Brighton were, by their own admission, tiring towards the end of their 1-0 defeat and Cooney-Cross’s ball-carrying and front-foot approach caught the eye as the Gunners tried to extend their lead. “When there’s a drop-off [in] minute 60 or 75 and intensity goes down in games and space becomes bigger, the gamechangers can make a real impact, and that’s 100% what Kyra did,” said the Arsenal manager Renée Slegers. “She capitalised on the spaces and the fatigue and the opposition team and she plays with a lot of confidence and forward intent and she brings all her best qualities to life today, so I’m really pleased.” The preferred midfield trio this season has been Kim Little, Mariona Caldentey and Frida Maanum, with Victoria Pelova also featuring and Alessia Russo dropping into the 10 on occasion. It is hard to see where Cooney-Cross fits into the equation, but with Arsenal struggling to assert authority, change may not be a bad thing. Suzanne Wrack Match report: Arsenal 1-0 Brighton No home comforts for Everton Everton have lost all three of their home fixtures this season – their longest losing streak at home since the autumn of 2023 – and gone five home WSL matches without a win, stretching back to a victory over last season’s relegated side, Crystal Palace, last March. Their struggles at home continued on Sunday despite a change of venue to play at the mightily impressive Hill Dickinson Stadium, where they continued their long wait for a victory over Manchester United – this was their 13th WSL meeting with United without a win. Brian Sørensen’s team have looked strong on the road this term but cannot seem to find home form, and perhaps they need to focus on making Goodison Park feel like “home”. Sunday was the sixth stadium the club have hosted WSL fixtures in, and they did not win their first WSL game at any: Marine AFC’s Rossett Park, Widnes’s Halton Stadium, Southport’s Haig Avenue, Walton Hall Park, Goodison Park and Hill Dickinson Stadium. Creating a fortress feels like a priority.

Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters Has Blindkilde Brown earned an England call? The Manchester City midfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown has made a timely burst into great form before Sarina Wiegman’s England squad announcement on Tuesday morning, providing a player-of-the-match display in the win against Liverpool. The 22-year-old, voted by City supporters as their player of the month for September, looks to have found her best position in a City shirt since she dropped into a deeper central midfield role alongside Yui Hasegawa under Andrée Jeglertz, having played as a No 10 for much of the time since arriving in January 2024. She enjoyed plenty of possession at Anfield and has started six City games in succession in all competitions. She has one England cap but could she add to that in the friendlies against Brazil and Australia this month? TG Match report: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester City Spurs show defensive mettle There was a moment in the first half that summed up Sunday’s encounter between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Keira Walsh unleashed a fierce 20-yard effort and Bethany England stepped up, body on the line, to take the full force of the shot at close range. The captain picked herself up immediately, shaken but not broken, a symbol of Spurs’ courageous defensive display. It will be one that the manager, Martin Ho, can take plenty of pride in despite a 1-0 defeat. “When you can put in defensive performances like that, it sets you up for success moving forward,” he said. “If you get the foundation right, you become hard to beat.” Chelsea dominated – 66% possession; 27 shots; 68 touches in Spurs’ box – but for the most part struggled to break down their opposition, a continuation of a recent trend of a lack of clinical finishing from the Blues.

The Foxes have not won a WSL away match since a victory at Everton on 28 January 2024 – in which time they have gone through four managers – and Passmoor had hoped to break the streak in his first match as the permanent manager, having been in interim charge from early September until last Friday. Despite the outcome, Passmoor was determined to look at the positives. “What a squad performance,” he said. “You’re coming to Villa Park, local derby, you’ve got a team that know exactly how they want to play and we know they’re a team of very good players individually. So we had to match them as a group and as a team … To come to Villa Park and get a clean sheet and a point, we will take that.” Emillia Hawkins Leicester’s goalkeeper, Janina Leitzig, thwarts Ebony Salmon of Aston Villa during their goalless draw. Photograph: Jan Kruger/AVFC/Getty Images London City need more ruthless touch Kosovare Asllani’s instinctive finish proved the difference as London City Lionesses edged past West Ham for a second successive WSL win. It was another step forward for a side still bedding in 17 summer signings, but one that again highlighted their lack of cutting edge. Jocelyn Prêcheur’s team showed promising movement and spells of control, yet moments of hesitation under pressure allowed West Ham chances, with Viviane Asseyi coming closest, clipping the post from distance. The London City midfielder Leah Godfrey admitted the team were “still missing the finishing touches in the final third”, though Asllani’s goal showed her experience and brought a timely injection of confidence. Prêcheur stressed the need to be more efficient in transitions and clinical. The foundations are being laid and connections are starting to form, but if London City are to turn progress into consistency, a more ruthless streak will be essential.

c1b00f9eb047,Virginia Giuffre Recalls Jeffrey Epstein’s Abuse and Trafficking in Harrowing Memoir Excerpt,,"Virginia Giuffre recounts her recruitment by Ghislaine Maxwell at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort , the first time Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused her, and being allegedly trafficked to billionaires, academics, politicians, and even Prince Andrew in the first excerpt from her posthumous memoir, Nobody’s Girl , published in The Guardian . Giuffre, who died by suicide this past April, spent the last few years of her life working on her memoir, reportedly completing the manuscript last fall. It’s now set to be published on Oct. 21 . As one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers , many of Giuffre’s most harrowing allegations have already come out in lawsuits and court documents. And while the book still finds her offering an extensive account of her time being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell, she also reflects on the abuse she suffered as a child, and her decision to come forward about Epstein and Maxwell. As she writes in the new Nobody’s Girl excerpt, Giuffre fell into Epstein’s orbit after taking a job at Mar-a-Lago, where her dad also worked. She briefly describes meeting Trump at the resort, and how the future president — and known Epstein associate — helped her find additional work babysitting for wealthy friends who lived nearby. A few weeks before turning 17, Giuffre writes that Maxwell spotted her walking towards the spa at Mar-a-Lago, holding a book on anatomy, which the teen had “jammed with sticky notes.” Picking up on Giuffre’s interest in learning massage, Giuffre says Maxwell invited her to meet Epstein later that night, as the financier was “looking for a massage therapist to travel with him.” Giuffre recalls how the walls of Epstein’s home were “crowded with photos and paintings of nude women.” She also remembers Epstein was already naked on a massage table when she met him for the first time. Giuffre says Maxwell taught her how to massage Epstein, and at one point “put her hands on top of mine and guided them to [Epstein’s] rear.” She writes: “Only later would I see how, step by practiced step, the two of them were breaking down my defenses. Every time I felt a twinge of discomfort, one glance at Maxwell told me I was overreacting. And so it went for about half an hour: a seemingly legitimate massage lesson.” During the massage, Giuffre says Epstein asked her increasingly probing questions, including whether she took birth control and the first time she had sex. When Giuffre alluded to having spent time on the street as a runaway, she says Epstein teased her for being a “naughty girl.” When Giuffre rebuffed him, Epstein replied, “It’s OK. I like naughty girls.” At that point, Giuffre writes, Epstein “rolled over onto his back” and revealed his erection. Giuffre says Maxwell kept showing her how to massage Epstein, who then began to masturbate and asked, “You don’t mind, do you?” Giuffre says this was “the moment that something cracked inside me,” describing her memories as “jagged shards”: “Maxwell peeling off her clothes, a mischievous look on her face; Maxwell behind me, unzipping my skirt and pulling my Mar-a-Lago polo shirt over my head; Epstein and Maxwell laughing at my underwear, which were dotted with tiny hearts. ‘How cute — she still wears little girl’s panties,’ Epstein said. He reached for a vibrator, which he forced between my thighs, as Maxwell commanded me to pinch Epstein’s nipples as she rubbed her own breasts, and mine.” The excerpt continues: “I could feel my brain begin to shut down. My body couldn’t escape from this room, but my mind couldn’t bear to stay, so it put me on a kind of autopilot: submissive and determined to survive.” Not long after this encounter, Giuffre says Epstein convinced her to quit her job at Mar-a-Lago and work for him. She says he gave her money to move into her own apartment and not-so-subtly threatened her to keep quiet about what happened inside the house. Giuffre claims Epstein showed her a blurry photo of her brother at his school, and claimed to “own the Palm Beach police department.” She then writes about when Epstein and Maxwell “began lending [her] out to their friends.” These included: A billionaire with a pregnant wife, a “psychology professor whose research Epstein was helping to fund,” academics, scientists, “a gubernatorial candidate who was soon to win election in a western state, and a former U.S. senator.” Giuffre says Epstein did not introduce these men to her by name, and she only learned some of their identities “years later, when [she] studied photographs of Epstein’s associates and recognized their faces.” The excerpt ends with Giuffre recalling her first alleged encounter with Prince Andrew in 2001. (Andrew has long denied Giuffre’s allegations and settled a high-profile sexual assault suit with her in 2022.) Upon introducing them, Giuffre says Maxwell encouraged Andrew to guess Giuffre’s age. After he correctly guessed 17, Giuffre writes that Andrew allegedly told her, “My daughters are just a little younger than you.” Giuffre says Maxwell then joked, “I guess we will have to trade her in soon.” After a night out, Giuffre says Maxwell instructed her, “When we get home, you are to do for [Andrew] what you do for Jeffrey.” Recalling Andrew’s alleged behavior that night, Giuffre writes that he was “friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.” Giuffre says Epstein gave her $15,000 “for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy.’” Gifuffre recalls two other alleged encounters with Andrew, one at Epstein’s townhouse in New York, the other on Epstein’s infamous private island. The latter she describes as “an orgy,” quoting a previous deposition where she said it included Epstein, Andrew, and “eight other young girls.” In the memoirs writes that Epstein told her that Jean-Luc Brunel, the late French modeling agent, “supplied the other girls who took part.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/virginia-giuffre-epstein-abuse-prince-andrew-book-1235448211,Entertainment,the guardians,Jon Blistein,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2207574917.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-15T21:27:23+00:00,48b3e7a9a3fa5faf96d12949cc2f47ffca623f92
12ef79e98f3b,Red Bandanna Girl: Meet the Viral Fan Who Stood Up for Billie Eilish,,"Aniyah Saint-Surin was about to live her dream. A lifelong Billie Eilish fan , Saint-Surin was finally able to see the Hit Me Hard and Soft singer for the first time in concert when Eilish began her tour at Kaseya Center in Miami on Oct. 9 . The tickets had come together at the last minute, and with the help of her aunt, Saint-Surin had thrown together a serviceable outfit, complete with a red bandanna that had been gathering dust in the corner of her room. The clothes didn’t matter — she was there to see her Billie. Saint-Surin has seen countless Eilish concerts through her phone screen, so she knew what was going to happen next. After hearing Eilish sing “Guess,” her hit collab with Charli XCX , Saint-Surin could see Eilish getting ready to run past the crowded barricade. This was what she had been waiting for, when Eilish would hop down from her stage and speed past a hoard of waiting fans, arms all outstretched for a second of contact. This was her moment. Eilish had just touched Saint-Surin’s fingertips when everything went haywire. A fan grabbed Eilish, and the singer went down hard — slamming into the metal barricade . “Instantly, something clicked,” Saint-Surin tells Rolling Stone . Before she even realized what she was doing, she was pushing the fan away, leaving her coveted spot at the barricade — and her chance to interact with Eilish again — to loudly berate the man for grabbing Eilish so roughly. A few minutes later, she was back in her spot, shaken up but convinced no one had noticed her actions. Saint-Surin has been listening to Billie Eilish for as long as she can remember — at least six years — which for an 18-year-old, is a substantial chunk of her life. Since Eilish released her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, in 2019, Saint-Surin has been a self-proclaimed stan, following the Los-Angeles based singer as she went from an industry newcomer to a Grammy- and Academy Award-winning powerhouse. She watched Eilish’s concerts via TikToks, streamed interviews on YouTube, and of course played her music constantly. “When tickets dropped, I got everyone, my brother, my sister, everybody on their Ticketmaster app,” she says. “I just kept saying ‘I need these Billie tickets. I need them!’” She was still overwhelmed to be at her first ever Eilish concert, so she regaled her family with the story later that night, but went to bed thinking it would be forgotten by the time she woke up. When she fell asleep, she had about 70 followers on TikTok . Five days later, she’s reached half a million. What Surin didn’t know was that the night of her concert, several clips of her yelling at the fan that grabbed Eilish slowly went viral online, garnering posts from Finneas and Reneé Rapp . Ticket reselling company StubHub got her tickets to the next show, making sure she could finally live her dream of touching hand with Eilish. Through her tour manager, Eilish got Saint-Surin’s brother a ticket to a show — and even sent Saint-Surin several pieces of merch to thank her for her actions. (The fan who grabbed Eilish has not been identified.) The viral video comes as artists have become more vocal about fan behavior at concerts that can put them in danger. In a 2023 interview with the Hollywood Reporter , Eilish herself noted that when fans are excited, trying to grab her or throw things , it can get scary. “People just get excited and it can be dangerous. I have mixed feelings about it, because when you’re up there it blows,” Eilish said. “But you know it’s out of love and they’re just trying to give you something. You’re in a vulnerable position, but I’ve been getting hit with stuff for, like, years.” Now Saint-Surin is a hero online, dubbed with the moniker “Red Bandanna Girl” for the red headscarf that was on her head when she went after the fan who grabbed Eilish. For her first public interview, Saint-Surin spoke to Rolling Stone about her love for Eilish, the deterioration of concert etiquette, and why it might be time for fandoms to have a reckoning in their ranks. How long have you been a music lover? Do you have a preferred genre? I love this question. It all depends what mood I’m in. I’ve been listening since I can remember, and I’m so deeply in love with all the genres and the feelings they give me. From pop to hip-hop and K-pop, I love it all. I love music so much. Like, what would I do without it? As someone who loves so many different genres, what draws you in about Billie Eilish as an artist? I’ve been a Billie stan for six years. It feels like I watched her grow — well, I did watch her grow — but it’s like this connection that she has with us. Call stans crazy, but I swear it’s real. What really connected me to Billie’s music was the way she puts her stories and experiences and traumas into something so beautiful that helps millions of other girls like me also get through obstacles in their lives. From watching her interviews and personality, everything about her character is so captivating to me. When you’re a fan and you find your artists, it’s like … they just get it. How many Billie concerts have you been to before this viral incident? Thursday was my very first time. As someone who’s been a fan for so many years, that must have felt a bit overwhelming. Oh, my gosh. As I walked into that arena and I grabbed that barricade, it felt like every time I closed my eyes, I was going to be in bed, and I’ve never felt that way before, like it’s more than a dream, one, like this is not even real. I’ve watched her do this show online. But to really look at that stage and look at everybody excited around me, and I’m talking to people about her, It did not feel real. Yeah, I kept falling to the ground. I kept falling to the ground. Walk me through the incident with the fan. OK, so Billie has two stages, a small stage and the main stage, which is a long rectangle. So she sings “Guess” and then “Everything I Wanted” and I realized, “Wait, this is when Billie does the crowd walk.” So I rushed back to my barricade spot, and my girls saved my spot. So I get there and I just hold on. I’m like, “This is it.” This was my dream. This is every stan’s dream, just to be able to have that second of contact with their favorite artists. It just means so much. So Billie’s walking down. I have my phone [tight to my chest]  because I want to remember this, but  I don’t want the phone in my face. But the second our fingers touch, Billie goes down. It didn’t look right at all, because her head was down and she was smashed against the barricade. I try to pull her arm up and I feel a pull on me, so I turn around and it’s this guy. And instantly, something clicked. It was immediate. All I thought was, “You just put your hands on this little lady? Now it’s me and you.” What did you do? All I saw was his face and I just started rushing him. I was screaming and honestly, it was a lot of cussing. “What are you doing? What are you doing? Don’t mess with Billie! Get him out of here!” And then next thing I remember, what felt like six police officers were on top of him. I don’t even remember the police kind of grabbing me as well, but they were actually really nice and ended up being on my side. Were you able to enjoy the concert after the incident? After the security guards questioned me, and they were very nice, I went to my spot by the barricade. Everyone there was so nice. They kept my purse for me. They were asking if I was OK. They’re the sweetest people ever. I love them forever. But I was so angry I couldn’t really just enjoy the moment. Like, in all my concert videos after that, you can hear me screaming “I can’t even believe this happened! This is insane!” By the end of the concert, everyone was smiling, filling their hands with confetti, and because I went by myself, I was just walking around the arena solo trying to find the exit, just yelling “I can’t believe that!” to myself. I know I looked insane. Did you expect the incident to go as viral as it did? No, I was still very heated, so I didn’t even go on social media. The first thing I did was call my aunt, and tell her this guy just attacked Billie and that I rushed him. I thought I was really the only one with the video. I called my mom and she was immediately like, “No more solo concerts. That’s a grown man. You could have gotten hurt.” I did see one video about it by the end of the night, but I thought it would be gone by morning. So I go to sleep and when I wake up, I have 2,000 new followers on TikTok. Were you concerned when you realized just how viral the clips were getting, especially the ones focused on you? So when I first saw the video on Twitter, I gasped. I was like, “Oh, my goodness, all people are going to see is an angry Black woman. Many Black women before me dealt with showcasing their emotions to disrespect, even if you’re trying to defend someone that you care about. So I was really worried that I would be taken out of context and treated like that. But I’m glad that people understood, and I’m very thankful for the opportunity to be seen as justified, because a lot of women did not get that same grace. How do you think fandom and obsession plays a part in incidents like this? That connection with stan and artist, your favorite artists — you care so deeply about them. And they care about all of the people that support them, too. I’m a woman. Billie is a woman. And it felt like this man just abused his power. Billie even has a song that is about that. So to forcefully grab her for no reason, just to be aggressive, you’re just out of your mind. But I feel like I would have done the same for anybody in that pit. I don’t play about putting hands on people and overstepping boundaries. It was just so disrespectful. I couldn’t fathom how that all went down so it led to so much anger in me. I’ve never ran up on nobody before. Yes, you could call me confrontational with my words, but it was just something about that situation. I had to do something. And I see a lot of comments like, “You saved Billie. You saved Billie.” Well, Mr. Police and Mr. Security — they saved Billie. But I was definitely going to give that man a piece of my mind. As someone who identifies as a stan, do you think concert etiquette like this has gotten worse because of parasocial relationships? One thousand percent. People see artists in the industry and think, “You owe me.” And I’m even guilty of this. When I first started getting into music I’m like, “Oh, my gosh, if I see them I’ll run up and ask for a picture, give them a hug.” It’s because I know them, but they’re looking at me and being nice but I’m a stranger. It’s reached a certain level of creepy, like, now people are crossing boundaries. It’s getting weird. It’s getting invasive. And I think it’s really important to keep understanding that you are strangers to your favorite artists. Yes, you have that relationship through their music, but you don’t know them personally. Yes, you watch them on live, yes, you watch all their interviews, and yes, you know every song, but you don’t know anything about that person. I think that’s something people really need to understand. Do you think stans are aware of when this kind of love and obsession gets disrespectful? I think so. I like to call them real stans, people who respect those boundaries. It’s the people who aren’t googling into their business and trying to find out what’s going on in their personal life. When headlines come out about Billie — that’s none of my business.  Something I keep in mind is Billie saying something along the lines of she wishes she could tell us everything, but then it would be all over the internet. If it was only Billie stans and my girl, we’d have so much fun. But I understand that when she disappears for months, I just know my girl is probably vibing because she needed that space. And I tell myself that she’ll come back again. She always does.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/billie-eilish-red-bandana-girl-viral-fan-1235447895,Entertainment,the guardians,CT Jones,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aniyah-billie-concert.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-15T17:59:59+00:00,eb496c6d96a7c087519bba3b9c34503b81077c80
b54f059fdadf,"‘Theatre is an elitist artform for privileged people’: Daniel Day-Lewis talks class, cinema and his crush on Mary Poppins",,"The actor Daniel Day-Lewis railed against audiences being priced out of theatres, and what he perceived as a continued snobbery concerning cinema in the UK at an event at the London film festival. Speaking to the critic Mark Kermode for a lengthy conversation in front of an audience at the BFI Southbank, Day-Lewis said he felt “there’s still an elitism in this country that theatre is the superior form”. His drama training at the Bristol Old Vic school had encouraged in him the sense that theatre work was the goal. “Then there’s films: bit dodgy. Television: like, really? OK, you gotta pay the gas bill. That was the thinking. “There was no concession [in the training] to movies at all. But secretly, most of us [students] longed to make movies, because we’d been raised on movies, and movies seemed just so wonderful to us and magical. “Not that the theatre isn’t too, but the theatre in itself is an elite cultural form. There are of course exceptions, many wonderful theatre companies that manage to put on affordable performances for everybody. But the great thing about the cinema is that everyone could – maybe not so much these days – but everyone could buy a ticket. Judi Dench and Daniel Day-Lewis onstage in Hamlet (1989) Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian “Theatre essentially relies on people having had the privilege of an education that allows them to believe that they’re entitled to go to the theatre. And that education has enabled them to understand perhaps the classics in a way that they make sense to them. It’s a relatively small group of people that is available to, and that is just quite wrong. It always bugged the hell out of me, much as I loved my time in the theatre, that we were essentially performing to a group of more or less privileged people.” On Tuesday night, Day-Lewis attended the UK premiere of his new film, Anemone , which as well as starring in, he has co-written with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis – who directs. The film is the three-time Oscar winner’s first movie in seven years, after his withdrawal from the profession in 2017. Following the release of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread, representatives for Day-Lewis released a statement saying he “will no longer be working as an actor … This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.” Speaking to Rolling Stone last month, however, Day-Lewis declared that he “never intended to retire” and “would have done well to just keep [his] mouth shut”. During the conversation in London on Wednesday, the actor again rejected what he perceived as misconceptions about method acting, saying that “recent commentary” about the technique for which he is famed “is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves. It’s almost as if it’s some specious science that we’re involved in or a cult.” “It is very easy to describe what I do as if I’m out of my mind and plenty of people have been happy to do that,” he said, adding that people often believed he was “mad as a March hare.” Rather, he said, method acting is “just a way of freeing yourself” in order to be spontaneous and “able to accept whatever passes through you” as another person. As an example, he cited one of Anemone’s key monologues, in which recounts to his brother (played by Sean Bean) how he exacted revenge on a clergyman who had abused him as a boy, with the help of Guinness, curry and a box of laxatives. “I don’t know why I found it so funny,” he said. “The idea of shitting on a priest. It’s not normal. But I just thought it was it hilarious and couldn’t stop laughing.” Day-Lewis as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, 1989. Photograph: Palace Films/Sportsphoto/Allstar He also discussed the role for which he won his first Oscar: the artist Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, in Jim Sheridan’s My Left Foot. The sea-change in attitudes toward the portrayal of people with disabilities in the 36 years since that film was shot meant he would no longer be cast in the role, said Day-Lewis. “Quite obviously, I would not be able to make that now, and for good reason – at the time it was already questionable,” he said, adding that “a couple of the kids that helped me so much at the Sandymount Clinic [for people with cerebral palsy] made it clear to me that they didn’t think I should be doing it.” The actor prepared by spending two months in a house with a wheelchair and a set of paints. “If you’ve got the responsibility of portraying a life like Christy Brown – a huge and noble figure in Irish society – then you should to try to understand as far as you are humanly able what it feels like to be inside of that experience. And I thought: ‘I’m never not gonna work like this again.’” Day-Lewis reflected that before making My Left Foot he had been “clueless” about moviemaking. “I didn’t have a fucking clue what I was doing,” he said, recalling the exasperation of director Stephen Frears on the set of My Beautiful Laundrette when shooting a scene in which his character is cleaning the shop. “There’s something like a compulsive need to find something that feels real to me,” he said. “So I’m mopping the floor and he says: ‘Just keep doing that.’ I said: ‘That bit’s clean.’ Stephen is a very clever man but he has very low tolerance. So he sent me to the cutting room with the editor and I’m looking at [the footage] and I go: ‘Oh, I see. Right. Because you need to be in the frame … ’ I was that stupid.” Day-Lewis and Rebecca Miller in 2005. Photograph: Andrea Comas/REUTERS Day-Lewis, who also won best actor Oscars for 2007’s There Will Be Blood and 2012’s Lincoln, also discussed working with his wife, the writer-director Rebecca Miller, on 2005’s The Ballad of Jack and Rose. She had sent him the script 15 years earlier, he said, before they had met. “I was very fond of her mum [photographer Inge Morath] and dad [the playwright Arthur Miller] and I got to know them and would go and stay with them in the house that Rebecca grew up in. So I heard a lot about her. And she sounded all right.” Working with their son, Ronan, 27, on Anemone was a similarly happy experience, he said, propped up by a generous director with time for everyone. “You can’t guarantee you’re gonna get a great film out of it, but what you will get is an experience that people will always remember happily. That was true of Jack and Rose, and it was true of Anemone.” The film, set in the late 1980s, is about two brothers, Ray (Day-Lewis) and Jem (Bean), who both served as British paramilitaries in Northern Ireland years before. Day-Lewis said that while some of his previous films, including In the Name of the Father and The Boxer, had looked at the debate from the perspective of West Belfast Catholics, there was a sense in which it was “not really cool to show the British military experience because they were the bad guys when in that situation. “But that’s not how it was. It was like anywhere in any conflict. There were young working-class people pitched against each other usually for no good reason. It was a dirty, dirty conflict. And I’d only really examined it from one point of view.” Daniel Day-Lewis with his son, Ronan. Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images for BFI Anemone has met with mixed notices, with critics praising Day-Lewis’s performance and the film’s stylistic ambition, but less certain on whether it adds up to a coherent piece of cinema. The film’s reception did bother him, said Day-Lewis. “You sort of try and wear a cap of defiance but it doesn’t fit that well. ‘We made this film we were happy making, it is what it is, we did what we could, we did our best etc.’ And of course it matters hugely to us. “The critics to some extent do have the power to either encourage people to see it or discourage them from seeing it. They’re the middlemen and women between us and the public. But what of course we yearn for is that when our job is done, that it will be meaningful to people. And if it proves not to be, it’s a very, very bad feeling. It’ll bring you right down.” But both he and his son cautioned against attempting to cater to public taste. “If you are trying to second-guess what people will think and how they’ll react,” said Day-Lewis, shaking his head. “There’s an epidemic proportion disease in cinema of that: trying to figure out how to get the audience to laugh, get them to cry, get them to whoop and cheer.” Gordon Warnecke and Daniel Day-Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette, 1985. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Day-Lewis also recalled interactions with his own heroes of acting, including Marlon Brando, who once proposed working together, and Alec Guinness, who wrote to him with praise after the release of My Beautiful Laundrette. “That just meant the world to me.” He added that the most powerful screen performance he had ever seen was that of the first-time child actor David Bradley in Ken Loach’s Kes, saying “I didn’t know it was possible to do something like that. A young boy who’d never acted before. And it is true and a little bit demoralising that some of the great performances over the years are from people who have never trained.” Day-Lewis reminisced about his years spent attending Saturday morning picture club screenings in south London: “You’d see cartoons and then the Lone Ranger and then something in a spaceship and they’d give you a badge and it was just fantastic.” He also named Mary Poppins as one of the greatest films ever made, singling out its star for particular praise, saying: “What a doll. I had a crush on Julie Andrews.” Reflecting on his career, Day-Lewis said that while “proud of a few things, a lot of things I’d start from scratch”. But in retrospect he was relieved, he concluded, that he’d possessed the “certain steadiness” which enabled him to turn down many more projects than he took on. “I’ve done very little over the years, but I knew from an early age that I wouldn’t try to dance to somebody else’s beat.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/15/daniel-day-lewis-london-film-festival,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88129e794a999ce30d84dec2510f6bc0f8781e2/0_140_4449_3560/master/4449.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb09812ee75d83289cf96fd88cf47965",2025-10-15T17:26:51+00:00,b971e3a38a02be264ef73b1303881128e188d770
8a9063aca93e,"Trans people at risk of exclusion from many UK public spaces, rights expert says",,"Transgender people risk being excluded from many public spaces as a result of the recent UK supreme court judgment and must be protected from discrimination, a human rights expert has said. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, said he had concerns about the climate for transgender people in the UK after April’s supreme court ruling that the legal definition of a woman in the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex. Interim advice issued after the judgment by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in effect banned transgender people from using facilities according to their lived gender and allowed services to request birth certificates to ensure single-sex services were protected. Its formal guidance, understood to be similar, was submitted last month to Bridget Phillipson, the minister for women and equalities and also the education secretary, who must decide whether to accept it. In a letter to the respective chairs of the UK parliament’s joint committee on human rights and the women and equalities committee, O’Flaherty said there was a tendency in the UK to see the human rights of different groups as a “zero-sum game”. He added: “This has contributed to narratives which build on prejudice against trans people and portray upholding their human rights as a de facto threat to the rights of others. “Such a zero-sum approach risks certain inferences being drawn from the UK supreme court judgment that could lead to widespread exclusion of trans people from many public spaces. “This, in turn, may severely infringe on their ability to participate fully and equally in society. This is particularly the case, as discussions about how access to services and facilities will have to be regulated following the judgment have tended towards the exclusion of trans people.” O’Flaherty, who explored the situation of transgender people on a recent visit to the UK, said there should be clear guidance on how their exclusion could be minimised “to situations in which this would be strictly necessary and proportionate, in line with well-established human rights principles”. O’Flaherty said he was concerned that blanket practices or policies on access to gender-segregated spaces “would require trans people to habitually ‘out’ themselves publicly when accessing services or facilities, either directly (by being asked about their sex assigned at birth) or indirectly (by having to use services or facilities in such a way that it becomes apparent they are trans)”. Such forced or non-consensual disclosure fell within the right to private life under article 8 of the European convention of human rights , he said. “Beyond privacy concerns, being forced to disclose sex assigned at birth may also significantly increase people’s vulnerability to harassment, abuse and even violence,” he added. The supreme court case was brought by the gender-critical group For Women Scotland, which has criticised delays to new policies and guidance after the ruling. O’Flaherty said his letter “in no way detracts from the need to continue improving measures to prevent violence against women and girls, as well as the protection and promotion of women’s rights and gender equality more generally. I am concerned that a debate about violence against women, framed in a way that restricts the human rights and freedoms of trans people, risks undermining the comprehensive, evidence-based approach needed to address this epidemic.” A spokesperson for the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said: “We will always support single-sex spaces based on biological sex. Everyone deserves dignity and respect throughout society. But we’ve been very clear that we respect the outcome of the supreme court judgment and the clarity to the definition of women.” This article and its subheading were amended on 14 October 2025.

7ca0a40b7b9f,Ministry of Justice ‘has failed to file spending receipts of nearly £11bn’,,"The Ministry of Justice, the Whitehall department in charge of a £13bn annual budget for prisons, probation and courts across England and Wales, has failed to file spending receipts of nearly £11bn, a report has said. Tussell, the public spending analyst firm, said the government department was more than two years behind on publishing receipts for multimillion pound contracts, weakening scrutiny around public money. The last time the government department filed receipts from its suppliers was May 2023, Tussell said. The industry standard is to allow leeway of two months to publish receipts. A spokesperson for Tussell said: “This gap in publication is deeply concerning and highlights that the government is failing to meet its own transparency standards. “Such delays undermine visibility over public spending at a time when accountability and scrutiny are more critical than ever.” Between June 2022 and May 2023 – the most recent 12-month period for which the MoJ has published its receipts – the department’s spending receipts amounted to £5bn. Tussell has calculated the missing spending by dividing this figure by 12 and multiplying it by the number of months when the department has failed to file receipts, which is 26. The estimated total came to £10.8bn, Tussell said. This calculation includes all Ministry of Justice arm’s length bodies, except for the family court advisers Cafcass and the Legal Services Board, which are both more up to date in their publishing. Tom Brake, the director of the transparency organisation Unlock Democracy, condemned the MoJ’s failure to publish. “With government finances painfully tight, spending receipts must be published promptly,” he said. “They help detect and prevent the misuse and waste of precious resources. Delaying their publication damages the government’s ability to control its expenditure.” According to government-wide calculations, the Ministry of Justice is by far the worst performing department when it comes to missing spending data. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero is 13 months behind on disclosing its spending receipts, worth an estimated £3.7bn. The third-worst department is the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which has a 10-month lag on publication of spending estimated at £880m. The MoJ received a real-term 1.8% spending increase in June, according to the spending review announced by the chancellor. Day-to-day MoJ spending is set to reach £13.2bn by 2028-29, while capital spending will rise to £2.3bn annually for 2026-27 and 2028-29, before returning to £2bn in 2029-30. This will support the initiative to create 14,000 new prison places by 2031. The Institute for Fiscal Studies noted in February that MoJ spending was cut by 70% over the early 2010s and, within this, capital funding for HM Courts and Tribunals Service and HM Prison and Probation Service was cut by more than 90%. The government aims to create 14,000 additional prison places by 2031 by spending £4.7bn – with about 2,500 of these having already been built since July 2024. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that all spending had been accounted for. “We need to review a substantial amount of data to ensure we do not release anything that could cause any risk, particularly to individuals,” they said. “All departmental spend is accounted for in our annual accounts and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/ministry-of-justice-has-failed-to-file-spending-receipts-of-nearly-11bn,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54230434e438ab78ae11aa309fe70ef1cea4117/1000_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=146f0f5460a1772488e82e8018f65fd3",2025-10-15T23:01:49+00:00,1fb985e5156049c03dd22d5780c50740d153833c
5b42da76cfa5,No 10 moves to end China spy row – but threat of further fallout lingers,,"When Keir Starmer finally read the witness statement from his deputy national security adviser for the trial of two British men accused of spying for China, some of his frustration about the collapse of the case began to dissipate. His government had been besieged by the Tories for two weeks over its role, being accused of “secretly sabotaging” the trial, “blocking” key witnesses and “hiding behind process”, all to avoid having to tell a court that China was an enemy. Media reports suggested the refusal by the government to describe China as a threat had scuppered the case, eventually forcing it to publish three witness statements from Matthew Collins, the government’s deputy national security adviser – one produced under Rishi Sunak’s government and two under Starmer’s. The statements presented a generally consistent picture of China as – in the words of the first, from December 2023 – an “epoch-defining challenge”. The final statement said the UK wanted a “positive relationship” with China and would follow a “three Cs” approach – cooperation, competition, but also “challenge where we must, including on issues of national security”. Yet this was submitted in August, and – despite No 10 suggesting any evidence would only refer to the government’s position at the time of the alleged spying – the “three Cs” approach was clearly Labour policy. Just 24 hours earlier, Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, decided not to release the witness statement because prosecutors had argued it would be inappropriate to do so outside a courtroom. Yet by Tuesday evening the Crown Prosecution Service had changed its mind. Now senior government figures are hopeful the evidence will help to draw a line under what is a complex legal controversy, and one which they argue could have been avoided had the Tories fixed flaws in the Official Secrets Act when in power. Downing Street is attempting to turn the tables, accusing Kemi Badenoch of “overreach”. One insider said: “Far from this being the fault of the Labour party, the main evidence was provided under the Conservatives in 2023.” Kemi Badenoch. Downing Street is attempting to turn the tables on Tory criticism, accusing Kemi Badenoch of ‘overreach’. Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA “Now the question is for the Tories: did they have access to the evidence at the time?” The answer is “yes”, according to sources in Rishi Sunak’s No 10 operation. Much has been made by the Tories of a meeting between national security adviser Jonathan Powell and Olly Robbins, the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, on 1 September this year. Yet the third and final piece of evidence from Collins was submitted weeks earlier and – crucially – the CPS had made no further requests for evidence to support their case before abandoning it. Downing Street sources say the meeting was held to discuss broader bilateral issues, including how the government should handle the trial which, at that point, was going ahead. “Unless Jonathan Powell had a time machine, he couldn’t have known that it was going to collapse,” one said. They insist they didn’t get into the evidence. Starmer was first told the case was in danger of collapsing a couple of days before it actually did on 15 September, his spokesperson has confirmed. Sources maintain it would have been inappropriate for the prime minister to intervene in a legal process. The Guardian also understands that Collins was told by the CPS that once charges had been laid, he couldn’t share his evidence further. The Tories, however, have suggested that given the allegations involved spying on MPs, special circumstances should have applied. On social media, Badenoch accused Starmer of being “too weak” to stand up for national security, a criticism flatly rejected by No 10. But what of the CPS? Legal experts are generally divided in their response to the collapsed trial. Many – including some government lawyers – believe the reliance on the term “enemy” in the Official Secrets Act meant there was never any chance of a successful prosecution. Others feel that given the precedent set by previous espionage cases and Collins’ evidence, prosecutors should just have cracked on. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, also faces questions after he told some of parliament’s most senior MPs on Wednesday night that the CPS dropped the case as the evidence provided by Collins was “5% less” than the threshold required for prosecution. He will now face calls to make crystal clear exactly how it fell short, especially as Collins repeatedly referred to China as a “threat”. While Starmer, as a former director of prosecutions, is in his comfort zone when it comes to the law, there are regular rumblings on his own side about whether he is able to spot political landmines. Despite that, his team are hoping he has dodged this particular trap. And yet questions remain. Could Collins have offered more evidence within the constraints of the Official Secrets Act? What did the attorney general do when told by Parkinson the spying case was on the brink of collapse? Is there more that Starmer could have done? In the Commons, former security minister Tom Tugendhat, asked Starmer: “The real question is, what political direction did this government give to their officials before they went to give evidence?” “Absolutely none,” he replied. “I was the chief prosecutor for five years, and I can say … not once was I subjected to political pressure of any sort from anyone. That is the tradition in this country; it is a proud tradition; it is one I uphold as prime minister.” Yet if any evidence should emerge to the contrary – especially given the third piece of evidence appears to reflect Labour party policy – then the domestic political fallout from the China spy trial will be very far from over.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/no-10-moves-to-end-china-spy-row-but-threat-of-further-fallout-lingers,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb7daca9d878c671d46887912492ea900e4d3ad/1542_661_5087_4071/master/5087.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89e2beb61e33a006a2a014cdcfc93b19",2025-10-15T23:00:20+00:00,ac9f7ec617d3908c1e9fcd0f5b63cd064b7f9661

Just by sitting down outside for 20 minutes, wherever you are, you can help build a national picture of the prevalence and variety of birdlife around Australia. Head over to the Aussie Bird Count website to find all the details on how to register and take part. Share Updated at 22.53 EDT Tawny facts! The Latin name for tawny frogmouths is Podargus strigoides , though as tawny expert Gisela Kaplan explains in her book (which I highly recommend reading), it is a rather unfairly negative name: ‘Podargus’ is the Latin term for a ‘gouty old man’ and that, presumably, refers to their short legs and their hobbling, shuffling walk. ‘Strigoides’, meaning ‘owl-like’, is a little more scientific. Despite being nocturnal, tawnies, of course, are not owls (although definitely mistaken for them, as the name suggests). Frogmouths are considered their own family of birds these days, but are in any event more closely related to nightjars. Like so many of us, I have a very soft spot for tawny frogmouths and have come to know a local family of them very well, as I wrote about here: Here’s how the rankings broke down in the final vote: Tawny frogmouth Baudin’s black cockatoo Gang-gang cockatoo Willie wagtail Bush stone-curlew Laughing kookaburra Southern emu-wren Spotted pardalote Wedge-tailed eagle Little penguin Tawny Frogmouth.

More than 310,000 votes were cast after polling opened on 6 October and the tawny led the charge from the start, despite being hotly and persistently pursued by two cockatoos: the Baudin’s black cockatoo and the ever-popular gang-gang. A tawny frogmouth win, however, was far from guaranteed. It was voted runner-up in 2019, 2021 and 2023. It also led the vote in the final stages of the 2023 competition, only to watch the swift parrot soar past on the final day. This year, 11,851 votes were cast for the tawny in the final round, comprehensively awarding it first place ahead of the Baudin’s black cockatoo, which came in second with 7,688 votes, and the gang-gang, coming in third for the third time, with 6,256 votes.

Once persecution stops, these seriously impressive beasts start to make a comeback. Reader Alex from NSW explained what makes them so great: The wedge-tailed eagle is majestic and wise.

They feed quietly on eucalypt leaves but nest in tunnels they excavate to escape larger, more aggressive species. They have a sweet but surprisingly loud call that some think sounds as though they’re saying “Miss Piggy”.

What does this adorable and charismatic muppet have to do to get over the line? Quite common across Australia, it relies on looking like a lump of dead wood to avoid detection during the day. But enough people have noticed it for researchers to nominate it the world’s most Instagrammable bird. Sallym , Sydney, put it simply in her nomination: Look at it, it’s awesome! This year, there really has been a sense that it might be tawny time – perhaps encapsulated best by this Instagram account, Justice for Frogmouths , that appeared just as the poll kicked off.

5575aae1434e,Tawny frogmouth named 2025 Australian bird of the year winner,,"The tawny frogmouth has been named Australia’s 2025 bird of the year, after taking second place in the biennial Guardian/BirdLife Australia poll three times running. More than 310,000 votes were cast after polling opened on 6 October and the tawny led the charge from the start, despite being hotly and persistently pursued by two cockatoos: the Baudin’s black cockatoo and the ever-popular gang-gang.

This year, 11,851 votes were cast for the tawny in the final round, comprehensively awarding it first place ahead of the Baudin’s black cockatoo, which came in second with 7,688 votes. The gang-gang cockatoo, a red-crested Canberra favourite with a call that sounds like a rusty hinge, took third place – as it did in 2021 and 2023 – with 6,256 votes. In fourth place was the willie wagtail with 4,947 votes. The bush stone-curlew came in fifth with 4,370 votes, pushing the laughing kookaburra to sixth place by a margin of just nine votes (4,361). Tawny frogmouths are found only in Australia, but can be seen in almost any habitat apart from dense rainforests, alpine moors and treeless deserts. They are nocturnal, territorial and mate for life, nesting (haphazardly) on large horizontal branches of older trees. Tawnies and other frogmouths, so-named for their flat gaping bills, are often mistaken for owls but are more closely related to nightjars. Their mottled silvery-grey and russet plumage resembles tree bark, making them challenging to spot, despite their prevalence across the country, including in cities. Camouflage abilities notwithstanding, a German study in 2021 found tawny frogmouths to be the world’s most Instagrammable bird . Sean Dooley from Birdlife Australia said the public response to this year’s poll had been “really joyful”. “It’s a delight to be involved in something that feels celebratory and fun, and perhaps a little silly … it reminds people about how wonderful our bird life is, but how precarious so many of our species are,” Dooley said. “Bringing attention to something like the rocket launch site being constructed on a really vital piece of habitat for the Eyre peninsula southern emu-wren, or talking about how the expansion of bauxite mining leases in the jarrah forests around Perth is just going be a brutal blow to the beautiful Baudin’s black cockatoo is really important.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Clear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The little penguin was not far behind in tenth place, with 3,268 votes. A first-time entrant, the Baudin’s black cockatoo is found only in south-western Western Australia, between Albany and Perth. Researchers have argued the species ought to be classified as critically endangered, as the population is steeply declining due to the continuing deforestation, but the WA government has so far not reclassified it. “We know that Australia’s birds are facing an extinction crisis. The rarer things get, the more impact one-off events have,” Dooley said.

1a9c45d51c61,NSW anti-protest law ruled unconstitutional after Palestine Action Group court challenge,,"The New South Wales supreme court has struck down a law that had given police expanded powers to prevent protests near places of worship. Josh Lees, on behalf of the Palestine Action Group, had challenged the law on the basis that it was unconstitutional. Justice Anna Mitchelmore ruled on Thursday that the police powers impermissibly burdened the freedom of political communication implied in Australia’s constitution. The challenge came after the NSW government in February made changes aimed at curbing antisemitism. This included a law which gave police the power to move on protesters who were “in or near” a place of worship. Sign up: AU Breaking News email It raised fears that the broad powers could see police shut down protests at major sites in Sydney , including Town Hall and Hyde Park, which are near places of worship. The move-on powers did not stipulate that the protest needed to be directed at the place of worship – it could be about anything. During the hearing in June, lawyers for the Palestine Action Group argued the “vagueness” of the legislation’s wording created a “chilling effect” as neither protesters nor police officers could determine the reach of the powers. The state of NSW had argued that the laws had an “obvious and legitimate purpose” of protecting religious communities trying to access a place of worship from physical obstruction, physical or verbal harassment, intimidation or incitement to fear. Appearing for the state of NSW, Michael Sexton SC told the court the “in or near” wording was confined to those instances. However, Mitchelmore said in her judgment that she did not accept that submission by the state. “[The law] is directed at protest activity, removing a limitation on police giving directions in relation to an apparently genuine demonstration or protest,” she wrote. “Protests and procession routes in areas of civic significance will likely place protestors in close physical proximity to places of worship, and the marginal burden imposed by [the law] goes further than the constitutionally valid baseline in a meaningful way.” Catalyst for the bill The court heard the catalyst for the places of worship bill was a protest outside the Great Synagogue where a member of the Israel Defense Forces was speaking. “[It] was not a religious event,” PAG’s barrister, Felicity Graham, had told the court. Lees told reporters after the judgment was delivered: “The Palestinian group has not organised a single protest targeting a place of worship. “These laws were about targeting anyone who protested near a place of worship, even if it had nothing to do with that place of worship.” After the judgment was handed down, NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson said the premier, Chris Minns , should have heeded the calls from members of his own party. “When governments create moral panics, they make grave mistakes and they do go too far,” she said. During a February debate over the bill, Labor MP Stephen Lawrence told parliament that the synagogue protest being the catalyst showed the “clear intention of the bill” was not what the government claimed. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For more information about how we use your data see our Privacy Policy . We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. after newsletter promotion Guardian Australia understands that the law caused friction during an internal Labor meeting after it was introduced. During that meeting, Labor MP Anthony D’Adam moved a motion to redraft the bill so that the obstruction was limited to instances where a protest was directed at a place of worship. Both Lawrence and another Labor MP, Cameron Murphy, had warned that without this limitation, the law could be found unconstitutional. Minns said in March that the government believed the laws were “constitutionally sound”. D’Adam told parliament in February that the synagogue event “was put on by the Israel Institute of Technology and celebrated 100 years of that organisation”. The Labor MP’s comments weren’t referred to in the supreme court, but D’Adam said at the time: “It was platforming a recently returned Israel Defense Forces member who was going to share their experiences of being on duty, presumably involved in the conflict in Gaza.” On Thursday, after the judgment, Minns said the government would take time to consider the ruling. “These laws were designed to strike the right balance between community protection and the freedom of political expression,” he said. The premier noted the decision had no impact on the section of the law making it a crime to impede, harass, intimidate or threaten a person accessing a place of worship without a reasonable excuse. That offence carried a maximum of two years in prison. Police were given associated move-on powers, which is the section PAG challenged. The laws were part of changes passed in February after a wave of antisemitic attacks over the summer, which included a caravan being found laden with explosives on the outskirts of Sydney. Two weeks after the legislation was passed, the Australian federal police revealed their belief that the caravan and antisemitic attacks were a “con job” by organised crime to divert police resources and influence prosecutions. The revelation triggered an upper house inquiry into what Minns and his senior cabinet ministers knew about the attacks before passing the legislation. The inquiry, which was supported by the Coalition, the Greens and members of the crossbench, is yet to hand down its findings. Last week, it was revealed that NSW police had wrongly categorised a “significant” number of incidents as antisemitic, including anti-Palestinian graffiti and verbal abuse directed at pro- Palestine protesters. In March, as Minns came under fire for the legal changes, he cited an incorrect figure and referred to the incidents as attacks, telling the ABC: “There have been 700 instances of antisemitic attacks over the summer”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/nsw-anti-protest-laws-ruled-unconstitutional-after-palestine-action-group-court-challenge,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eddd284cb72a0d3d3b71e9fcda337f199654b9ee/313_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c95571f82b128ddf83e3ceec7554ef0",2025-10-16T00:20:57+00:00,3f88dd42e0ed60255c403a07a4871b14473539fb
f322a1190e59,Border security officers sent to Balkans to disrupt people-smuggling networks,,"British border security officers have been deployed to the Balkans for the first time in an effort to disrupt the networks smuggling migrants into the UK. Officers have been sent to develop new ways of working with Frontex, the EU’s border agency, to track down and arrest people-smugglers operating along key routes into western Europe . As part of the initiative, UK officers are training border guards across the western Balkans to use British-made drones and biometric tracking systems to track migrants. Officials are also sharing techniques for detecting visa and passport fraud to block migrants before they reach the Channel. Shabana Mahmood this week hosted her counterparts from the western Balkans and other European countries at a London summit aimed at bolstering cooperation on tackling illegal migration. The home secretary said: “I have instructed UK law enforcement to explore all options including deploying operations in the west Balkans to tackle illegal migration routes. “I have pledged to do whatever it takes to secure our borders. That is exactly what I am doing.” About 22,000 people were smuggled through the western Balkans by organised gangs last year, according to the Home Office. Frontex data shows irregular crossings on the route fell by 78% in 2024, though UK officials say it continues to serve as a major transit route for both migrant smuggling and cross-border drug trafficking. The UK and Frontex signed a formal working arrangement in February 2024 to strengthen cooperation on intelligence sharing, joint operations, training and technical support. The UK border security commander, Martin Hewitt, said Britain would provide drones and night-vision goggles to support police forces in the region in dismantling smuggling operations. He made the announcement after chairing the Balkans Border Police Chiefs’ Forum in Sarajevo last week. Since July 2024, the UK government has entered into several joint operational agreements with Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia specifically aimed at disrupting organised crime groups operating across the western Balkans. Next week, Keir Starmer is expected to host a leaders’ summit with western Balkan nations to agree further measures to reduce the number of people entering the UK illegally.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/16/border-security-officers-sent-to-balkans-to-disrupt-people-smuggling-networks,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dbd98e9de5047b344854898a2c32738293c73c9/99_0_4561_3649/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c3e9d6f482ae5c3baa44ad829130218",2025-10-15T23:05:40+00:00,ac28b425453073c6f2a11b3e54228c522b33114a
239d3d7530cf,Hamas says all reachable hostage bodies recovered amid Israel threat to resume Gaza fighting,,"Hamas has announced that the remains of all the deceased Israeli hostages that it can reach have been handed back and it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from Gaza’s ruins, amid threats from Israel to resume fighting if the terms of ceasefire are not honoured. Two further bodies were handed over late on Wednesday , after Hamas had already returned the remains of seven of 28 known deceased hostages – along with an eighth body which Israel said was not that of a former hostage. Soon after, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement on social media that the group had “fulfilled its commitment to the agreement by handing over all living Israeli prisoners in its custody, as well as the corpses it could access … as for the remaining corpses, it requires extensive efforts and special equipment for their retrieval and extraction.” Since Monday, under a ceasefire agreement brokered by US president Donald Trump , Hamas has handed back 20 surviving hostages to Israel in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails. Israel’s defence minister threatened on Wednesday to resume fighting if Hamas does not honour the continuing terms of the deal. “If Hamas refuses to comply with the agreement, Israel, in coordination with the United States, will resume fighting and act to achieve a total defeat of Hamas, to change the reality in Gaza and achieve all the objectives of the war,” a statement from Israel Katz’s office said. Seeking to keep the pressure on Hamas, Trump said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” Trump was quoted as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm. After the threat from Katz, senior US advisers briefed the media late on Wednesday that Hamas was aiming to stick to its pledge to return the bodies of dead hostages. Trucks carrying food aid and fuel, accompanied by a United Nations team, pass through the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Wednesday. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images Retrieving the bodies from Gaza was difficult because it had been “pulverised,” the advisers said, adding “here was a lot of disappointment and outrage when only four bodies were returned, and they could have just said, you know, we’re moving on … But they returned bodies the next day and then the next day, as quickly as we give them intelligence.” The US and other mediators were looking at a program of rewards for people helping locate the bodies of dead hostages, he said. Turkey, one of the key mediators in the deal, was meanwhile in talks to provide experts on body retrieval to send to Gaza, the adviser added. Aid trucks rolled into Gaza on Wednesday and preparations resumed to open the main Rafah crossing on Thursday, but Israel has warned it could keep the crossing shut and reduce aid supplies if Hamas returned bodies too slowly. Underscoring the political challenges facing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu , far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an opponent of the ceasefire plan, said on X that the aid delivery was a “disgrace” and accused Hamas of lies over the return of hostages’ bodies. Aid agencies and the United Nations are calling for Israel to open more crossings to allow “thousands of trucks” to enter the devastated territory every day. Tom Fletcher, the UN’s most senior relief coordinator, called on Israel to facilitate the “massive surge of humanitarian aid – on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted”. “We need more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles. Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said. Israeli politician Itamar Ben-Gvir inside the Knesset on the day Donald Trump delivered remarks. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Reuters Aid agencies say thousands of tonnes of aid, including food and medical supplies, has been loaded on to trucks waiting in Egypt or stockpiled elsewhere in the region. It is the only border point that connects Gaza to the world without passing through Israel. Israel has repeatedly blocked aid from entering Gaza during the conflict, prompting accusations it has used starvation as a weapon of war . A famine was declared in parts of the territory in August. Humanitarian officials in Gaza City said on Wednesday assistance was desperately needed , with hundreds of thousands of people without clean water, food and other essentials and many more suffering greatly. The deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. Many of the 90 bodies returned by Israeli authorities so far showed signs of torture and execution , including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts. “Almost all of them had been blindfolded, and had been bound up and they had gunshots between the eyes.

The dispute over the return of bodies still has the potential to upset the ceasefire deal along with other major issues that are yet to be resolved.

b896c2c804c5,"Faulty engineering led to deadly Titan sub implosion, US investigators rule",,"The deadly implosion of a submersible traveling to the wreck of the Titanic was the result of faulty engineering, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced on Wednesday. The NTSB’s final report on the voyage that killed five people in June 2023 said that OceanGate, the private company that owned the Titan, did not adequately test its experimental submersible before the trip. The Washington state-based firm, which suspended operations after the catastrophic implosion, was unaware of the submersible’s true durability, the report said. The victims, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, died instantly in the North Atlantic during the descent to the remains of the Titanic. The implosion also killed French underwater explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, known as “Mr Titanic”; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood. The Titan’s defective engineering “resulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements”, the NTSB said. The safety board also said OceanGate had not followed standard guidance for emergency responses, and that the Titan could have been found sooner if it had. If the company had abided by expected protocols, it would have saved “time and resources”, the report said, while noting “rescue was not possible in this case”. The report was also critical of the culture at the company, quoting a former operations technician who had raised alarms about potential coast guard regulations prior to the implosion. That technician had questioned the company’s choice to call paying passengers “mission specialists”, prompting the CEO to respond that “if the Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away”, the report said, citing the technician. The NTSB report dovetails with a coast guard report released in August that described the Titan implosion as preventable. The coast guard determined that safety procedures at OceanGate were “critically flawed” and found “glaring disparities” between safety protocols and actual practices. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Wednesday. In August, after the coast guard report was released, a company spokesperson offered condolences to the families of those who died. The Titan’s implosion led to lawsuits and to calls for tighter regulation of private deep-sea expeditions. The NTSB report suggested current regulations for small passenger vessels such as the Titan were inadequate and had “enabled OceanGate’s operation of the Titan in an unsafe manner”. The safety board recommended the coast guard establish a panel of experts to study submersibles and implement updated regulations. The report also called on the coast guard to “disseminate findings of the study to the industry”, which has grown in recent years as privately financed exploration has grown. The vessel had been making voyages to the Titanic site since 2021. Its final dive came on the morning of 18 June 2023. The submersible lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later and was reported overdue that afternoon. A multiday search for survivors off Canada made international headlines. It soon became clear there would be no survivors, and the coast guard and other authorities began lengthy investigations into what had happened.

5208eea6eebe,"‘Gruesome videos’: social media pushes distressing news to children, experts say",,"More than half of children who get news from social media are left worried and upset after seeing content that involves war, violence and death, according to new research that found social media companies are “pushing” distressing news to children who are not seeking it. Videos of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the Liverpool parade car-ramming attack, scenes from wars, shootings, stabbings and car crashes have recently been pushed into children’s feeds, research by Internet Matters, an online safety organisation, has found. As a result, 39% of those who saw distressing content described themselves as very or extremely upset and worried by it. More than two-thirds of children are getting news from social media apps including TikTok and Instagram , but 40% do not follow news-focused accounts and are instead coming across stories through recommendation algorithms. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of those who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the past month. One 14-year-old girl told researchers: “On TikTok you can see stabbings and kidnappings, which are just not nice to see, especially when you are a bit younger, it makes you feel uncomfortable.” Another girl, 17, said: “On Instagram, before videos get taken down, I think there’s quite a lot of stabbing videos or gruesome videos like that. When Liam Payne died [the One Direction star fell from a hotel balcony] there was video of him circulating and I thought it wasn’t very nice. I would have wanted a trigger warning.” Of news that pops up in his feed, a 13-year-old boy said: “You don’t want to see it sometimes and don’t want to think about it.” The survey findings reflect a wider trend in social media use: the proportion of time users spend viewing content posted by their friends is falling on several platforms. Meta said in court filings this April that only 8% of an Instagram user’s time is now spent viewing friend posts, down by over a third since 2023, with algorithmically recommended posts instead increasingly dominating users’ feeds, contributing to the supposed phenomenon of “brain rot”. Research has found 61% of children who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the last month. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP The vast majority of children (86%) do not know how to reset the explore algorithm on their social accounts, which serves the upsetting material, according to the research which involved a survey and focus groups with more than 1,000 11- to 17-year-olds. “The shift away from established news channels is radically changing how children and young people consume news, and it is having worrying consequences,” said Rachel Huggins, co-chief executive of Internet Matters, which provides advice to parents and is part-supported by tech companies including TikTok. “The algorithmic design of social media platforms is enabling children to see negative and upsetting content [and it is delivering it] to millions of children and young people who are not seeking it out.” Chi Onwurah MP, the Labour chair of the commons science and technology committee, said the findings reinforced its conclusion that the Online Safety Act “isn’t up to scratch to protect users”. She called for a stronger regime “that discourages the viral spread of misinformation, regulates generative AI and places much-needed standards on to social media companies”. Under the Online Safety Act, codes to protect children require social media companies to give children age-appropriate access to content that depicts or encourages serious violence or injury. Younger children are seeing news relating to war and conflict, and violence and crime, less than older children but Internet Matters said: “It is still concerning that 11- to 12-year-olds are seeing this content at all given many social media platforms have a minimum age of 13+ outlined in their terms of service.” According to TikTok, human blood and extreme physical fighting cannot be included in its “for you” feed and the platform does not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing or extremely violent content. It said it uses independent factcheckers and allows parents to block their teens from using the app during times they control and to filter content.

0c7c1bc86929,"Some parents of special school pupils in England spending £5,000 on EHCPs",,"One in eight children in special schools have parents who spent £5,000 or more on their assessments, according to research that reveals huge inequalities in how parents navigate England’s special educational needs system. The research comes as the government is planning to overhaul special educational needs and disabilities (Send) provision in schools. Despite earlier reports that education, health and care plans (EHCPs) that detail support for each child would be scrapped as part of the overhaul, sources have told the Guardian that the plans will now survive the reforms. The report by the Sutton Trust found that 65% of working-class families interviewed spent nothing on their child’s EHCP application, while only 29% of middle-class families did the same. In contrast, one in 10 of the middle-class families interviewed had spent more than £5,000 on the application process, including medical assessments, consultants and legal advice. EHCPs were introduced in 2014, as a legal agreement between local authorities and parents for the additional support required based on a child’s needs. But the Sutton Trust report shows that parents able to spend thousands of pounds on their child’s applications were more likely to obtain sought-after special school places. The research found that 12% of parents with children in special schools had spent £5,000 or more on their EHCP application, compared with just 1% of those attending mainstream schools. Affluent parents were also more likely to contest local authority decisions at tribunals , the vast majority of which result in the successful award of an EHCP. Overall, middle-class parents were eight percentage points more likely to obtain an EHCP for their child than working-class parents. Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which campaigns for improving social mobility, said: “It’s unacceptable that a child’s background can dictate whether they get the help they need to thrive and be happy at school. This is a major barrier to their opportunities and can profoundly impact their long-term prospects. “Right now, disadvantaged kids with Send are being failed by a system beset with inconsistency and mind-boggling bureaucracy. Getting the right support for a child shouldn’t be about a parent’s ability to pay. We need urgent action to make the system work better for everyone.” Margaret Mulholland, the Association of School and College Leaders’ Send and inclusion specialist, said: “Schools and colleges work tirelessly to support these students but they are critically under-resourced and face wider problems of delays to assessments for EHCPs, and shortages of specialist staff such as speech and language therapists. “Desperate families often pay for assessments themselves and fight for the level of care they want for their child through tribunals. But such measures are often more difficult for disadvantaged families and this means that we effectively have a two-tier system.” The report found that children with special needs from poor backgrounds were “doubly disadvantaged”, likely to receive less support at school and end up with worse exam results than their better-off peers. While 26% of schoolchildren in England qualify for free school meals, they account for 44% of children with EHCPs, while a further 39% receive additional support without an EHCP. A Guardian investigation into the costs of Send found the highest-spending local authorities were concentrated in large, wealthy county areas in the south-east and east of England with higher prevalence of affluent parents. Of the 10 English councils with the largest accumulated Send deficits, four were in the wealthiest fifth of council areas and a further five in the wealthiest two-fifths. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Support should be based on children’s needs, not where in the country they happen to live, the ability of their parents to make the case, or whether or not they have an EHCP – which given shortages of funding and specialist staff is far from a silver bullet to ensure pupils get all the help they need.” Georgia Gould, the minister for school standards in England, said: “This report lays bare how badly children with Send have been let down and denied the opportunities and support they deserve. Our mission is to break down barriers to opportunity so every child, not just the privileged few, can achieve and thrive. “I’ve met parents who’ve had to fight every step of the way and we will not stand by whilst they continue to face a system that has failed them for far too long. That’s why we’re building a system with improved training for teachers, £740m to help create more specialist school places and earlier intervention for speech and language needs – reassuring parents that support will be available for, as routine at the earliest stage.”",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/16/some-parents-of-special-school-pupils-in-england-spending-5000-on-ehcps,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b84aa8138c74db6a8dd3f6e886354de905f4b3e/233_0_2535_2029/master/2535.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aadfca05f33cc7eead1cf3d9f0897821",2025-10-15T23:01:50+00:00,dbffa0d0281791c3b918fbb330863283dde1686b
dab11cdaddff,JD Vance brushes off racist texts by adults in Republican group chat as ‘what kids do’,,"JD Vance sought to downplay the revelation that leaders of a group called the Young Republicans exchanged hundreds of racist, sexist text messages – including one in which rape was called “epic”, and another in which someone wrote “I love Hitler” – as youthful indiscretions. Vance, speaking on a new episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, the podcast run by colleagues of the late conservative activist, suggested that the participants in the leaked chats were much younger than they in fact are. Some of the participants are barely younger than the 41-year-old vice-president. “The reality is that kids do stupid things, especially young boys,” Vance said. “They tell edgy, offensive jokes. That’s what kids do. And I really don’t want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke – telling a very offensive, stupid joke – is cause to ruin their lives.” Politico obtained months of exchanges from a Telegram conversation between leaders and members of the Young Republican National Federation and some of its affiliates in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont. Mother Jones reports that public records indicate that eight of the 11 Republican operatives who took part in the offensive chat appear to range in age from 24 to 35. The revelations have prompted bipartisan calls for those involved to be removed from or resign their positions. The Young Republican National Federation, the GOP’s political organization for Republicans between 18 and 40, called for those involved to step down from the organization. The group described the exchanges as “unbecoming of any Republican”. Vance, however, scolded Democrats and the media for paying too much attention to “what a bunch of young people, a bunch of kids, say in a group chat, however offensive”. He suggested that the racist texts from Republicans were a distraction from offensive texts sent by a Democratic candidate for attorney general of Virginia, Jay Jones, who joked that he would prefer to kill a Republican colleague than Hitler or Pol Pot. Jones has since said he has taken “full responsibility” for his comments and offered a public apology to Todd Gilbert, who then was speaker of Virginia’s house of delegates. Vance expressed irritation at people he said had allowed themselves to be distracted from the Democrat’s “incredible endorsement of political violence … by focusing on what kids are saying in a group chat”. “Grow up,” the vice-president said to those people concerned more about the racism in his party than the joking about violence in the other party. “I’m sorry, focus on the real issues, don’t focus on what kids say in group chats.” Vance said he grew up in a different era where “most of what I, the stupid things that I did as a teenager and as a young adult, they’re not on the internet”. The father of three said he would caution his own children, “especially my boys, don’t put things on the internet, like, be careful with what you post. If you put something in a group chat, assume that some scumbag is going to leak it in an effort to try to cause you harm or cause your family harm.” “I really don’t want to us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke, telling a very offensive, stupid joke is cause to ruin their lives,” Vance said. Other Republicans demanded more immediate intervention. Republican legislative leaders in Vermont, along with governor Phil Scott – also a Republican – called for the resignation of Sam Douglass, a state senator, revealed to be a participant in the chat. Saying she was “absolutely appalled to learn about the alleged comments made by leaders of the New York State Young Republicans”, congressperson Elise Stefanik of New York called for those involved to step down from their positions. Danedri Herbert, chair of the Kansas GOP, said the remarks “do not reflect the beliefs of Republicans and certainly not of Kansas Republicans at large”. Democrats have been more uniform in their condemnation. On Wednesday, California governor Gavin Newsom wrote to James Comer, the House oversight committee chair, asking for an investigation into the “vile and offensive text messages”, which he called “the definition of conduct that can create a hostile and discriminatory environment that violates civil rights laws”. Speaking on the Senate floor, the Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Tuesday described the chat as “revolting”, calling for Republicans including Trump and Vance to “condemn these comments swiftly and unequivocally”. Asked about the reporting, New York governor Kathy Hochul called the exchanges “vile” and called for consequences for those involved. “Kick them out of the party. Take away their official roles. Stop using them as campaign advisers,” Hochul said. “There needs to be consequences. This bullshit has to stop.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/jd-vance-racist-messages-young-republicans-chat-leak,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba14ce789d11563b177b42cf8e674da9b25edecd/790_435_1518_1215/master/1518.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d304ec172b426a29b30333d0ea2e10b7",2025-10-16T02:04:15+00:00,008eaf895b8b75286fbb9b86cf0aa4aee87192ce
30a26fc0613c,Brown University rejects Trump proposal to overhaul policies for preferential funding,,"Brown University has become the second higher-education institution to turn down an invitation from Donald Trump to sign onto his administration’s 10-page college compact that would overhaul university policies in return for preferential access to federal funding. The “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” is a proposed agreement that would impose restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and limits on international student enrollment. Brown’s move comes after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) refused to sign it last week. In a letter sent on Wednesday to administration officials, Brown’s president, Christina Paxson, said she was concerned that the compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance”. She added: “Additionally, a fundamental part of academic excellence is awarding research funding on the merits of the research being proposed. The cover letter describing the compact contemplates funding research on criteria other than the soundness and likely impact of research, which would ultimately damage the health and prosperity of Americans.” Her remarks mirror those of MIT’s president, Sally Kornbluth, who said the compact undermines merit-based processes for awarding research grants and signing it would “restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution” when she publicly declined the offer last week. Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), said in a statement: “By declining to compromise its core mission, Brown University has affirmed that no amount of federal inducement is worth surrendering the freedom to question, explore and dissent. In rejecting the compact, Brown stands as a bulwark for higher education’s sacred commitment to academic freedom and institutional self-governance.” The compact was first introduced to nine universities at the start of October. The remaining schools – the University of Virginia, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University and Dartmouth College – have not yet announced their decisions. Earlier this week, the Trump administration expanded the invitation to all US colleges and universities. Higher-education leaders and faculty have sharply criticized the proposal, describing it as a political attempt to undermine university autonomy. Trump has warned that institutions refusing to participate may face federal investigations into compliance with existing laws. However, it is still unclear whether research funding or student aid eligibility will depend on whether a school signs the agreement. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paxson said in her letter that the new compact would contradict assurances made in that earlier agreement, specifically a pledge that the administration would not interfere with the university’s curriculum or academic content. “We remain committed to the July agreement and its preservation of Brown’s core values in ways that the compact – in any form – fundamentally would not,” Paxson wrote.

7f3cf7682ffd,Trump takes credit for already dropping crime rates in press conference,,"Donald Trump held a press conference on Wednesday to take credit for decreases in violent crime that were already happening without his intervention. “I campaigned on crime, but I never thought we would go into every city and take a really safe city that we’ve all been living with for years and make it safe,” he said. “And now it’s a passion for me. I did get elected for crime, but I didn’t get elected for what we’re doing.” Trump, flanked by the FBI director, Kash Patel; the US attorney general, Pam Bondi; and the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, touted the federal takeover of policing in Washington DC and the amassing of arrests by federal agents in “Operation Summer Heat”. Operation Summer Heat, as described by Patel, was a three-month initiative to surge arrests of wanted fugitives across the country. The initiative is similar to seasonal surges by the US Marshals Service and other agencies in previous years, though its scope appears to be much broader. “As a result of these efforts, violent crime declined nearly 20% nationwide compared to the same period last year,” Trump said. “And it was the safest and most peaceful summer in the last two decades.” Crime began falling precipitously in major cities in 2022 and 2023. On the day Trump was inaugurated in January, crime had fallen to nearly 60-year lows. Nonetheless, the president has used the threat of crime in major cities as justification for extraordinary intervention by federal law enforcement personnel, including the deployment of national guard troops in Memphis , Tennessee, last week. “In a little while, you’re going to see some numbers that you’re not going to believe,” Trump said. I think you’re probably start with Memphis because I’m hearing the numbers are much quicker than we even thought possible.” Violent crime has been falling in Memphis for the last year. The Memphis police department released a note on 9 September – before the Memphis Safe Task Force of federal law enforcement agents and national guard personnel had been fully deployed – that overall crime there was at a 25-year low, with robbery, burglary and larceny also reaching 25-year lows. Murder is at a six-year low, aggravated assault at a five-year low and sexual assault at a 20-year low. Operation Summer Heat, an initiative to arrest violent criminals, as described by Patel, reflects “the best numbers for fighting crime in US history”. Patel offered arrests of 28,600 people over the first nine months of Trump’s presidency as evidence for the claim, with 8,700 arrests of “violent criminals” during the summer push, along with 2,200 firearms seized as well as 421kg of fentanyl – “enough to kill 55 million Americans, alone”, he claimed without providing a basis for that figure. Reporters present at the White House presentation did not ask Patel, Bondi or Trump about the quality of those arrests – that is, whether those arrests would hold up to historical conviction rates in which more than 99% of arrests result in a conviction. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She described that health scare as a “turning point”. “A turning point for me or a time when a switch was flicked was in the lead-up to the Paris Games, I went through some health challenges, which quite frankly really rocked me mentally. “It probably was the first time where I considered some things outside of swimming. “Delving more into those health challenges, I’ve really had to look within and think about what’s most important to me and beyond swimming, I’ve always had goals in my personal life, but swimming has always been most important up until this point and I’ve just realised that those goals and what I want in my future is now more important to me.” “But more than anything, I’m excited for what’s next.” Allow Instagram content?

At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Titmus achieved an historic third individual Olympic gold medal, winning the 400m freestyle in the race dubbed ‘the race of the century’ , where she defeated the other two previous world record-holders of this event – American all-time great Katie Ledecky and Canadian swimming prodigy Summer McIntosh. In doing so, Titmus became the first Australian athlete since Dawn Fraser in 1964 to win back-to-back gold medals in the same event. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Titmus credited Ledecky with pushing to become a champion athlete, naming her 2020 Tokyo Olympics, when she edged the 400m world record-holder, as her greatest achievement. “There’s nothing like the first, Tokyo going in as what was deemed the underdog, but I knew in myself I could win and to come from behind and win in Tokyo against the GOAT, that feeling will sit with me forever,” she said. “To win Olympic gold, it just didn’t have to be the best in the world I had to beat the greatest ever in the world and you know what, someone could look at that as a burden, but I absolutely looked at it as a blessing because I can say without a doubt, without facing Katie, I wouldn’t have been the athlete that I am.” Titmus, who was named Tasmania’s 2025 Young Australian of the Year, steps away from the sport as the current 200m world record-holder, having won a staggering haul of 33 international medals including eight Olympic medals (four gold, three silver and one bronze) and four world titles. She said she is hoping to work more in broadcasting and doing public speaking as well as giving back to swimming, particularly working with young athletes who are from regional areas.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/ariarne-titmus-announces-retirement-retires-swimming,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801de156065e18ce0571ef41cd27dfd5f48aa645/98_0_4830_3864/master/4830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5eb8ca6e7063df2056cf541ff570fce8",2025-10-15T22:56:23+00:00,1ff29abe94882d3f94e7f098b9a05b82de35ee8a
12166ae06434,Man Accused of Setting Devastating Pacific Palisades Fire Indicted By Federal Grand Jury,,"A federal grand jury indicted the 29-year-old man accused of starting a fire that eventually became the deadly Pacific Palisades wildfire that killed 12 people and destroyed large swaths of Los Angeles earlier this year. Jonathan Rinderknecht, who was arrested in Florida but previously lived in the Pacific Palisades, was charged with three counts related to the alleged arson, including arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, destruction of property by fire , and timber set afire, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. If convicted, Rinderknecht faces up to 45 years in prison, with a minimum sentence of five years. This original blaze that Rinderknecht allegedly started was known as the Lachman Fire, and it was quickly suppressed. But unbeknownst to firefighters and other authorities at the time, embers of the Lachman Fire continued to burn underground, and on Jan. 7, heavy winds caused the fire to surface and spread. The ensuing Palisades fire was one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history, destroying 23,400 acres of land and nearly 7,000 homes across the Pacific Palisades region. It caused an estimated $150 billion in damages. Rinderknecht was arrested earlier this month. According to an affidavit from an investigator for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Rinderknecht was working on New Year’s Eve as an Uber driver. While it’s unclear when exactly he allegedly set the fire, Rinderknecht allegedly drove to a Pacific Palisades trailhead, near where he used to live, and then walked to an area known as the Hidden Buddha clearing. The fire was first detected by the University of California at San Diego environmental sensing platforms about 12 minutes after midnight. Rinderknecht also allegedly tried to call 911 around the same time, but the call did not go through because of poor cell service. He attempted to make several more calls, and by the time he finally connected with the police, the fire had already been reported by others in the neighborhood. During his call with police, Rinderknecht also allegedly typed a question into ChatGPT: “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarette?” ChatGPT allegedly responded “Yes,” with an explanation. As Rinderknecht drove away, he allegedly passed firefighters on their way to tackle the fire. He later told investigators that he turned around and offered to help the firefighters, which the ATF agent characterized as “highly unusual conduct.” In the affidavit, the ATF agent noted that “arsonists sometimes like to watch firefighters respond to the fires that they have set.” The document also contains other potential evidence of Rinderknecht’s intentions, including several fire-related ChatGPT requests.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/pacific-palisades-fire-man-accused-of-setting-fire-indicted-1235448368,Entertainment,the guardians,Jodi Guglielmi,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-arrest.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-16T02:50:27+00:00,c132267955c02f2655d2c1fd8a79238fbd133887
9a6588fb203f,"Rachel Reeves should consider welfare cuts in budget, IFS says",,"Britain’s leading tax and spending experts have urged Rachel Reeves to consider announcing billions of pounds in welfare cuts in next month’s budget to help placate jittery financial markets. After the chancellor gave her strongest hint yet that spending cuts were under consideration , the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) called on Reeves to take “bold” action to plug a potential £22bn shortfall in the government finances. Warning the chancellor against “doing the bare minimum” to rebuild a financial buffer against her self-imposed fiscal rules, the thinktank said that she could be forced to look again at welfare savings alongside tax rises. The IFS said options could include scrapping the pensions triple lock, a fresh drive to cut health-related and disability benefits, and limiting growth in spending on special educational needs. However, such steps could reignite tensions with backbench Labour MPs after ministers were forced into an embarrassing U-turn earlier this year, following an attempt to push through billions of pounds in welfare savings. Ben Zaranko, an associate director at the IFS, said any changes would need to be presented as reforms which would improve outcomes for individuals. “Trying to do it to chase particular savings isn’t a recipe for success,” he said. In its annual “green budget” report, which analyses the public finances before Reeves’s speech to the Commons, the IFS said the chancellor could be forced to raise at least £22bn through a mixture of tax and spending measures. That would restore the £9.9bn of headroom Reeves had left herself at the March spring statement against her main fiscal rule, which requires day-to-day spending to be matched by revenues by the end of the parliament. The chancellor is expected to face a sharp downgrade from the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog, thanks to rising borrowing costs, weaker productivity forecasts, and welfare U-turns. However, the IFS argued there was a strong case for the chancellor to raise significantly more revenue to build a much larger buffer against to avoid the risk of “groundhog day” speculation in future over whether the rules are met. Helen Miller, the director of the IFS, said: “That wouldn’t be costless – but nor is limping from one forecast to the next under constant speculation that policy will be tightened again. Persistent uncertainty is damaging to the economic outlook.” In a report prepared alongside Barclays, the IFS said that any measures to raise revenue would need to be seen as “credible” with City investors to avoid rekindling speculation over Labour’s commitment to its fiscal rules. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moyeen Islam, a fixed income strategist at the bank, said: “Welfare is totemic. It’s totemic for the market because it shows a willingness to do hard things and burn a little bit of political capital … If you can’t do this with a 150 MP majority, or whatever it is, then when will you do this? “There would be an appreciation that she is willing to take hard choices. That to me is credibility bolstering or enhancing.” He said that City investors were fearful that Reeves would take a “Scrabble bag” approach to repairing the public finances, through a combination of small tax-raising measures. “[If] you cobble together a hodgepodge of measures and they’re not viewed as deliverable or credible, then you are entering into a more adverse market scenario,” he said. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “We won’t comment on speculation. The chancellor’s non-negotiable fiscal rules provide the stability needed to help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/16/rachel-reeves-should-consider-welfare-cuts-in-budget-ifs-says,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f18f5766fd18c44f9d2cbb073383ccfa7c8597/0_0_4619_3697/master/4619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2346787ddfc303c513c1c847ba8b075b",2025-10-16T05:00:58+00:00,c72eb0928ae164353cb92b6d409ccbf7d04f99f3
d56bb4ba4647,Agnes Wanjiru’s niece urges Labour to extradite ex-soldier while still in power,,"The niece of Agnes Wanjiru, who was killed in Kenya , said she hopes the former British soldier charged with her aunt’s murder will be extradited while the Labour government is still in power. On her first trip outside Kenya, Esther Njoki travelled to London, where she was invited to parliament to meet the defence secretary, John Healey, whom she urged not to delay the potentially years-long extradition process. “We are hoping that before his time ends and they get out of government he will have achieved what he wanted to achieve in Agnes’ case,” she said, “and it will be good for him, and also for [Wanjiru’s] family, and the whole world, because everyone is watching.” Njoki, 21, who acts as the spokesperson for Wanjiru’s family, added that she has noticed “a big change” in the approach from the UK since Labour came to power last year, and fears that progress in the case may stall under a different government. “Before it was it was very hard for us even to engage,” she said. “We even never got a chance to engage with the UK authorities, but now it is easy even to get to meet with the secretary of state for defence. We appreciate that, we don’t take it for granted.” Wanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser, disappeared after a night out in Nanyuki, Kenya in 2012. Her body was found several weeks later in the grounds of the hotel where she was last seen. Last month, a Kenyan court issued a warrant for the arrest of a suspect in the case, named as Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, who has been charged by a Kenyan court with a single count of murder. In order for the suspect to face charges in Kenya, an extradition request will first have to be received and authorised by the UK courts. “I’m hoping that whatever we discussed, it will be put into consideration, and things will be fast-tracked, because there’s the extradition process that is ahead,” Njoki said. “I believe … his hands are tied. He can’t do much because he might prejudice the criminal matter. But again, if there is political will, things might go faster. So we’re just hoping that things will be taken seriously and they’ll keep us updated as the family, and ensure that justice is served.” Healey, who had urged the previous government to act in Wanjiru’s case while in opposition, also met the family in Kenya in April, becoming the first UK government minister to do so. “We appreciate it, because it’s the second time, he’s a senior official. It’s hard to meet such people, so I appreciate the support that he always gives, and being willing to meet us and to listen to our grievances,” Njoki said. “We don’t take it for granted, and I appreciate him because we are seeing things changing, and then even he’s the first minister to meet us for over 13 years.” During her five-day visit, Njoki, who is studying communications at the University of Nairobi, gave media interviews to raise the profile of the case, and also appeared on a panel at the House of Commons. She sat alongside speakers including Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in international law and extradition, and Tessa Gregory, the UK lawyer acting for Wanjiru’s family. Njoki said she hoped her advocacy work would not only bring justice for her aunt, but improve the lives of women in Kenya. “This is a way of changing things, just small steps,” she said. “It’s a sign of hope that everything is possible. Despite where you come from, your background doesn’t have to define you.” Healey said: “Six months since our first meeting in Kenya, I was pleased to welcome the niece of the late Agnes Wanjiru, Esther Njoki, to London, to reiterate our government’s steadfast support for her family’s long and painful fight for justice. “I want to pay tribute to Esther, who is an extraordinary spokesperson for her family, and for women who have suffered violence.” He added: “We reflected on the significant progress made in recent months, with the case file being handed to the director of public prosecutions in April and a charging decision being made last month “Our government will continue to do everything we can to support the Kenyan investigation, secure a resolution to this case and finally bring peace to Esther and her grieving family.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/agnes-wanjiru-niece-urges-labour-extradite-ex-soldier-kenya,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d08201e7d7d59c50d15f76608f3a34e546dab7c/0_386_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb364bd3884b97bbab77f381b9b8cac3",2025-10-16T04:00:57+00:00,ca1b3729cfe3bb34226ef3e0310b6c1c59ff6ed7
a5c356680032,"Wage war on nature to build new homes: that’s Labour’s offer, but it’s a con trick",,"C rucial to the government’s war on nature is the “cauldron principle”. If a species is to be blamed for “holding up development”, it must be one you might find in a witch’s cauldron. The culprits are never dormice, otters, water voles, nightingales, turtle doves or orchids, widely considered cute or beautiful. They are bats, newts, snails and spiders. Bats and newts have been blamed by successive governments for nastily “standing in the way” of growth. In March, Keir Starmer claimed that “ jumping spiders ” had stopped “an entire new town”. He added: “I’ve not made that example up.” I think you can guess what comes next. The jumping spiders are among 200 rare invertebrate species living on the Swanscombe peninsula in Kent, officially protected for nature. It also harbours marsh harriers, bearded tits and several scarce plant species. It’s of tremendous importance to local people as a crucial green space. The nature reserve has done nothing to stop Ebbsfleet Garden City from going ahead. What developers were seeking to build on the peninsula was not homes, but a theme park . Boris Johnson’s government, hardly a staunch defender of nature against developers, declared the peninsula a site of special scientific interest , for its wide range of plants, geological features, birds and invertebrates. But Starmer, making it up as he goes along, has reduced the issue to spiders v people. Last week, the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, boasted to corporate executives that she has “ unblocked ” a large housing development in Sussex being held up by “some snails … a protected species or something … microscopic snails that you cannot even see”. This bring us to another principle: as the war on nature proceeds, ministers sound ever more like Donald Trump . The very rare little whirlpool ramshorn snail, by no means microscopic, is an indicator of fresh water not affected by sewage pollution: now a scarce habitat in England. Reeves went on to say: “We’ve got a good relationship with the developer and he brought it to our attention.” What is this relationship? I asked the Treasury, but it pointedly failed to answer the question. What the issue in Sussex is about is excessive water abstraction. The regulator, Natural England, warned that demand from the new development could cut off the water that keeps crucial and highly protected wetlands alive. Collapsing groundwater supplies also severely threaten human wellbeing in south-east England. It proposed that conditions should be met for the development to go ahead. Reeves appears to have swept the conditions away. But that doesn’t sound like such a noble cause as stomping on snails for the sake of people, does it? Ignorance and philistinism rule. By mentioning only the cauldron species, ministers hope to distance us from nature on behalf of property companies. Like Trump, they don’t even try to disguise their loyalties. Reeves boasted that she hatched the plan to rip down our nature protections over a “smoked salmon and scrambled eggs breakfast” with corporate lobbyists. Starmer told us that his resolve to kick down the planning rules is the result of his “ conversations with leading CEOs ”. The rare little whirlpool ramshorn snail. Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/Alamy The planning and infrastructure bill being rammed through parliament is a full-spectrum assault on nature protection, the worst in England in living memory. It was rushed out, without consultation or evidence, under an “ urgent measures ” procedure, a device usually reserved for a defence or public health emergency. In other words, the government has used another Trumpian gambit to get its way: emergency powers. The bill will enable developers to bulldoze precious wild places, as long as they pay into a fund that may create alternative habitats or green spaces somewhere else. Irreplaceble ecosystems will be sold for cash. This outrageous measure is even worse than it first appears: a closer reading of the bill shows that the money could be diverted into any form of government spending, from prisons to debt repayments. Alternatively, the payments could be used by Natural England to fund its administration and operations. You don’t need to be clairvoyant to see how that develops: as its funding is steadily privatised, the regulator comes to depend on developers for its survival. And it gets worse still. Clause 90 enables governments to use “Henry VIII powers” to change any act or law to meet the objectives of the bill without full parliamentary debate: another “emergency” measure that could threaten any remaining protections. Reform UK must be licking its lips. So why isn’t the country in uproar? Because the big nature groups – the RSPB, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trusts – with their combined membership of 7.5 million, are mute. They accepted a series of government amendments in return for agreeing not to campaign against the bill. They were well and truly conned: they thought the amendments met their demands, but they did no such thing . Now the government has published a truly horrifying set of new amendments to the bill, tearing down even more protections. Still, astonishingly, the big groups fail to stir: a striking contrast to the way they responded when Johnson and Liz Truss attempted similar assaults on nature. As Alexa Culver, a planning lawyer at RSK Wilding, and now the leading expert on the bill, remarks, “It’s an extraordinary capitulation.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Matters of Opinion Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we also need to defend and enhance our remaining ecosystems, and ensure everyone has access to green space, crucial to our physical and mental health. That’s what the planning system is for: to reconcile the need for development with other public needs.

fb0bb2051d3d,"Jim Bolger, former New Zealand prime minister who drove reconciliation with Māori, dies at 90",,"Former New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger, whose political legacy was defined by his deep commitment to reconciliation with Māori as well as his brutal cuts to welfare and deregulation of the labour market, has died aged 90. Bolger died peacefully surrounded by his wife, Joan, nine children and 18 grandchildren, his family said in a statement on Wednesday. Bolger suffered kidney failure last year and had been undergoing dialysis. A former National party leader, he served as prime minister from 1990 until 1997. Politicians from across the political spectrum paid tribute to Bolger after the news of his death, describing him as a man with high ideals, dogged determination and a great warmth for people. “To those who worked alongside him, he was a principled and formidable colleague,” said the prime minister, Christopher Luxon. “To his political opponents, he was a worthy adversary who never allowed disagreement to become personal.” Labour’s leader, Chris Hipkins , said Bolger was “humble, dedicated [and] passionate”, and pointed to his ability later in life to acknowledge growing inequality. “He could see that the concentration of wealth around the world was unsustainable, that the growing marginalisation of large segments of our society was leading to us becoming more divided and that we could not continue to stand for that.” Bolger entered parliament in 1972 and became leader of the National party in 1986 before becoming prime minister in 1990 when the party took power. He retired from politics in 1998 and served as New Zealand’s ambassador to the United States from 1998 to 2002. During his premiership, he oversaw the infamous 1991 “mother of all budgets”, delivered by his finance minister, Ruth Richardson, which severely cut spending on welfare and health. The budget was so unpopular it nearly cost his government the next election. Bolger pursued privatisation and oversaw the deregulation of the labour market that resulted in major declines in union membership. Bolger later disavowed neoliberalism, telling RNZ in 2017 it had failed to produce economic growth and “what growth there has been has gone to the few at the top”. During his time in government, Bolger ushered in the “mixed member proportional” electoral system that New Zealand still uses today. His legacy on treaty settlements – a system set up in 1975 to remedy the Crown’s breaches of the country’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi – will be long lasting. Bolger’s government concluded the first settlements between Māori tribes and the government – for the impact of colonisation. In his book A View From the Top, Bolger reflected on the settlement process. “Something within me – perhaps it is my Irish heritage, which is that of a nation oppressed for centuries – demanded that I listen to the Māori story, speak with those who wanted to talk about the grievances and determine in due course what could be done.” Tukoroirangi Morgan, chair of the Waikato Tainui iwi or tribe, said Bolger left a legacy in the settlement space that would remain unsurpassed. “Jim modernised the whole process of reconciliation in an effort to bring Aotearoa-New Zealand closer together to reflect a more contemporary reality of our nation,” he said. Green MP Teanu Tuiono said Bolger believed in the treaty, historical justice and the collective responsibility to honour the treaty. “When people questioned him on why treaty settlements, he said: ‘Because it is the right thing to do.’” Bolger was a committed republican and did not take a knighthood after he left politics. Instead he was made a member of New Zealand’s highest order, the Order of New Zealand.

102342ff23a3,US may take strategic stakes in rare earths companies to tackle China ‘power grab’,,"The Trump administration has criticised China’s increased restrictions on rare earth exports as a threat to global supply chains, and said it would seek to tighten control over strategic sectors by taking more stakes in key companies to counter Beijing. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told an event on Wednesday that China’s dramatic new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets demonstrated the need for the US to be self-sufficient in critical materials or rely more on trusted allies. He later characterised Beijing’s rare earth export curbs as “China versus the world,” vowing that Washington and its allies would “neither be commanded nor controlled.” “This should be a clear sign to our allies that we must work together, and work together we will,” Bessent told a press conference. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.” He said earlier that more stakes were possible for sectors important to US national security, including in rare earths, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and steel. In rare earths, the administration would also set price floors and strategic stockpiles. Under Donald Trump, the US has shifted from subsidies to direct stakes in companies including Intel Corp, minerals miner Trilogy Metals and rare earths miner MP Materials. “We’re not going to come in and take stakes in non-strategic industries, but we’ve identified seven industries” to develop domestically, Bessent said. The government had to be “very careful not to overreach” and to ensure that investments were meeting its strategic goals, he added. Bessent spoke days after Beijing announced fresh controls on the export of rare earth technologies and items, leading Trump to threaten 100% tariff on goods from China starting on 1 November. China is the world’s leading producer of the minerals used to make magnets crucial to the auto, electronic and defence industries. US trade representative Jamieson Greer warned at a Wednesday press briefing that US plans for a tariff hike or other export controls were in the works. “China’s announcement [on export controls] is nothing more than a global supply chain power grab,” he said. “This move is not proportional retaliation. It is an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world.” Bessent said US and Chinese officials were in touch to set up a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, adding that it was the level of trust between the two leaders that had prevented a further escalation of the trade conflict. The US does not want to decouple from China, but would have to take action if Beijing proved to be an unreliable supplier, Bessent said, noting that Chinese officials recently told US auto companies that a slowdown in shipments of rare earth magnets was “probably something” to do with a holiday. “Not only is China fuelling Russia’s war [in Ukraine], but China’s actions have once again demonstrated the risk of being dependent on them, on rare earths and for that matter, anything,” Bessent said, adding, “If China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple.” With Reuters and Agence France-Presse",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/us-stakes-rare-earths-companies-tackle-china-power,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f81ea31269929e0dca34f23084b60f186e770ba/0_0_2953_2364/master/2953.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03230d5a0f3c7c469a6c08ede16583d1",2025-10-16T04:32:15+00:00,9e71a1b5c9bec6836cd50983ac65b2469409feac
0b2effccf039,South Korea bans travel to parts of Cambodia amid deepening scam crisis that has left 80 missing,,"South Korea has issued its most serious travel warning for parts of Cambodia, issuing a “code black” ban that orders citizens to leave areas in which the government has identified surging employment scams and detention cases targeting its nationals. The travel prohibition covers the border towns of Poipet and Bavet, along with the Bokor Mountain region in Kampot province, 140km south-west of Phnom Penh, where a 22-year-old Korean student was allegedly tortured to death in August. About 60 South Koreans remain detained by Cambodian authorities after a crackdown on scam operations, while another 80 cannot be accounted for, officials said. “We are making efforts to ensure repatriation by this weekend,” said South Korea’s top security adviser, Wi Sung-lac, who has formed an emergency taskforce to retrieve citizens affected by the scams. However, the government has acknowledged the complex nature of the crisis, noting that returnees will face “investigation and judicial measures depending on their level of involvement” in the criminal networks, he said. The number of kidnappings of South Koreans in Cambodia has soared in recent months. Victims of scams are typically lured with promises of high-paying jobs before being confined in compounds and forced to participate in online fraud operations. Witness accounts from rescued Koreans reveal the brutal conditions inside the compounds. Victims described being tortured with electric shock devices and “indiscriminately” beaten with metal pipes by Chinese supervisers, according to Yonhap News . “I don’t know if I fainted or just collapsed from lack of strength, but I couldn’t even scream,” one told the news agency. One South Korean living in Cambodia told Yonhap that deaths were common and alleged that some victims were sold to organised crime syndicates and allegedly had their organs removed when they could no longer work or have nothing more to extort financially. A high-level South Korean delegation led by second vice-foreign minister Kim Jina arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday evening, accompanied by officials from the justice ministry and police and intelligence agencies. The team is seeking to coordinate the repatriation of detained Koreans, possibly via charter flight. It is unclear how quickly they can be repatriated, as many are reportedly insisting on remaining in Cambodia. Separately, Korean authorities are also investigating whether the death of a woman in her 30s found near the Vietnam-Cambodia border last week is connected to the criminal networks. Labour minister Kim Young-hoon announced plans to meet representatives from recruitment websites to strengthen filtering systems against fraudulent recruitment advertisements. The crisis has exposed how an estimated 1,000 South Koreans have become entangled in Cambodia’s sprawling scam industry, according to security adviser Wi, who said the sector involves 200,000 people of various nationalities in online operations targeting victims worldwide.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/south-korea-bans-travel-to-parts-of-cambodia-amid-deepening-scam-crisis-that-has-left-80-missing,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e7dbd577a1bc4a2c3770109a0ae1b0a4a08fdc/150_0_6536_5229/master/6536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d8c8290117e7c4332df47d6b2a3e83b",2025-10-16T03:59:40+00:00,cc55c61e53a3ef117fd7496a0c8f1e7011a3d763
afeef0bdc655,An unexpected unemployment rate rise puts the RBA odds-on to cut the cash rate – but it’s a headache for Jim Chalmers,,"Hear that? That’s the sound of the jobs market creaking, if not cracking. Australia’s unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to a four-year high of 4.5% in September, up from 4.3% the month before. Jim Chalmers is in Washington DC attending a G20 summit, but still found time to put out a statement reminding us that the jobless measure is “still very low by historical standards”. That’s a fair statement. Not counting the pandemic and its aftermath, you need to go back 17 years to find a lower jobless rate. The jump in the share market after the data release pointed to firming bets that the Reserve Bank was now odds-on to deliver a rate cut at its Melbourne Cup day meeting . But low unemployment is a prize we must not lose, and the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics will be a major worry for the treasurer – as it will be for all Australians . The resilient labour market is the jewel in Labor’s crown when it comes to its economic record, even overshadowing the major decline in living standards that has been a feature of the post-pandemic landscape. Chart showing jobless rate increasing Unemployment at 4.5% is no disaster, but it is very much not part of the plan – and it raises the fear that it could go higher still. The RBA had expected the jobless rate to peak at 4.3% this year and stay there through 2026, which aligns with the budget forecasts. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Two-a-half weeks ago the central bank’s monetary policy board held the cash rate as board members fretted that inflation would come in hotter-than-expected in the three months to September. They will surely be reconsidering their options today, and Thursday’s figures mean the RBA is now favourite to act when it next meets. The chance of a November rate cut jumped from 36% to 64% after the jobs report, according to pricing in financial markets, while the chance of a cut by December jumped from 60% to a near certainty. There were even murmurings in the market on Thursday afternoon of a double rate cut, which is surely premature. Rising inflation and climbing unemployment would be a headache for the central bank. Much now hinges on the September quarter consumer price report on 29 October, but it would have to be pretty bad to stay the central bank’s hand. The key question is: was September’s labour force data a monthly blip, or the start of something worse? The answers lie in the cross currents that have been shifting below what has been, until now at least, a largely becalmed jobs market. Pat Bustamante, an economist at Westpac, says rapid hiring in government-backed sectors such as aged care and the NDIS helped drive the post-Covid employment boom, despite underwhelming economic growth. That impulse has since faded, and the dynamic has reversed: employment growth has slowed even as the economy has picked up. Which means much depends on whether the private sector, which tends not to be as labour-intensive, can maintain enough hiring momentum to keep unemployment low – something RBA board members also discussed at their recent meeting. If it can’t, then Bustamante calculates that the unemployment rate could reach as high as 4.8% early next year, which is perilously close to losing all the post-pandemic labour market gains. That’s not something the central bank, or the government, would want to risk.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/unemployment-rate-rise-rba-cut-cash-rate-jim-chalmers,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5e036f70ef84efb194249932f1f60e6f4ff7c2/436_0_4697_3758/master/4697.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d88a0c161d518f86aea6eaaec911a6fe",2025-10-16T06:20:07+00:00,7504a3b309c9f6db9612692b3574eb8f6575aa79
fdb5bcce2c94,From The Descendants to Gina: Guardian Australia’s nominations for the 70th annual Walkley awards,,"Guardian Australia has picked up four nominations in the 70th annual Walkley awards for excellence in journalism. The Indigenous affairs team was nominated twice – in coverage of Indigenous affairs and digital media: innovation journalism – for The Descendants project. The multi-part series, which built on Guardian Australia’s 2019 Walkley-award winning series The Killing Times , explored the deeply personal process of truth-telling about some of the most horrific incidents in Australia’s past, from both sides of the frontier. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The team was led by Lorena Allam, Guardian Australia’s former editor of Indigenous Affairs, now industry professor at the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research at UTS, as well as former Guardian Australia Indigenous affairs reporter Sarah Collard, and Guardian Australia Indigenous affairs reporter, Ella Archibald-Binge. The Descendants data and interactive were built by data and interactives editor, Nick Evershed, and editorial developer Andy Ball. Illustrations are by picture desk producer and illustrator, Victoria Hart, with photography by Yamatji man Tamati Smith and Guardian Australia photographers Ellen Smith and Blake Sharp-Wiggins. Chief investigations correspondent, Christopher Knaus, and investigations reporter, Ariel Bogle, were nominated for the series on hanging points in prisons – Fatal Inaction – in the Indigenous affairs category, edited by investigations and major projects editor, Marni Cordell. The series revealed 57 inmates have died in 19 separate prisons using hanging points that authorities knew about. It shone a light on Australia’s inaction to remove hanging points from its jails, despite it being a key recommendation of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. Guardian Australia’s podcast series Gina: Power, Privilege and Influence was nominated in the audio long category. It delved into the life and ambitions of Gina Rinehart – Australia’s wealthiest person. Senior investigations correspondent, Sarah Martin, presented the podcast. The team also included series producer, Joe Koning, executive producer, Shelley Hepworth, former head of audio Miles Martignoni, and business and economics reporter, Luca Ittimani. Additional production was by Farz Edraki and Jess Hamilton. Guardian Australia’s picture editor, Carly Earl, also won the Nikon portrait prize for an her photograph , “Riley on the Southern Roma Road” which depicted drover Riley Swanson watching the sunset over the Roma Southern Road in Queensland. Guardian Australia lifestyle editor, Alyx Gorman’s, book All Women Want was included in the longlist previously announced for the Walkley Book Award . Based on 130 interviews and field reports, the book examines the love lives of women, and specifically why physical pleasure might be the final frontier in gender equality. Shona Martyn, chief executive of the Walkley Foundation, said the finalists exemplified quality public interest journalism. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

43d7b10373be,"News Corp told by Liberal MP that allegations about Sam Groth and wife were ‘political hit job’, couple’s lawyers say",,"A News Corp reporter failed to include a Victorian Liberal MP’s statement that allegations about the party’s deputy leader Sam Groth’s relationship with his wife were “nothing more than a political hit job” in a story, lawyers for the couple say. The Herald and Weekly Times (HWT), reporter Stephen Drill and Herald Sun editor Sam Weir are being sued in the federal court by Brittany Groth – in the first test of new laws for serious invasions of privacy – and by Sam Groth, for defamation over a series of articles published in July. The articles allege the couple met at a tennis club in suburban Melbourne and started a sexual relationship when Brittany was 16 or 17 and Sam was 23 or 24 and working as her coach, according to court documents. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In its defence, filed in the federal court earlier this month, the News Corp paper confirmed it would be using the public interest defence, arguing the allegations could have been “weaponised” by both Sam’s detractors within the Liberal party and Labor ahead of the 2026 state election. The tabloid also argued its reporting was exempt from the new privacy laws, which allow for damages of up to $478,000, due to the legal protections for journalists. But in a response filed on Wednesday, lawyers for the Groths said HWT published “at best, gossip, rumour, and irrational conclusions based on scant information” which no reasonable person or journalist would classify as either news or public interest reporting. They allege that on 30 June, a month before publication of the first report, Drill contacted the Liberal MP for Brighton, James Newbury, informing him he was working on a story “about Sam and Brittany having commenced their relationship illegally because she was underage and he was her coach”. According to the Groths’ lawyers, Newbury told Drill he did not believe the allegations were true and would go on the record to say they were “nothing more than a political hit job from inside the party room that was not based on fact but an untruthful smear”. But Newbury’s statement was not included in the article. The Groths’ lawyers said Newbury is referred to as “Confidential Source 6” in HWT’s defence, who told Drill “that story is not true”. In its defence, HWT argued the conversation was further proof senior Liberal members were “already aware of concerns having been raised regarding the circumstances in which Sam commenced a romantic relationship with Brittany”. HWT claims in the defence that in late 2024 and mid-2025 there were concerns within the party about when the Groths’ relationship started, the “propriety of Sam having commenced that relationship, whether Sam may have committed a criminal offence when he commenced the relationship”. They argue there were fears “such matters might be weaponised against the Liberal party by its political opponents, and whether in all the circumstances Sam’s position as deputy leader of the Liberal party represented a risk or liability to the prospects of electoral success”, the defence said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The defence also shows Herald Sun deputy editor Chris Tinkler was involved in researching the story, with documents saying that Tinkler obtained a Facebook photo on 17 December from an unnamed source showing Sam and Brittany in May 2012, attending a school formal as a couple. She was 18 at the time. The defence also includes photos of the couple’s trip to Bali for Brittany’s 18th birthday in April 2012 and previous interviews with Tennis Channel in 2017 and in July 2024 with Herald Sun reporter Mitch Clarke, in both of which the Groths said they met at the tennis club. In the Herald Sun interview, Groth said he added Brittany as a Facebook friend immediately after meeting her. The defence said Tinkler had also spoken to a Labor party source who said that two of its MPs were aware that Brittany might have been underage when her romantic relationship with Sam began, and that in that source’s view, “what he has done is really not appropriate”.

d25af61c493a,Closure of GP clinics will leave thousands of vulnerable Victorians without ‘lifesaving healthcare’,,"Thousands of Victorians with complex health needs who are also facing homelessness, trauma and family violence will be forced to find a new GP after the sudden announcement that services at three cohealth clinics will close. Cohealth provides a range of integrated health and social support services across Melbourne, often at no cost. A cohealth spokesperson said on Thursday that GP services will end at the Collingwood, Fitzroy, and Kensington sites in December. All other services such as allied health will also close at the Collingwood site in mid-2026, but will be relocated to the Fitzroy site. More than 12,000 patients will be affected. “This has been an extraordinarily difficult, but unavoidable decision,” the cohealth CEO, Nicole Bartholomeusz, said. “These GP services cared for multiple generations of people, and we know the impact will be deeply felt.” The decision was made due to “multiple, complex pressures including decades of underinvestment, ageing infrastructure, and a funding model that doesn’t match the reality of the need or the type of care that is required,” she said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email A spokesperson for the federal health department described the move as “deeply disappointing”. “We have requested the board reconsider its position,” the spokesperson said. “The Department of Health and North Western Melbourne Primary Health Network has met with cohealth to identify possible solutions to improve financial sustainability, including through maximising Medicare Benefits Schedule billing.” A Victorian government spokesperson said community health organisations play an “important role and we continue to provide them with significant funding”. They said $188m was invested last year to support the delivery of care across the state. “We’ll continue to advocate to the commonwealth to address medicare rebates for patients with complex care needs.” From November, Medicare Benefits Schedule changes will see additional funding go to clinics which bulk bill every patient. But a GP with the Collingwood cohealth clinic, Dr Cath Keaney, said these federal Medicare reforms were coming too late to save the clinics. There were also structural issues affecting the buildings which were in desperate need of repair, she said, “with leaks in the roof and buckets catching water during storms”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

208928ff824e,French Socialist party to fight for wealth tax as it seeks to capitalise on crisis,,"The French Socialist party says it will fight to introduce a flagship wealth tax to raise revenue by targeting France’s richest people, as the divided parliament prepares to begin debating next year’s budget. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist party grouping in parliament, said on Wednesday that taxing very high-wealth individuals in France was “one of our principal battles and we’re going to put all our energy into it”. The centre-left party is seeking to capitalise on the unprecedented political crisis that has weakened the new centrist prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, after he resigned last week and was reappointed four days later . The Socialists are now proposing the “Zucman tax”, named after an idea put forward by the French economist Gabriel Zucman, under which a 2% levy would be imposed on wealth above €100m, which would affect about 0.01% of taxpayers. The prime minister faces his first major test on Thursday morning when two votes of no-confidence are expected to be held in an attempt to topple his minority government, one put forward by the leftwing La France Insoumise and the other by Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally. Lecornu is likely to survive after the Socialist party decided to stand back and not join the vote to bring him down. The Socialist party leadership said it would instead pin its hopes on Lecornu’s promised parliamentary debate of the contested 2026 budget. The budget, which aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of GDP from this year’s 5.4%, hinges on a squeeze of more than €30bn, including cuts to corporate tax breaks, tighter rules on social welfare contributions, and new taxes. To secure the Socialists’ decision not to topple him, Lecornu made a significant concession to suspend Macron’s landmark pension changes , which were forced through in 2023 amid large street demonstrations and which had begun to raise the pension age from 62 to 64 over several years. The Socialists, aware that they would hold deciding votes in any attempt to topple the government, now want to use that leverage to push some form of wealth tax, despite strong opposition from Macron’s centrists. Their leader, Olivier Faure, wrote on social media: “In the forthcoming debate, we on the left will be working together to defend the Zucman tax and public services and to protect the poorest.” He said if the Zucman tax was not passed “we’ll have other proposals on a whole range of ways of targeting large fortunes, high wealth and big companies”. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month, Zucman said the wealthiest households in many countries paid less income tax than most citizens, and in France that gap was especially stark. “Firstly, billionaires pay virtually no income tax in France, and secondly their wealth has grown particularly rapidly over the last 15 years,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A group of seven leading economists, writing in the French newspaper Le Monde this month, said the tax would be likely to yield closer to €5bn and could cause wealthy people to leave France. Lecornu has publicly opposed the tax, but in his first policy speech to parliament on Tuesday he said he would ask for an exceptional levy on large fortunes. The prime minister said suspending the pension changes would have a cost to the public purse, and the shortfall would have to be made up.

3ac3490fe946,‘I need to do everything now’: the Ukrainian combat medic-turned playwright,,"Eighteen months ago, Alina Sarnatska was serving as a combat medic on Ukraine’s frontline – including in the hellish battle for Bakhmut – and had barely been to the theatre. Six months later, she was preparing to watch the premiere of her first play in Kyiv. Now Sarnatska, 38, has several dramas under her belt and is emerging as one of Ukraine’s most powerful voices in the theatre. It is a dizzying transformation for a person who, though she had loved writing when she was young, associated the word “playwright” with distant figures such as Shakespeare, rather than anyone like herself. She attributes the sheer speed of her emergence to the war. “I think Russians will kill me, maybe after two years, maybe after three years, by drones, rockets or in the street,” she said. “So I don’t have time. I need to do everything right now and right here.” Military Mama was one of 15 plays selected for a programme called Theatre of Veterans. Photograph: Oleg Palchyk Her first performed play, Military Mama, was written as part of a programme called Theatre of Veterans . The scheme, co-founded by the dramatist Maksym Kurochkin, who himself fought in the eastern region of Luhansk in 2022, aims to transform soldiers and veterans from theatre novices to performed playwrights – bringing their battlefield experiences to the stage. Sarnatska was one of 15 selected for the scheme after an open call. Military Mama was a standout script and was produced on one of Kyiv’s main stages at the Left Bank theatre. It tells the story of an ordinary woman’s experience in the army, tackling motherhood, sexism in the military, relationship breakdown, mental health problems and desertion – unheroic subjects that, while not exactly taboo in Ukrainian society, are largely absent from official narratives. Her frankness as a writer and refusal to adopt a simplistic, morale-boosting position does not always go down well. A performance this month in the frontline city of Dnipro of her prize-winning play Balance, about the often horrific experiences of a battlefield medic, was attended by priests and officials from the city council who then complained to the theatre. “After the performance, the director came out to apologise for the swearing and the realism,” she said. “But it didn’t help, and the theatre representatives were summoned to the city administration and scolded for the performance because it was sad, not heroic, and contained bad language.” But her plays are also welcomed by theatregoers for their brute honesty about the realities of the frontline. Some audience members were in tears after a performance of Military Mama this summer in Kyiv, and the cast took part in a post-show discussion. One woman, whose husband was at the front, and another audience member, the father of a veteran, thanked the actors for helping them understand something of life in the trenches. It is a play in which “all soldiers can recognise themselves because it’s about very ordinary military life”, said Sarnatska. But it does not hold back on its criticism of civilian characters, who go about their lives oblivious to the horrors their compatriots are living, or dying, through. In some after-show discussions audience members have asked whether she hates civilians, she said. “Every time I’m asked that I stay silent,” she said. Instead, she lets the more emollient director take the question. Actors perform Penelope, based on women waiting for their loved ones to come home, at the Lesya Ukrainka theatre in Lviv. Photograph: Ertugrul Sevim A new play, Penelope, based on women waiting for their loved ones to come home from the war, premiered this summer at the Lesya Ukrainka theatre in Lviv. It is partly inspired by Penelope, Odysseus’s long-suffering wife, who, in Homer’s Odyssey, waits for him to return from the Trojan war for 20 years. Its cast of seven women, as well as its director, Svitlana Fedeshova, all have partners who are serving. “I could write some heroic story, saying everything is OK,” she said of the play. “But I don’t want a situation where a woman who is waiting for her husband comes to the theatre and sees some kind of fairytale telling her everything is OK, and then she leaves, and she still waiting. That’s what I want to avoid.” Sarnatska – who was a sex worker for several years, including while she was studying for a degree in psychology – was working with NGOs as a social worker before Russia’s full-scale invasion, supporting female victims of violence and those with substance addictions; and campaigning for sex workers’ rights. Alina Sarnatska, centre, during a minute’s silence in Kyiv. Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian Since her departure from military service, she has been working on her PhD, organising protests to improve soldiers’ rights, and working with a support network for wounded soldiers and their families. She is now undertaking a writing residency in Germany, where she has been working on a novel. Before being accepted for the Theatre of Veterans programme, she said she knew nothing about theatre or dramatists. “I knew Shakespeare was a dramatist, and that’s all.” But she posted prolifically on social media during her time as a combat medic, often writing pithy and memorable dialogues as part of her fundraising efforts for her unit. It was because of those dialogues that a friend urged her to apply for Theatre of Veterans. That said, she is still not much of a theatre fan herself. “I hate theatre,” she said. “OK, by now I have seen some interesting things. But it’s not something to do in my free time.” Her writing god is, in fact, the novelist Stephen King. “If you write a good story, it will work on the stage,” she said. A further play, Menstruation, is due to premiere at the end of the year at Molodyy theatre in Kyiv. It is about the experiences of sex workers as the tide of the 2022 invasion crashed around them – stories that have rarely been aired publicly in Ukraine. She has recently completed a play called Fat, set in the present day and the 1930s, that connects disordered eating in modern Ukraine with the Holodomor , the human-made famine in which up to 3 million people died in 1932-33 – a result of Stalin’s brutally enforced grain quotas.",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/16/alina-sarnatska-ukrainian-combat-medic-playwright,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2485fb791d6cac8a5c869f3b34ab4e98ffdc6a41/228_0_2084_1667/master/2084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53b0b6c483be4cb25a653dd57e7791df",2025-10-16T04:00:57+00:00,e084241349651d6a6ad027b5ac14b7ab6c01ff7b
222b1b21db4b,"Plug-in hybrids pollute almost as much as petrol cars, report finds",,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) pump out nearly five times more planet-heating pollution than official figures show, a report has found. The cars, which can run on electric batteries as well as combustion engines, have been promoted by European carmakers as a way to cover long distances in a single drive – unlike fully electric cars – while still reducing emissions. Data shows PHEVs emit just 19% less CO 2 than petrol and diesel cars, an analysis by the non-profit advocacy group Transport and Environment found on Thursday. Under laboratory tests, they were assumed to be 75% less polluting. The researchers analysed data from the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 cars registered in Europe between 2021 and 2023. They found real-world carbon dioxide emissions from PHEVs in 2023 were 4.9 times greater than those from standardised laboratory tests, having risen from being 3.5 times greater in 2021. “Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report. “This is the gap that is getting worse and it is a real problem. As a result, PHEVs pollute almost as much as petrol cars.” The researchers attributed most of the gap to overestimates of the “utility factor” – the ratio of miles travelled in electric mode to the total miles travelled – finding that 27% of driving was done in electric mode even though official estimates assumed 84%. The European Commission has announced two corrections to the utility factor ratio that will narrow the gap but not close it entirely, according to the analysis. Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates. The researchers said this was because electric motors were not strong enough to operate alone, with their engines burning fossil fuels for almost one-third of the distance travelled in electric mode. Patrick Plötz, head of energy economics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “very useful contribution” after years in which parts of the automotive industry argued there was too little data to accurately assess real-world emissions. “The results demonstrate, beyond any doubt, that the gap between official and real-world PHEV fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions is much, much larger than for gasoline or diesel cars,” said Plötz, who has published research on the topic. “Any policy changes with respect to PHEVs should be made with utmost care and in the light of that data.” Hybrid cars have been drawn back into the political debate as carmakers have pressed the EU to weaken CO 2 targets. A ban on new combustion engine cars in 2035 has been subject to heavy lobbying from the automotive industry and opposition from member states with large car industries. “There must not be a drastic cut in 2035,” the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said after a summit last week with the country’s struggling automobile industry, promising to do “everything in [his] power” to achieve that. Other senior German politicians have floated plug-in hybrids as one example of possible “flexibilities” they could introduce to the legislation. skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

They added that drivers of PHEVs would also be paying about €500 more a year in running costs than would be assumed under laboratory tests. “The bold claims that manufacturers like to make about their plug-in hybrid vehicles are clearly way off the mark,” said Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “Consumers are being duped into believing that in buying a PHEV, they are helping the environment and saving money,” he said. “In reality, PHEVs are little better than regular petrol and diesel cars when it comes to the fuel they consume, the CO 2 they produce and the money they cost to run.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/16/plug-in-hybrids-pollute-almost-as-much-as-petrol-cars-report-finds,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c2db07dea96b8ac0349b221f3ecebb2c8543d5/582_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79b5d0c09db3a4b6415c8f190ba0469a",2025-10-16T04:00:55+00:00,3a95969099094dbd587705cf6738ae0c43607d9d
b7054ce49645,US Congress committee investigating Musk-owned Starlink over Myanmar scam centres,,"A powerful bipartisan committee in the US Congress says it has begun an investigation into the involvement of Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite business in providing internet access to Myanmar scam centres , blamed for swindling billions from victims across the world. The move comes as it was revealed that large numbers of Starlink dishes began appearing on scam-centre roofs in Myanmar around the time of a crackdown in February that was supposed to eradicate the centres, according to a investigation by Agence France-Presse Starlink has come from nowhere to become the war-torn country’s biggest internet provider in three months, data from the APNIC Asian regional internet registry shows. SpaceX, Starlink’s owner, has not replied to AFP requests for comment. The US Congress joint economic committee told the news agency it began an investigation in July into Starlink’s involvement with the scam centres. The committee has the power to make Musk testify before it. China, Thailand and Myanmar forced pro-junta Myanmar militias who protect the centres into promising to “eradicate” the compounds in February. They freed about 7,000 people – most Chinese citizens – from the brutal call centre-style system, which the UN says runs on forced labour and human trafficking. Many workers said they were beaten and forced to work long hours by scam bosses who target victims across the globe with telephone, internet and social media cons. Senator Maggie Hassan, the leading Democrat on the US congressional committee, has called on Musk to block the Starlink service to the fraud factories. “While most people have probably noticed the increasing number of scam texts, calls and emails, they may not know that transnational criminals halfway across the world may be perpetrating these scams by using Starlink internet access,” she said. The senator wrote to Musk in July demanding answers to 11 questions about Starlink’s role. Former California prosecutor Erin West, who now heads the Operation Shamrock group campaigning against the centres, said: “It is abhorrent that an American company is enabling this to happen.” While still a cybercrime prosecutor, she warned Starlink in July 2024 that the mostly Chinese crime syndicates that run the centres were using its technology, but received no reply. Americans are among the top targets of south-east Asia scammers, the US treasury department said, losing an estimated $10bn last year, up 66% in 12 months. Up to 120,000 people may be being “forced to carry out online scams” in the Myanmar centres, according to a UN report in 2023. On the Thailand-Myanmar border, new buildings have been springing up inside the heavily guarded compounds around Myawaddy at a fast pace, with some festooned with Starlink receivers, satellite images and AFP drone footage show. Analysis of satellite images from Planet Labs PBC found dozens of buildings going up or being altered in the largest of the compounds, KK Park, between March and September.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/us-congress-committee-investigating-musk-owned-starlink-over-myanmar-scam-centres,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ea3448dc3ccc4bb2d7a6ca44ea38d37c57ca5c3/894_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1060b9461291e6c6fafd0108ab6bf664",2025-10-14T04:42:29+00:00,d80ed5f485def7011cd9761f42102884e7b25657
7be36c52585e,UK economy expands as GDP rises by 0.1% in August ahead of crucial budget,,"The UK economy expanded by 0.1% in August, according to official figures, giving a lift to Rachel Reeves ahead of next month’s crucial budget. A boost from the manufacturing sector helped the economy improve along with a strong performance by the health sector. However, the Office for National Statistics said it had revised down July’s flatlining growth to a 0.1% contraction, limiting the rise in output over the three months to August to 0.3%. The chancellor is weighing up raising funds from a series of tax rises in her 26 November budget to close a £20bn to £30bn budget spending gap that has opened up this year. The figures were in line with a Reuters poll of City economists, which expected a return to modest growth of 0.1% in August based mainly on a recovery in the manufacturing sector. It keeps the UK on track to meet International Monetary Fund forecasts on Tuesday that it will be the second-fastest growing economy in the G7 group this year . Inflation is forecast to begin easing before the end of the year and the Bank of England is expected to make further interest rate cuts in 2026, easing the pressure on household incomes. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck.

cb6d4a288b7e,Britney Spears calls claims in Kevin Federline’s memoir ‘extremely hurtful’,,"Britney Spears has responded to her ex-husband Kevin Federline’s claims in his upcoming memoir about their marriage, calling his depiction of her “extremely hurtful and exhausting”. In You Thought You Knew, Federline details his two-year marriage with Spears and their divorce in 2007, which was followed by a protracted battle over custody of their two sons, Sean Preston and Jayden James. In the book, Federline claims he witnessed Spears use cocaine while breastfeeding, and that she sometimes behaved erratically around their children. In an excerpt published by the New York Times , Federline alleged their sons “would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep – ‘Oh, you’re awake?’ – with a knife in her hand. Then she’d turn around and pad off without explanation.” Federline told the New York Times he had not spoken to Spears in years, but said he learned about her alleged behaviour from their two sons. Federline also writes in the book about the conservatorship Spears was under between 2008 and 2021, which saw her father control her life and finances. The arrangement prompted Spears’ fans to form the #FreeBritney movement to have her independence restored. While the #FreeBritney movement may have “started from a good place”, Federline writes in the book, “All those people who put so much effort into that should now put the same energy into the ‘Save Britney’ movement. Because this is no longer about freedom. It’s about survival.” “This situation with Britney feels like it’s racing toward something irreversible,” he writes. “It’s become impossible to pretend everything’s OK. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the 11th hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.” On Wednesday, Spears disputed Federline’s depiction in a statement on social media. “The constant gaslighting from ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting,” the eight-time Grammy-winning artist wrote on X. “I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys.” She said she felt “demoralised by this situation” and that she had seldom seen her sons, who are now 19 and 20 years old, in recent years. “Relationships with teenage boys is complex,” she wrote. “They need to take responsibility for themselves. With one son only seeing me for 45 min in the past five years and the other with only four visits in the past five years. I have pride too. From now on I will let them know when I am available.” “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here,” she added. She said she had been living a “sacred and private life” since she was released from the conservatorship. In an earlier statement, a spokesperson for the pop star told the New York Times, “With news from Kevin’s book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James and their wellbeing during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.” In Spears’ 2023 memoir, The Woman in Me, the pop star claimed that, during their custody battle, Federline “tried to convince everyone that I was completely out of control”.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/16/britney-spears-ex-husband-kevin-federline-memoir,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52bcd1a03ad0e8aec35d4a0dec68589d57bab57c/18_0_2345_1875/master/2345.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57e47b9916b16544dac198db624a6793",2025-10-16T06:05:12+00:00,134c0fba7ca0d277970ccbe70bddd26e8fb23bac
b24bd56c4949,San Francisco opposes ‘authoritarian crackdown’ as Trump threatens to send troops,,"Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that San Francisco could be the next city he targets with federal troops, threatening a deployment that local and state officials have said is unnecessary and unwelcome. Speaking at the White House to FBI director Kash Patel, the president said: “I’m going to be strongly recommending, at the request of government officials … that you start looking at San Francisco … one of our great cities 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and now it’s a mess … Every American deserves to live in a community where they’re not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot.” Just like the federal deployments in Portland, Chicago, Washington DC and Los Angeles earlier this year, the Democratic leaders of San Francisco and California have not requested the kind of crackdown Trump is pushing on the basis of false and hyperbolic claims of out-of-control crime. San Francisco, the home town of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has for months anticipated that the Bay Area city could end up in the crosshairs of the president. Trump has long complained about the city, saying during his campaign last year that his opponent, Kamala Harris, had “destroyed” it and that it went from being “the best city” to “not even livable”. Trump has become increasingly invested in sending national guard troops to cities run by Democrats, despite longstanding federal law that widely prohibits the domestic use of US troops to enforce criminal laws. In Chicago and Los Angeles, the deployments of troops coincided with aggressive and at times violent immigration raids , prompting mass protests that were met by a strong show of force by law enforcement. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on potential plans for San Francisco, referring back to the president’s remarks. San Francisco and California leaders have said they oppose Trump’s intervention and have worked to convey that there is no crisis of crime and violence that requires outside help or a militarized response. State senator Scott Wiener said in a Wednesday statement that the city “neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets”. “Contrary to Trump’s lie, no ‘government officials’ here have requested federal occupation. We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: stay the hell out of San Francisco,” the Democrat said. Mano Raju, the San Francisco public defender, said in an email that his office “condemns any attempt to deploy military forces against the residents of our city”, noting that courts had already ruled against the president’s national guard deployments. “Using armed force against civilians is an abuse of power and a misuse of public resources. Our communities are strong, organized, and deeply committed to peaceful civic engagement in the face of injustice – and we will continue to stand with residents exercising their rights lawfully and peacefully,” Raju said. Newsom’s office said Wednesday that overall violent crime in major California cities was down 12.5% in 2025 compared with last year, with a 22% decrease in San Francisco. From 2019 to 2025, the city saw a 45% decrease in homicides and 40% drop in robberies, the governor added. The city is on track to have the lowest number of homicides in more than 70 years, according to a recent San Francisco Chronicle analysis . Newsom also said his administration had recently expanded “crime suppression teams” in the San Francisco area, with state officers assisting local agencies in a range of operations. The governor, embracing his anti-Trump social media trolling strategy , posted the footage of Trump saying San Francisco was great 15 years ago, responding : “Why, thank you!” Newsom was mayor from 2004 through 2010. Daniel Lurie, the current mayor, spoke alongside the San Francisco sheriff and district attorney earlier on Wednesday, touting declines in crime, increased police recruitment and partnerships with state and federal agencies to combat drug trafficking, the Chronicle reported . “We have a lot of work to do, but I trust our local law enforcement,” the mayor said, according to the paper. Brooke Jenkins, the district attorney, said San Francisco asks for federal help when it needs it, but that local leaders “have this issue under control”. Their assertions came days after Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce, said he was in favor of Trump sending in national guard troops to San Francisco, a comment that sparked intense backlash. Immigrants rights’ advocates said they were bracing for the potential arrival of troops or escalating enforcement efforts. Amanda Maya, asylum program director with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, a non-profit, said rapid-response networks in the region, which defend immigrant communities, were making sure they had sufficient capacity to respond to a potential surge in detentions. “My biggest concern is it creates an environment of fear, not just for those without documentation, but for everyone,” she said, of the potential deployment of troops. “People will be afraid to leave their homes, to go to work, to access essential services.” She said her clients were already avoiding visiting hospitals or going to the police to report crimes due to anxiety about immigration authorities. Advocates were continuing to hold “know your rights” training sessions, reminding immigrants they should assert their rights to remain silent if they are detained, avoid signing documents and make sure they are in touch with attorneys, Maya said, adding: “We’re definitely preparing.”’ Maya argued that it was particularly “wasteful and irresponsible” to consider deploying troops at a time when the federal government is shut down, leading to cuts in critical services: “This is so unnecessary.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/san-francisco-trump-national-guard-troops,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c8b3f0ee3fcbe14c70bb83434bb90c1f3a131b/249_0_2501_2001/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1169faa0b06e585e43e9bba026fd7d6a",2025-10-16T05:00:59+00:00,8e7fd2d75ca18dc055f68c2ce7fa365e2aafdcbe

UK GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.1% in August, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. That will be a relief to chancellor Rachel Reeves. But there’s bad news too – the economy is now thought to have shrunk by 0.1% in July, revised down from the initial estimate of no growth. The ONS also reports that GDP grew by 0.3% in the three months to August 2025 compared with the three months to May 2025, a slight increase following growth of 0.2% in the three months to July 2025. Share Updated at 02.03 EDT Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Deutsche Bank: services and construction sectors have hit a pre-Budget funk Britain’s services and construction sectors have been hit by a “pre-budget funk”, warns Sanjay Raja , Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, amid uncertainty about Rachel Reeves’s fiscal plans. Following today’s GDP report showing there was no services growth in August, while construction fell by 0.3%, Raja explains: Industrial production expanded by 0.4% m/m, led in large part by stronger manufacturing growth (0.7% m/m). The bad news? Both the services and construction sectors have hit a pre-Budget funk. The services economy was unchanged for a second consecutive month – this time, led by weaker transport and storage activity as well as weaker retail activity (particularly from lower new car registrations) and leisure services. And construction output shrunk by 0.3% m/m, dragged down by lower repairs and maintenance work to end the summer. Deutsche Bank now estimates growth in the third quarter of this year is tracking closer to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter - roughly half the pace pencilled in by the Bank of England. Raja adds: To be sure, the economy is now running at a lower gear after a strong start to the year…. We expect some turbulence to continue as we approach year-end. Indeed, the UK economy has yet to see the full ramifications of the US trade war. Budget uncertainty is hitting its peak too – likely dampening discretionary household and business spending. Economists: ""dishearteningly meagre return to growth"" as economy ""stumbles"" Economists are largely unimpressed by t he modest growth of 0.1% recorded in the UK economy in August, and the 0.3% growth in June-August period . Lindsay James, investment strategist at wealth management firm Quilter, says the economy looks to be “stumbling to the end of the year”: “In the week that the International Monetary Fund gave the UK’s economic growth forecasts a small bump up, today’s GDP figures paint a picture of an economy stumbling to the end of the year after a strong start. Monthly GDP grew just 0.1%, giving a three-month rate of 0.3% - not exactly exciting figures. Markets will have been hoping for signs that the UK can maintain it’s early-year momentum but it appears that has now dissipated just as we approach a crunch Budget statement from the Chancellor. Rachel Reeves will need to find a tonic and quickly if she is to extricate the economy from its current malaise. “There are a number of obstacles coming down the track for the economy too. The IMF confirmed the UK has an inflation problem and is struggling to get out of it. That will continue to put pressure on the consumer. Meanwhile, both businesses and individuals are fearful of what is coming at November’s budget after Rachel Reeves confirmed tax rises are being looked at. Last year showed just how much impact that uncertainty can have on economic growth and now this year appears as if it will be no different. Suren Thiru , economics director at chartered accountancy group ICAEW , calls today’s growth figures ‘anaemic’: “This dishearteningly meagre return to growth will do little to allay fears over the wellbeing of the UK economy, with higher manufacturing output masking weaker activity in other sectors, notably services and construction. “August’s increase is unlikely to have triggered a noteworthy pickup in economic growth across the third quarter with higher inflation and free-falling business confidence expected to have restrained output in September. “November’s Budget is casting a long shadow over the UK economy with growing worries over more tax rises likely to prompt greater caution among consumers and businesses to spend and invest throughout the Autumn. “While a rate cut next month looks improbable, these anaemic figures mean it’s not quite a done deal as it gives those rate setters worried over economic conditions with more encouragement to vote to relax policy.” Ruth Gregory , deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics , reckons there is little reason to think GDP growth will accelerate much from here, explaining: The meagre rise in real GDP in August suggests growth is still being hampered by high interest rates, higher taxes and soft overseas activity. With business sentiment on the floor and employment still falling, we doubt growth will improve much in Q4. Raj Badiani, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence , is similarly cautious: “UK economic growth is set to be muted in the next few quarters with private sector activity facing a damaging mix of external pressures, alongside increasing trepidation amid firms and consumers ahead of yet another difficult budget event. The latest short-term indicators suggest an end to the recent upward drift in the 2025 growth projection. “We expect UK real GDP growth to stand at 1.4% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026. Despite persistent growth concerns, still-elevated earnings growth and the prospect of headline inflation rising to 4% in September are likely to rule out a further interest rate cut this year. The first-rate cut is expected to occur in February 2026 and the Bank rate to stand at 3.25% at the end of next year.” The UK's consumer-facing services sector is struggling Today’s GDP report also highlights weakness at service sector firms focused on consumers. The UK’s consumer-facing services sector shrank by 0.6% in the three months to August, dragged down by: travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities (down 7.6%) other personal service activities (down 3.4%) buying and selling, renting and operating of own or leased real estate, excluding imputed rent (down 1.0%) Photograph: ONS Treasury: for too many people our economy feels stuck Responding to today’s GDP report, a Treasury spokesman has conceded that the economy feels ‘stuck’, saying: “We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck. Working day in, day out without getting ahead. The Chancellor is determined to turn this around by helping businesses in every town and high street grow, investing in infrastructure and cutting red tape to get Britain building.” Earlier this week the IMF predicted the UK would be the second-fastest growing member of the G7 for 2025, following a relatively fast start to the year . ONS: Some consumer facing services were weak Here’s ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown on today’s UK growth report: “Economic growth increased slightly in the latest three months. Services growth held steady, while there was a smaller drag from production than previously. “Continued strength in business rental and leasing and healthcare were the main contributors to services growth, partially offset by weakness in some consumer facing services, while wholesalers also fared poorly.” Today’s GDP report shows there was no growth in the UK services sector in August or July, but it did expand by 0.4% in the three months to August. Photograph: ONS Photograph: ONS Production grew, but construction shrank UK manufacturing drove growth in August. Today’s GDP report shows that production grew by 0.4% in the month, whereas services showed no growth and construction fell by 0.3% in August. UK economy grew by 0.1% in August. Newsflash! The UK economy has returned to growth. UK GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.1% in August, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. That will be a relief to chancellor Rachel Reeves. But there’s bad news too – the economy is now thought to have shrunk by 0.1% in July, revised down from the initial estimate of no growth. The ONS also reports that GDP grew by 0.3% in the three months to August 2025 compared with the three months to May 2025, a slight increase following growth of 0.2% in the three months to July 2025. Share Updated at 02.03 EDT Introduction: UK GDP report coming up... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK economy is about to get its report card for August. The latest monthly GDP report is expected to show only modest growth, with economists predicting an expansion of just 0.1% in August. Although modest, that would be a small improvement on the previous month, as the economy flatlined in July . Any growth will be welcome news for the government as chancellor Rachel Reeves works on the autumn budget; yesterday, she told The Guardian that higher taxes on the UK’s wealthy will form part of next month’s fiscal update. There are hopes that UK manufacturing may have picked up in August, as Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar , explains: “Manufacturing and industrial activity remain weak in the UK, with services doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of numbers thus far in 2025. Expectations are for August to show something of a reversal in this regard though, with industrial and manufacturing production likely to be positive for the month, potentially signalling some stability. “Issues remain in the UK. Inflation remains high, as do interest rates, as the Bank of England awaits assurance that inflation is under control before cutting further. Equity markets are clearly anticipating an improvement though as they sit right below all-time highs.” The agenda 7am BST: UK GDP report for August 7am BST: UK trade report for August 10am BST: Eurozone trade data for August 1pm BST: IMF Seminar: Debate on the Global Economy: “Shaping Economic Policies Amid a Shifting Global Landscape”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/oct/16/uk-gdp-economy-growth-august-reeves-budget-imf-business-live-news,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df5fa4052482e1c83201e3032cc527c81737fbd/436_0_5081_4066/master/5081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78bf8dd9627e72a137283dbedfe30806",2025-10-16T06:40:23+00:00,c5ed6b86f7de31db9b4d19c99b61a1c917823ba2
792d23372e54,Did you solve it? The London cab that rode into history,,"Earlier today I set these three puzzles, loosely based around 1729, the “taxicab number”. To read about the link between London cabs and 1729 please read the original post . 1. Square pair What is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of a pair of squares in two different ways? Hint: it is less than 100 Solution 1 2 + 7 2 = 5 2 + 5 2 = 50 2. Strip tease I have five strips of wood with lengths 1, 2, 7, 17 and 29 centimetres. It is impossible to arrange any three of these strips into a triangle. I would like to add another strip of wood, of maximum length 29cm, so that I still cannot take three strips and make a triangle. How many different lengths are possible for the seventh strip, and what are they? Lengths must be a whole number of centimetres. As a bonus, what shape can I make using only these hypothetical extra strips? CORRECTION: Previously this question had the length 9. That was a mistake. Also, no two lengths can be the same. Solution 3, 4 and 5 In a triangle, the sum of the two smaller sides need to be larger the longest side. You can make a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3, 4 and 5. 3. Sick sixth I have four numbers, a, b, c, and d. They may be whole numbers, or fractions. There are six ways to multiply two of these numbers together: ab, cd, ac, bd, ad, bc. The values of five of these products, but not necessarily in this order, are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. What is the value of the sixth product? Solution 2.4 If we multiply ab x cd or ac x bd or ad x bc we get abcd. Thus there must be two pairs from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whose product is the same. The only possibility is 2 x 6 = 3 x 4 = 12. The sixth product x 5 = 12. Thanks to George Watkins for today’s puzzles. I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

f91bf1fca021,"On a sunny day, my ex came to the hair salon where I worked – and shot me at close range",,"I t was a sunny Friday in August when Rachel Williams arrived at the hair salon where she worked in Newport, Wales . As she was shuffling clients around, she remembers “looking at the shop door or window and thinking something was obscuring the sunlight”. She quickly recognised her ex-husband Darren’s 6ft 7in frame, and instinctively ran towards him as he pulled a sawn-off shotgun out of his black duffel bag. She fought him for the gun and was soon on the floor beside a woman in her 90s called Connie, who was shouting: “Go on, get out of here, get out of here.” (“She was in the war, so made of steel.”) Rachel tried to pull a table across herself for protection but Darren kicked it away. Instead, she rolled into the foetal position, pulling her knees up under her chin. “He stood four feet away from me, told me he loved me, and pulled the trigger. My left leg took the first shot and I can remember it wasn’t a pain, it was a force.” Rachel could smell the gunpowder and looked down at her jeans where there was a gaping hole. “I remember looking and thinking, ‘Oh my God, he’s shot me.’ And then I felt a blast to the right of me, and that clearly missed my head.” She grabbed the gun with “supernatural strength”, and clung on as he stamped all over her head and punched her back. “My left ear had to be slit seven times to get rid of a huge cauliflower ear. I had a bruise from a black eye that travelled all the way down my neck and landed on my shoulder and collarbone. He battered me and then he was gone.” Rachel in hospital after the shooting. Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel Williams The hours that followed are a morphine-filled blur. The local vet came to help, followed by an ambulance and the police. Soon, she was at hospital getting treatment for her shattered shin and knee, surrounded by armed police to protect her. But by 7pm she was told that they had found Darren dead in a localwoodland; he had killed himself. “The relief,” she says. “I wasn’t even thinking about my leg.” R achel met Darren in March 1993, through a neighbour, when she was a 21-year-old single mum to Josh, who was two. Darren was witty and made her laugh. It started with a coffee but quickly became serious and, in hindsight, she knows he “love-bombed” her. “When you work in the sector and you see the eight stages of domestic abuse or the homicide timeline, you can see how quickly perpetrators will escalate moving in,” says Rachel, who founded SUTDA (Stand Up to Domestic Abuse) in January 2021, a decade after she was attacked. “Darren was living with me within 12 months, and not long after that I was pregnant with Jack. It’s all about that power and control and getting the victim to where they want them.” Every day you’re strategically thinking, as soon as you open your eyes, ‘How am I going to pacify my perpetrator today?’ The honeymoon period didn’t last long before Darren’s abuse began. He used to say: “Today I’m going to be Daniel, which is the nice side of me,” says Rachel. “Almost a bit like Jekyll and Hyde.” He quickly started belittling Rachel with comments about her being a single mother when they met, saying things like: “I found you in the gutter.” After she gave birth to Jack, he bought her a car so she could run errands, and she remembers finding it odd when he said the reason was: “I don’t want blokes eyeballing you when you’re walking around with a pushchair.” The first time she remembers fearing for her life was after an argument when she was seven months pregnant. Darren, who was “huge” and “weighed about 18 stone”, turned physically violent. She can’t remember what had angered him, but he threw an apple at her, then followed her upstairs where she was cowering beside the wardrobe. “He lifted me off the floor by my throat and said he only let me go because my lips turned blue,” says Rachel. “People might think, ‘Why didn’t she leave then?’” she says. “But when you’ve got somebody who is one of the most manipulative people you will ever meet, falling to the floor and crying like a baby and begging for forgiveness, knowing all the stuff in his life, you just think you can fix them and try to work with them. I was already a single mum and I didn’t want to be a single parent of two children by two different fathers,” she adds, feeling that she had to try to make it work. ‘Nobody was confirming this is a dangerous pattern of behaviour’ … Rachel with Darren. Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel Williams The next 18 years were all about surviving within a cycle of abuse. “Every day you’re strategically thinking, as soon as you open your eyes, ‘How am I going to pacify my perpetrator today?’ It’s all about keeping a happy home harmonious, without any reason for an outburst. It is the walking on eggshells; you’re constantly assessing things.” Rachel would feel the tension rising before an assault, which could range from him spitting in her face to strangulation, punching the back of her head and ramming his head into hers to push her against the wall. One of his favourite things to do was to place his massive hands on her face and crush it. There were a couple of silent 999 calls, where she pressed 55 to transfer the call to the police without her speaking, leading them to her location. But when the police showed up, Darren would stand behind her as they asked if everything was all right. Next would come the remorse, which would last about a week. “There was always a bouquet of flowers and chocolates and apologies,” she says: he was playing with her head. Rachel and Darren got married on 29 December 2005. Darren, who was a bouncer, was injecting steroids and taking a combination of antidepressants and sleeping tablets that Rachel thinks probably exacerbated his temper, but alcohol and drugs weren’t what triggered the abuse, which was only directed at her. “Abuse is a choice; it is done with free will,” she says. Rachel with her son Jack. Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel Williams He often let his temper bubble up in public: “He was a law unto himself,” she says. Rachel’s sister saw Darren pin her up against the burger van at Newport Docks where Rachel sometimes worked with her sister, after she arrived a little late from collecting bread rolls. “He flipped all the rolls in the air. He threw the great big diesel generator down the road. There was one guy who said to my sister: ‘That man is an animal and I will never come back here again,’” she says. Another time, her neighbour asked her friend Sue whether she’d heard from Rachel one day. “I heard that Darren was dragging that wheelie bin down the steps at 2am,” he told her. “Clearly, he thought I was in the wheelie bin,” says Rachel. But no one said anything to Darren, who was “a force to be reckoned with” and had “fingers in pies and I never knew what he was up to,” she says. “His bedtime reading was Donnie Brasco, Al Capone, the Krays.” I t was about 7.30am on 9 July 2011 when Rachel finally reached her limit. She had got into an argument with Darren the night before, after he had arrived home in the early hours of the morning, and she had been on her way out of the house to style hair for a wedding. He strangled her downstairs by the kitchen door so hard she squealed “like a pig”. It woke up the children, who were 20 and 16 respectively. Josh, the eldest, came running down the stairs doing a silent 999 call, while Jack held a baseball bat. “When he saw the kids, he let go, then he started crying and everything else – they like to become the victim.” After a while the kids went to bed, but Darren dragged Rachel up the stairs and threatened to slit his own wrists. Jack came back into the room as Darren scrambled through a drawer of hunting knives, and watched him slash his skin superficially. That was the moment she knew – “I have got to get out of this,” says Rachel. On average, victims experience 50 incidents of abuse and take seven failed attempts to leave before they go for good. Luckily, Rachel had always worked: she cleaned the doctor’s surgery before her day started, she had a mobile hairdressing business, and did shifts at a salon. She didn’t have savings but knew she would cope, and had already thought about getting a flat. She has always been close to her mum, and had a small but close-knit circle of friends to rely on. “At the end of the day, it’s great having a network,” she says, “but ultimately it’s on the victim-slash-survivor that’s got to say, ‘Right, I’m going to do this.’” At the point of leaving, though, “you just have tunnel vision”. My son clearly felt shame from it. That’s the problem with domestic violence – it’s a ripple effect But leaving still felt insurmountable. “At one point, I did think the only way out was suicide.” She drove down to Amroth Beach, “but something came over me where I just thought: I am not taking my life because of him.” Darren had always said to her: “There’s only one way out and that’s in a wooden box,” and she didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. A few days later, she had a solicitors appointment and filed for divorce. She went to the police station and gave a historical statement, in which she disclosed the most recent strangulation. Darren was charged with common assault. The sentence for that is no more than six months in prison, but more often than not, it is suspended or a fine. “This is why I pushed for non-fatal strangulation,” says Rachel, who petitioned to have it added to the Domestic Violence Act of 2022. “He may as well have slapped me in the face or spat.” Rachel wants the courts to do more when it comes to charging perpetrators: “If that was done to a stranger in the street, they would have probably had the five years it can carry,” she says. In the domestic abuse setting, strangulation is most often carried out as an act of “power and control. The perpetrator will grab you by the throat, put pressure on – you only need the pressure of a handshake to kill somebody.” Professor Catherine White, whose research was used as evidence to change the law regarding non-fatal strangulation, says it restricts oxygen to the brain and can cause internal bleeding so that victims can die a few days later. It is thought to be the second biggest cause of stroke in women under 40 . And women who have been strangled, throttled or choked are seven times more likely to be a victim of homicide. Darren was given a restraining order that meant he wasn’t allowed to come within three miles of the marital home. However, he continued to use the gym nearby. He started stalking Rachel: sitting outside her place of work in his Land Rover and staring at her for half an hour. “I’d phone the police and say, ‘He’s outside again,’ and they’d ask if he was doing anything.” It made her feel like a nuisance. “Nobody was confirming this is a dangerous pattern of behaviour,” says Rachel. The day before the shooting, all the bail restrictions were lifted by a lay magistrate, even though he had made threats to kill, had a conviction for firearms, and was a serial perpetrator. The police themselves came to warn her, and offered to install a panic room in her house. They added two metal brackets and a metal bar to her doors in case he came to the home. Rachel: ‘We have a criminal justice system that is broken, shattered. It needs to be started again.’ Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian The horror didn’t end with Darren shooting her in the salon that summer’s day. Once Rachel was discharged from hospital in September, her 16-year-old son Jack took his life. They had been very close: “He was like my shadow,” she says. But he had spiralled after his mother’s attempted murder and his father’s death. He had gone to the salon to apologise for his father’s actions, and was living with Darren’s family. He became overwhelmed. “Sixteen is a really impressionable age with his hormones and everything else,” she says. “He clearly felt shame from it.” That’s the problem with domestic violence, she adds: “It’s a ripple effect.” For the last decade, Rachel has campaigned tirelessly to end domestic abuse, which she describes as “a national emergency”. She hopes to set up The House that Jack Built, a children and young person’s refuge, in memory of her son. “We should be training everybody around domestic abuse and violence,” she says, teaching young boys and girls about what a healthy relationship is. She wants restraining orders to be taken seriously and see perpetrators face repercussions for their abuse. “We have a criminal justice system that is broken, shattered. It needs to be started again.” Rachel had to deal with the emotional torture of losing her son, as well as a tremendous amount of physical pain as a result of the abuse she faced. Her house had to be fitted with a commode and a new toilet seat to help during her recovery, but when her mum suggested putting in a stairlift as well, Rachel told her not to dare: “I will get up those stairs,” she said, “if I’ve got to go up on my ass.” Her mindset was: “I’m not staying like that.” Rachel’s attitude to dating was the same. She met her new husband Mike in November, the year she was shot, and he’s been the rock that she needed. “My attitude was, I’m not going to let someone ruin the rest of my life,” she says.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/16/on-a-sunny-day-my-ex-came-to-the-hair-salon-where-i-worked-and-shot-me-at-close-range,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cc7891f0141bc643920d0bd0b0c0f24dd90b06/672_0_4065_3253/master/4065.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a1683861138813c370c08e281b33db4",2025-10-16T04:00:57+00:00,d2dc506e6a5b604d2e0ccefc23f7e2874122a440
b0390d89dce9,"Proposed UK cuts to global aid fund could lead to 300,000 preventable deaths, say charities",,"The UK is expected to slash its contribution to a leading aid fund combating preventable diseases, with charities warning this could lead to more than 300,000 otherwise preventable deaths. If confirmed, the anticipated 20% cut in the UK contribution to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, would be announced on the sidelines of next month’s G20 summit in South Africa, which Keir Starmer is due to attend. Aid groups said such a reduction, on top of a 30% cut to the UK contribution at the previous funding round for the group three years ago, would further risk years of progress in combating the disease after Donald Trump slashed US aid . While no decision has been publicly announced before the Global Fund’s “replenishment” summit, covering 2027-29, aid groups say a proposed reduction in UK funding from £1bn to £800m is being widely discussed by senior government officials. If confirmed, it would follow a 25% reduction in UK money towards another aid organisation seen as being highly efficient in saving lives, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). The eventual £1.25bn commitment over five years to Gavi was nonetheless higher than many aid agencies had feared. The Switzerland-based Global Fund is credited with helping to save tens of million of lives in combating the three diseases. One aid agency estimated a £200m cut could lead to up to 340,000 avoidable deaths and nearly 5.9 million avoidable infections over the three-year funding period. Gareth Jenkins, an executive director at Malaria No More UK, said: “The world stands on the brink of a malaria resurgence, which will be so much more likely triggered if the UK makes a cut to its contribution to the Global Fund. “In this scenario many more children will lose their lives, health systems will be overwhelmed and economies dragged down – with huge knock-on effects for UK trade and health security.” Mike Podmore, the chief executive of StopAids, said the cut “would send a terrible message”, particularly as the UK is officially co-hosting next month’s funding event. Podmore said: “Not only did the UK already make a 30% cut three years ago, but to date no host has ever reduced their commitment from their previous pledge. This would represent a serious lack of leadership and undermine the UK’s reputation and soft power.” Adrian Lovett, the UK head of the development campaign One, said the cut would “put at risk decades of progress in the fight against Aids, TB and malaria – and as diseases do not stop at borders, it would jeopardise our own health security here at home too”. Monica Harding, the Liberal Democrats’ international development spokesperson, said cutting funding as co-host would be “an indictment of our global leadership in diplomacy and development”. She said: “Stepping back now and reducing our contribution to the fund at a time when the United States is abandoning vaccination programmes wholesale would be devastating to some of the world’s most vulnerable people. It would risk undoing much of the progress we have made in the global fight against disease.” The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/proposed-uk-cuts-global-aid-fund-preventable-deaths-charities,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be3310af5d4efaeacf93d8911b0c9530bb566cf/0_0_4589_3670/master/4589.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50773b39d88aa1328602aee9f147ab3c",2025-10-16T07:16:04+00:00,febb66c9272758c64f052917ab393404364c2ba1
776c35cefc7b,Australians took more than $1.4bn from their super last year for everything from weight loss to dental work,,"Australians withdrew more than $1.4bn from their superannuation accounts for compassionate reasons in the last financial year, with much of that used to fund medical procedures ranging from dental work to weight loss treatments. Of the 112,400 applications in 2024-25 for compassionate super access, 93,500 were made on medical grounds, up from 71,900 the year prior. There was a particularly sharp rise in applications to use superannuation to fund dental services, with the number doubling in two years to 32,875 requests. To be approved, medical services need to be certified by two practitioners and need to be deemed medically necessary to alleviate acute or chronic pain, to treat a life-threatening illness or injury, or to alleviate acute or chronic mental illness. Sign up: AU Breaking News email But the chief executive officer of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), Justin Untersteiner, said “some businesses and practitioners are taking advantage of this process to push overly expensive or unnecessary treatments”. “There is an inherent trust that the community places in their practitioners and taking advantage of people in need is never acceptable,” he said. “Any advice on what procedure is necessary should be based on the patients’ best interest and not influenced by financial gain or incentives.” The deputy commissioner of the ATO, Emma Rosenzweig, said health practitioners and registered agents were inappropriately helping people to access superannuation for cosmetic procedures in particular, which did not meet compassionate release requirements. “I want to make it clear, compassionate release of super should only be considered as a last resort, where all other options of paying for the eligible expenses have been exhausted,” she said. Ahpra and the Dental and Medical Boards of Australia on Thursday released guidance for doctors and dentists in response to ongoing concerns of inappropriate conduct around encouraging people to access superannuation. It includes a warning for practitioners that providing financial advice without a licence could result in severe penalties from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. “We are seeing practitioners making inaccurate statements in medical reports,” Rosenzweig said. “The ATO relies on medical and dental professionals to act in the best interests of their patients to prepare accurate reports regarding their diagnoses and the required treatment strategy.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

7f78a1ec1d6b,‘Damning’ review of anti-Black racism within Met police ‘buried’ by force,,"A review of anti-Black racism within the Metropolitan police has been “buried” by the force, despite finding discrimination “baked into its HR systems”, the Guardian can reveal. The internal review, commissioned by the Met from the consultancy HR Rewired, concluded that bias, racial stereotyping and inequity were woven through the force’s recruitment, promotion and grievance processes, affecting Black staff specifically. The review’s report, 30 Patterns of Harm: a Structural Review of Systemic Racism within the London Metropolitan Police Service, warned that the Met’s ambition to become an “anti-racist organisation” was being undermined by its own internal culture. The review found that performance systems rewarded familiarity over fairness, with Black staff given coded feedback such as “not quite ready” or “be a bit friendlier” and penalised for naming racism, seen as a “reputational risk”. Complaints of racism were often recast as “banter” or personality clashes, protecting perpetrators and leaving those who spoke up accused of “playing the race card” or being “too sensitive”. The three-month review ran from May to July 2025. A companion guide was also produced, but neither has been published. It comes two years after Louise Casey’s review , commissioned after the murder of Sarah Everard, which found the Met “institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic” but treated racism as part of a wider cultural collapse. By contrast, the HR Rewired review describes anti-Black racism as “baked into institutional design” and diagnoses the Met’s HR (human resources) systems themselves as part of the problem. The Met promised a two-year follow-up to assess progress since the Casey review; this was due in March 2025 but has not materialised. Casey’s report called for external expertise in assisting with reform, which led, in part, to HR Rewired’s appointment after further internal concerns about the force’s London race action plan, which was unveiled in 2024 , and plummeting confidence in the force among minority communities. The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has repeatedly denied over the years that the force is institutionally racist. Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters The revelation comes two weeks after a BBC Panorama investigation exposed serving Met officers making racist and misogynistic remarks . In response, the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, wrote to the home secretary pledging renewed efforts to tackle discrimination and referencing recent “significant progress” that the Met had made on race. Yet the report by HR Rewired suggests that the culture of bias extends across the organisation, including within the HR department responsible for fairness and accountability. Over the years, Rowley has repeatedly denied that the Met is institutionally racist. “Anti-Black outcomes in policing are not random. They have been built in,” the report says. “The Met is not asked to simply strengthen its response to harm, but to fundamentally reorient its system to interrupt harm before it occurs.” Sources said the document was circulated among senior leaders in July 2025, yet no public acknowledgment or reform plan had followed despite internal discussions. Senior Met figures were understood to be concerned about how the findings would be received. An insider with direct knowledge of the review told the Guardian: “If the leadership truly believed in reform, this would’ve been public long ago. Instead, it’s been buried.” This review is thought to be the first internal inquiry commissioned by the Met to examine anti-Black racism in its structures, rather than being prompted by individual tragedies or scandals, such as the MacPherson report (1999) that called the Met “institutionally racist” after officers’ mishandling of the Stephen Lawrence case. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association, said he had been told the review was ‘very damning’. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association ( NBPA ), said he was aware the review had been conducted. “I heard about it in August, approached the Met police for a copy in September – but a member of the senior leadership team refused to share it with the NBPA and said it’s only being shared with senior management,” he said. George said he had been told the review was “very damning” and had upset at least one senior officer. “The Met is continually trying to suppress anything that doesn’t fit in with the commissioner’s narrative that things are improving,” he said. Lawrence Davies, a lawyer at Equal Justice Solicitors, has represented several race discrimination tribunal claims against the Met. He said the findings proved institutional racism in the Met had deepened. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “The commissioner has been clear that we have much more to do to tackle the systemic, cultural, leadership and regulatory failings that have allowed racism and other forms of discrimination to put down deep roots in the Met. “That’s why we appointed Dr Shereen Daniels as our expert adviser, to help us confront difficult truths and guide meaningful change. “Recently, the Met’s senior leaders engaged in a detailed discussion of the report. To ensure we give this the time, care and attention it deserves, we have begun sharing the report with both internal and external partners. Once we have gathered feedback from these wider stakeholders, we remain fully committed to publishing the report, upholding our principles of transparency and accountability. “We want the Met to be an actively anti-racist organisation and this work builds on our drive to remove unsuitable officers and staff – the biggest corruption clear-out in British policing history.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/16/review-anti-black-racism-metropolitan-police-force-london,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fca3e8c9f622c97fc19b4392a2f945a1035bbc7/207_1216_2959_2367/master/2959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06c4b0d6af2ab88b052c70d417bff55c",2025-10-16T07:00:03+00:00,40a92222af861ff914ed7c3bec6bde79e3b02571

c9347d618ad8,England have their best chance of winning World Cup since 1970 – and Tuchel is the key,,"We’re on our way. We are Tom’s 26. This time, more than any other time, this time. We’re going to find a way. Find a way to get it right. This time. Well, maybe. Next time is also good. And the time after that. You don’t like this time? We have other times. Hey, Spain are pretty good right now aren’t they. There is an entire multilayered history of Englishness in the basic tone and mood of English World Cup excitement. It is easy to forget that when the 1982 squad, AKA Ron’s 22, released the song This Time, a tortured paean to finally erasing their own ancestral agony, England had actually won the World Cup only 16 years earlier. This was like Spain winning it in 2010 and then doing a song next year saying, oh, finally, finally we’re going to assuage our endless generational failure. To be fair, Ron’s 22 did a brilliantly authentic job of it, faces set with funereal dignity, belting out their V‑necked Viking death hymn. But then, the English are born to feel this. It’s the safe space: wounded lions, comfort in longing, failure as epic drama, thwarted greatness as a form of national identity. Through corned beef fumes on the quays of Mexico City, to rage at Gareth Southgate for providing actual, tangible hope, because hope is the one thing they’ll never forgive you for, this has been the tone. It has also been the most beautiful part of England football, more deeply cherished than actually doing well in 1990, or just accepting that maybe we’re not very good and need to work out a way to coach and play. It is important to state all this again now England have qualified with great efficiency for the tournament next year in the US, Mexico and Canada. If only because it makes Thomas Tuchel’s job description – win the World Cup or fail – seem less like a doomed mission and more a simple truth. Let’s face it, this has been the case for every England manager, even when success has been a much more distant prospect. And right now, pragmatically, logically, England have their best chance of winning a World Cup since 1970. Thomas Tuchel is trying to bring a sense of clarity to England’s preparations. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters This is not just a patriotic take. For the first time England are led by someone who has both won the Champions League and managed in the domestic top tier. The players are good. They seem unencumbered by the task. It doesn’t really matter if Tuchel’s England haven’t faced any top teams yet. These players come up against elite opponents every week in a global league. We know what Kevin De Bruyne looks like. It’s still hard. But it’s not scary any more. Forget the heat chat too, which belongs to a previous era of don’t drink the water and the food is all muck . To suggest the pressing Tuchel employs is possible only in cold weather is to misunderstand what pressing is, to see it as running constantly as opposed to triggers, controlled traps and keeping the ball in between. Spain, Germany and Deschamps‑era France have taken up four of the past eight World Cup final spots, all European teams that play a pressing game. Tuchel’s tactics speak to the dominant culture, to the way Chelsea pressed Paris Saint-Germain into the turf in New Jersey in July. This is also not an overreaction to results in qualifying. All of the other teams in Group K were terrible. But England still looked hungry, serious and happy to be there. Outside of one end-of-term defeat by Senegal the record over the past year reads played nine and won nine, with nine clean sheets. No one will fancy facing this England team right now. Tuchel would do well to emulate Didier Deschamps’ France team. Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP It is important to remember that Tuchel is the key to this. International football is a throwback in many ways. We are accustomed to the idea of managers having some kind of “philosophy”. Success is a process: banana bread, bald men with iPads, adherence to the famed Benelux school of the blitz-rage counter-swarm. In international football the manager is just as important, but leadership is the opposite thing. It’s about clarity, about taking things away more than adding them. Southgate got this, but was still in love with the quest, still talked about fighter pilots a lot, still saw his role as crawling, Shawshank-style, through an eight‑year tunnel of shit. Tuchel seemed puzzled by this at first. Here is a man whose life has been the overthinking of football, asked now to contemplate clarity, simple stuff, underthinking. He has, though, worked it out in real time, aided by the hugely underrated virtue of not actually seeming to want the job that much. Their tactics are simple: defend as a unit, attack at speed. Even better, not since Fabio Capello have England had a manager so clear the job will not define him. Where Capello also had the key demerits of being tactically outmoded and not speaking English, which was in effect like being managed by a very angry tailor’s mannequin, Tuchel has a bracing fearlessness, the sense that this is simply an interesting project, unafraid to dish it out to fans , players, hacks, his predecessor. It is at this point the omission of star players raises its head, a point of strength, but also something that needs to be managed and understood. As long ago as 1982 the video for This Time was dominated by closeups of Kevin Keegan’s hammy, sombre face, the unfit star who would ultimately prove just a distraction, and separately of Noel Edmonds, perfectly primped and hair-sprayed, with that familiar celebrity helicopter gunship salesman energy . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: BBC Pictures Archives This has always been an English vice. Losing the run of yourself when confronted with actual talent, jamming every famous face into the team, convinced your star players are magic buttons, that to be English and good is to make the world kneel before you, to carry the Ark of the Covenant into battle. This is where Tuchel’s approach is both interesting and also an act of pragmatism. It may feel exhilarating to omit the semi‑fit fancy boys, Jude, Phil, Jack, Trent, to embrace this as an act of performative hair shirt-ism. We are the humblest. We are exceptionally unexceptional. But this is not grandstanding. It is just good sense. Tuchel is doing this because England have an overload of No 10s and they only need one, and a choice of inside forwards. But the door is not closed. There is still plenty of time for Jude Bellingham , for example, to return with a clear role in a functioning unit. A disciplined Bellingham would be a huge bonus for Tuchel. But only, as has been the mantra to this point, when the team demands it. Another advantage: Tuchel knows where his players rank in the elite tier. To win a World Cup England will need to beat a combination of Spain, France, Argentina, Portugal, Belgium and others. The real point, and the nub of every tournament, is that they will need to beat teams who keep the ball and who have players just as skilful as their own stars. The only way to do this is to have a system that is balanced, that has no snags or celebrity bodge-jobs. Tuchel is concerned about England’s lack of a quality stand-in for Harry Kane. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images Again this is where realism comes into it, and why Tuchel is not playing mind games when he says England are outsiders. They lack a really high‑grade midfielder, central defender, left-back and a stand-in for Harry Kane, although the use of Elliot Anderson in one of those spots looks like an excellent fix. A good starting team would look something like: Pickford; James, Guéhi, Stones, Livramento; Rice, Anderson; Saka, Eze, Gordon; Kane. Adam Wharton has a chance still, although Tuchel seems to have doubts about his physical capacities. Cole Palmer is the only star player worth making a real exception for, because he is just so good in that 10 role and so suited to the tempo of the game. Otherwise England also need to think about non-Kane goals. Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Anthony Gordon and Jarrod Bowen have 59 caps and six goals combined. Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and Bellingham have 14 in 128 games. Why don’t you play all your stars? Because they haven’t been great. There have been only manageable tasks to this point. The real outcome will be defined next summer by the finest margins in some steel-and-glass megadrome, when the stitches pull, the tiny details merge into a single narrative, and victory either happens or it doesn’t. Stripping away how that is going to work, putting aside last time, thinking only of this time, is Tuchel’s key note of progress. As the manager wields his razor, the most England can hope for is a World Cup that comes down simply to how good you are, which would be a kind of triumph in itself.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/16/england-thomas-tuchel-world-cup-2026-finals-tournnament,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af558d56d40caed33fbbafff0c643d2f212f81a3/556_0_2579_2064/master/2579.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06f2f03f0e66f348bcba9fa12e3a48fd",2025-10-16T07:00:02+00:00,10309bd477cc7a988d4db519d1bf2f07c62de8b4
46507ec983d9,Premier League clubs turn to hidden gambling partners to beat sponsorship ban,,"E leven Premier League clubs will have to find new principal sponsors next season when the ban on front-of-shirt advertising for betting companies takes effect. This will represent a financial blow for the clubs concerned: gambling operators are known to pay a substantial premium on standard industry rates. As Karren Brady told the House of Lords in a debate on the football governance bill last November, “the typical difference between gambling and non-gambling shirt sponsorships is around 40%”. The vice-chair of West Ham warned: “For some Premier League clubs, this decision [to ban front-of-shirt gambling advertising] will mean a reduction of around 20% of their total commercial revenues.” So how to make for the shortfall? Some clubs seem to have opted for the simplest of solutions: to carry on as before, by adapting the nature of their offer to gambling partners accordingly, which includes hidden partnership deals with Asian-facing operators that are unlicensed in the UK and target illegal markets in China, and south and east Asia. The clubs concerned are Sunderland, Aston Villa, Leeds, Nottingham Forest and Chelsea. There will still be advertising space to be sold at a premium as the ban in question will be limited to the fronts of shirts. It will remain possible, for instance, to display the names of gambling brands on shirt sleeves and on the LED perimeter boards which surround the stadiums. Until recently, deals with Asian-facing operators were off the table if they had no regulatory status in the UK. Consequently, those bookmakers used so-called white label companies, such as the Isle of Man-based TGP Europe, to register UK domain names with the Great Britain Gambling Commission (GBGC). But TGP Europe exited the British market after the GBGC hit them last May with a £3.3m fine for multiple breaches of anti-money laundering regulations. Other white label agents followed suit. This would normally have meant that any form of advertisement for these operators would no longer be allowed in Britain. Yet those operators are still part of the Premier League’s ecosystem. West Ham United vice-chair Karren Brady has said the crackdown will cost clubs about 20% of their commercial revenues. Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP Clubs were prompt in seizing on an opening which was given to them by the GBGC, which appears to have changed its stance on the conditions that must be met by clubs to enter into commercial relationships with unlicensed operators. This was made clear in a letter sent in May by the GBGC to four Premier League clubs – Bournemouth, Fulham, Wolves and Newcastle – plus Burnley, then in the Championship, who had been partners of TGP Europe-registered operators. Clubs are now required only to satisfy themselves that their partners are not accepting bets in sterling or from UK customers, and that their websites are geo-blocked in Britain. There is, however, a sting in the tail. “We would advise that any organisation engaging in sponsorship from brands that do not hold a commission licence manage their exposure to risk,” the GBGC said. “This includes satisfying themselves as to the source of the funds for the arrangement.” And that is – or should be – problematic, as the identity of the ultimate beneficial owners of Asian-facing betting companies is a mystery which has eluded clubs, law enforcement agencies and regulators ever since those multiple brands emerged in the 2000s and 2010s. Yet this has not prevented clubs such as Burnley (96.com), Sunderland (W88), Wolves (DeBet), Fulham (SBOTOP) and Crystal Palace (Net88) from acquiring or retaining Asian-facing, UK-unlicensed operators as their main sponsors for one last season before the ban; but these partnerships are at least acknowledged and visible, and have only nine months to go at the most. This is not the case for another, new type of partnership that has taken root and that gives a taste of things to come in the post-ban Premier League. Sunderland, again, Leeds, Nottingham Forest and Chelsea have been promoting the Asian-facing 8Xbet (a former partner of Manchester City among others) on the perimeter boards of their stadiums at every home game since the start of the season, with Chelsea being the only of the four to acknowledge their relationship with the bookmaker on their website. Villa’s hidden partner is Nova88, “the best online casino in Malaysia”, which claims to be licensed in Tobique, a Canadian First Nation reservation (sports betting is illegal in Malaysia). The partnership was announced in a pre-season statement by the club, but the name of the “Official Asian Betting Partner” of Villa does not appear in their website’s list of partners. Similarly, while Chelsea do not hide their relationship with 8Xbet, their partnership with another Asian-facing bookmaker, Kaiyun, is only visible when accessing the club’s website from some Asian jurisdictions. The clubs’ reluctance to acknowledge publicly commercial relationships with Asian-facing operators is understandable. There is a reputational risk involved. Though none of the companies partnering with Premier League clubs have been named directly, multiple recent reports, by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Asian Racing Federation in particular, have highlighted the links between illegal Asian-facing online sports betting platforms, scamming, human trafficking and cyber slavery in the region. The operators themselves do not care if the British public is unaware of their relationship with English clubs, as what matters to them is how their Asian customer base is exposed to their brands when watching Premier League games. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All sports betting advertising has been banned in La Liga since the end of the 2020-21 season, yet almost all of its clubs, including Real Madrid (Kaiyun) and Atlético Madrid (Leyu and K8), have turned to hidden partnerships and signed deals with Asian-facing betting operators since then. Spanish fans will not be aware of this; no more than English fans of Sunderland or Forest are aware of their club’s links to 8Xbet.

a18d3b3e08ba,Toronto Blue Jays bash five homers to rout Mariners and cut ALCS deficit,,"George Kirby was in the strike zone – perhaps too much. The Toronto Blue Jays had 18 hits, including five home runs, all within the first three pitches of an at-bat in a 13-4 rout of the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night that pulled them to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series. Eight of those hits came off Kirby, who hadn’t yielded that many hits in a start since 3 September. “I’m never going to stray away from what I do well, and that’s get ahead and be in the zone,” Kirby said. “And they had a lot of comfortable at-bats tonight.” Kirby gave up a tying, two-run homer to Andrés Giménez in a five-run third on an inside fastball and two-run double to Daulton Varsho on an up fastball. George Springer homered on a sinker in the fourth and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. on a slider in the fifth. Alejandro Kirk added an opposite-field, three-run homer to right off a fastball from left-hander Caleb Ferguson in the sixth as the Blue Jays joined Tampa Bay in Game 4 of the 2020 World Series as the only teams to homer in four straight postseason innings, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Addison Barger connected in the ninth on a Luke Jackson fastball. “When a lineup starts combining hits together like they were, it gets contagious,” Ferguson said. “Guys go up there and just get the best swings off. So, a lot of times it goes your way, and tonight it went theirs.” Toronto had four runs and eight hits as Seattle swept the first two games in Canada. “I wasn’t really executing when they got the guys on base,” Kirby said. “They’re really aggressive when that happens.” Seattle’s pitchers were sixth in the AL with a 3.87 ERA and had a 3.29 ERA in the Division Series against Detroit. Ferguson expressed confidence they quickly will return to form. “If there’s one thing we’ve done since I’ve been here,” Ferguson said, “we bounce back together well as a team and we respond well when we kind of get smacked in the face a little bit.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/blue-jays-mariners-alcs-game-three,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fd47da7092e0abbc31a5a540e6891da3654119/0_0_2743_2195/master/2743.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7eebd153cd2b13e2c9da5ac235df09b7",2025-10-16T05:57:58+00:00,498483e8750b97d8a24055ba1c3bed2c5b659550

He said the chairs of the home affairs committee, the foreign affairs committee and the justice committee were among the committee’s members. He asked for an assurance that the inquiry would have access to ministers and officials. Ward said the government welcomed parliamentary scrutiny. He said he was sure witnesses would be made available to the committee. Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Asked why Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told MPs on Monday that Jonathan Powell, the PM’s national security adviser, was not linked to the pro-China 48 Grou p, when until recently he was listed on its website as a fellow, Ward said Powell “ was not involved in any part of this ”. Kieran Mullan (Con) asked why wording from the Labour manifesto was included in the final witness statement. Ward said that was there to provide “wider context”. But that wording was provided by the DNSA, without involvement from ministers or political advisers. Richard Tice , the Reform UK deputy leader, asked if the government regards China as a national security threat. Ward said the evidence shows that China poses a threat multiple times. Nick Timothy (Con) said the PM claimed that the relevant evidence related to the last government’s China policy. But the evidence was changed to reflect the current govermnment’s policy. He said this showed what the PM told MPs was wrong. Ward rejected that. He said there was no political intererence in the evidence. Richard Foord (Lib Dem) asked why the government did not request sight of the DNSA’s witness statements. He accused the government of delegating responsibility and accountability to a civil servant. Ward said the DNSA did set out the threat posed by China . Bernard Jenkin (Con) said it was “beyond belief” that nobody was able to tell the deputy national security adviser that he needed to give the CPS the evidence it needed. He went on: One can only conclude that this conspiracy of omission was something the government wanted, because they didn’t want this trial to go ahead. Ward rejected this argument. 'Who the hell's side are you on?' - Tom Tugendhat condemns Starmer for lack of leadership Tom Tugendhat , the Tory former security minister, said he felt very personally about this. My home has been broken into, my files have been ransacked. Somebody had been put in my office by a hostile state, and two parties are playing politics with it. This is national security of the United Kingdom. The elected people of Tonbridge chose me. They may have chosen wrong, but they did. The elected people of other parts of the United Kingdom chose everybody else in this house. It is up to them to choose who represents them. And yet here we have two individuals seeking to extract information from us, and the government’s response is not as mine was, do everything you can to make sure the prosecution works. But no – process, process. Well, who the hell’s side are you on? This isn’t about the bureaucracy. This is about leadership. We’re not sent here to be civil servants. We sent here to lead the country and to make decisions. Tugendhat said that Ward, a very new minister, had been sent out to “defend the indefensible”. He said Ward was sounding like a bureaucrat, not a politician. Previous attorneys general prosecuted on the state’s behalf. But this attorney general, and this PM, said “not on my watch”, Tugendhat said. Ward said that he had huge respect for Tugendhat and that he was “ genuinely not trying to play politics” with this. Government weakened case for spy prosecution by including references to China presenting economic opportunity, MPs told Jeremy Wright , a Tory former attorney general, asked why the witness statments mentioned China presenting an economic opportunity. What is the possible relevance of the inclusion of information about China as an economic opportunity? Surely the minister can see, and the government can see, that that only weakens the substance of the question that particular witness was being asked to answer. Ward said that the witness statement was providing the “broader context of the position of the government at the time in relation to the situation on China”. Edward Leigh (Con) asked for an assurance that there was no ministerial involvement in the CPS decision to drop the case. Ward replied: “That’s absolutely my understanding. ” Joint committee on national security strategy to hold inquiry into collapse of China spy trial, MPs told Matt Western , the Labour chair of the joint committee on national security strategy, said that his commitee met this morning and has decided to hold a formal inquiry into this. He said the chairs of the home affairs committee, the foreign affairs committee and the justice committee were among the committee’s members. He asked for an assurance that the inquiry would have access to ministers and officials. Ward said the government welcomed parliamentary scrutiny. He said he was sure witnesses would be made available to the committee. Jess Brown-Fuller , the Lib Dem spokesperson, called for a public inquiry into this affair. Ward said parliamentary committees would be looking at this. Emily Thornberry , the Labour chair of the foreign affairs committee, says as a lawyer she cannot understand why the CPS did not go ahead and put this case to a jury. In his response to O’Brien, Ward said that the Tories were at the same time accusing the government of improperly intervening in the prosecution process (to discourage prosection) – while at the same time saying the government should have intervened to ensure the prosecution went ahead. Tory MP Neil O'Brien claims witness statements show threat from China was made 'less clear' under Labour Neil O’Brien said he was shocked to hear yesterday that the PM knew two days in advance that the prosecution was going to be dropped, but did nothing. He said the government had to explain why it did not give the CPS the extra 5% it needed. And he said the witness statements showed that Labour policy was included in the submission. These additions made it ‘‘less clear” that China was a threat, he said. He called for the publication of all the documents relevant to this case. He asks what the government has got to hide. Ward says the witness statements show that the evidence submitted by the deputy national security adviser “ does not change materially throughout”.

d604bc008b82,Reform UK accused of sowing division in Wales in rowdy TV byelection debate,,"Reform UK has been accused of sowing division over immigration in the south Welsh valleys constituency of Caerphilly before next week’s crucial Senedd byelection. During a fiery candidates’ debate, Nigel Farage’s party was criticised for using immigrants to score political points rather than treating them as individuals. An audience member said that people like her who had someone not born in the UK in her family no longer felt welcome in the area since Reform had arrived to campaign and had advised her sons to avoid certain places. A new poll, released on Thursday, suggested Reform was leading the race in the byelection for the Welsh parliament seat, with 42% of people saying they would support the party, followed by Plaid Cymru (38%), with Labour trailing on 12% and the Tories on 4%. If the poll proves accurate, it would be a huge blow to Labour, which has always held the Caerphilly Senedd and Westminster seats and currently runs the Welsh government. A previous poll suggested the party could also be pushed into third place in next year’s full Senedd elections. Six of the candidates standing in the byelection went head-to-head in a rowdy BBC Wales television debate at Bedwas Workmen’s Hall and Institute. Topics ranged from library closures proposed by the Labour-run local authority to the state of the NHS in Wales, for which Welsh Labour is repeatedly criticised. But the most intense exchanges came over immigration with the Reform candidate, Llŷr Powell, pressed over why the party was focusing so much on the topic when, according to the last census, only 2.9% of people in Caerphilly were born outside the UK. Powell said the figure was out of date and more people had arrived under what he called the “Boriswave” . He said: “If you go outside of Caerphilly … you can see there is pressures there. We’re having a housing crisis. I’m not saying it’s all bad. We need to get back to controlling migration.” Powell was challenged by an audience member about the impact Reform’s rhetoric was having on her own family. She said a member of the family was among the 2.9% and told him: “I have never felt so unwelcome in my own home town as I do since your party came into Caerphilly with all the rhetoric you bring in. I have to say to my sons please don’t go there. Please don’t do this. I blame you for that.” Powell replied that he spoke about immigration “as a policy”. She replied: “We’re not policies, you’re talking about human beings. You don’t treat them like human beings.” The Labour candidate, Richard Tunnicliffe, said immigration was being “weaponised”. He said: “Reform don’t want to fix it, they just want to sow division and fear.” Lindsay Whittle, the Plaid candidate, said he would be “proud” to continue to support the Welsh government’s nation of sanctuary policy, which provides support for refugees . Reform has said it will scrap the scheme. Whittle said Ukrainian people in the area were living in fear of being sent back. Referring to the conviction of the former Reform UK leader in Wales, Nathan Gill , of bribery charges relating to statements made in favour of Russia in the European parliament, Whittle said: “Whilst they were fleeing bombs and bullets thrown at them by the Russians the Reform leader [in Wales] was accepting bribes from the Russians.” Powell, who used to work for Gill, said he was “utterly shocked” at what his former boss had done. “He should face the full weight of the law. It’s traitorous.” The new poll, carried out by Survation, found support for Reform stronger among older people while Plaid was doing better among younger people. Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of Survation, which conducted the poll, said Welsh politics was on the cusp of an unprecedented transformation, adding: “While Labour’s 100-year unbeaten record in Caerphilly’s Senedd and Westminster elections is highly likely to be coming to an end, this type of result be replicated nationally will also see the end of over 20 years of Labour Welsh government dominance, with Reform or Plaid the likely party of power in 2026.”",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/reform-uk-accused-of-sowing-division-in-wales-in-rowdy-tv-byelection-debate-caerphilly,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79242ce748ee55e2eb8794f70e43d656b3bfeb38/193_79_3213_2571/master/3213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43e4a1363632465f61c2ec1d96df77a2",2025-10-16T09:05:57+00:00,3b71b34045f1c825fb29dcd230964f03f4ae39a8
bcc015341e5f,‘Inherently cruel’: Canadian parents say citizenship bill erodes rights of children adopted abroad,,"Canadian parents of children adopted abroad say a proposed citizenship bill represents a “shocking and unconscionable” erosion of their children’s rights by the governing Liberals. The federal government is in the midst of overhauling the Citizenship Act so Canadians born abroad can pass citizenship to further generations born abroad. The bill would also restore or grant citizenship descendants who were excluded under older citizenship laws. But Kat Lanteigne, whose adopted son was born in Zambia, said a new requirement that a Canadian child born abroad demonstrate a “substantial connection” to Canada treats adopted children like immigrants. “It doesn’t treat our son like the Canadian citizen that he is,” she said. In 2009, changes were made to Canada’s citizenship laws that stopped the automatic transmission of citizenship by descent to foreign-born children if both of their Canadian parents were also born in a foreign country. The rule was struck down by an Ontario court in 2023 and Mark Carney’s Liberal government have proposed legislation that purports to fix elements of the law that were deemed to be unconstitutional. But Lanteigne said the proposed fix imposes a “connection test” that conflates children born outside Canada with children born outside Canada but adopted by Canadians within Canada. Government officials say as many as 2,000 children could be affected by the wording of the legislation. “We adopted our child from another country, but we actually adopted our child in the province of Ontario and in the country of Canada,” she said. “He doesn’t know any other nation except for his life in Canada.” Although elements of the bill have not yet been passed into law, Lanteigne says if her son were to move abroad and have children, he would, in theory, have to prove his “substantial connection” to Canada in order to pass citizenship on to any children. The connection test would not apply in similar circumstances to someone born in Canada. “Demanding an international adoptee, who has been adopted by Canadian families who live in Canada and granted citizenship by the Canadian government, go through a test that they really are Canadian is like asking them who their ‘real’ parents are. Not only is it deleterious and harmful to the international adoptee, it violates the international law that our country is signatory to,” she said. “It’s wholly unnecessary and inherently cruel.” The 1993 Hague convention on inter-country adoption says: “The [adopted] child shall enjoy in the receiving state, and in any other contracting state where the adoption is recognized, rights equivalent to those resulting from adoptions having this effect in each such state.” While all Canadian provinces and territories are in line with the convention, Lanteigne said Bill C-3 puts the federal government in breach. In early October, parliament’s standing committee on citizenship and immigration voted down an amendment from Liberal member Nathaniel Erskine-Smith that sought to fix the issue. Erskine-Smith told lawmakers “any inequality” between a child born in Canada and born abroad is “unconscionable”. The mood was at times tense at the committee after -Smith told experts he felt “absolutely misled” by their assessments of his amendments, neither of which passed. The first was withdrawn after Erskine-Smith was told the amendment logically “applied to no one” based on its wording and the second voted down by the committee despite the Liberals, which hold a minority of seats on the committee, all voting to support the amendment. Two conservative members on the committee raised concerns over the possibility that children adopted from abroad could be the victims of human trafficking. “Conflating child trafficking with the quality of our son’s citizenship status is dog-whistle politics which has no place in this discussion,” Lanteigne said in a letter addressed to the Tory lawmakers. “My Canadian son’s citizenship rights are not fodder for partisanship or xenophobic rhetoric.” In Canada, citizenship is granted to children from abroad at the end of the adoption process – a protracted bureaucratic process that takes years. Erskine-Smith and Lanteigne pointed to laws in the UK which treat children adopted internationally as if they had been born in the UK to a British citizen parent, meaning they can pass on British citizenship to any children they have. “Our child is a 16th-generation Acadian whose ancestors built Acadia, served at Vimy Ridge and Dieppe , and his charter rights must be protected by our legislators,” said Lanteigne. “The fact that he was born in another nation should have no bearing on the quality and consideration of his citizenship status.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/canada-citizenship-bill-children-adopted-abroad,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3057318886f61d3d6cab2565561ac91abf7d8509/384_0_3840_3072/master/3840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3545c151028892b7f7749c92d45c5e70",2025-10-16T10:00:04+00:00,a35a235a3e1593bdf691cadfd118de07823ba8e0
2f80e835878e,Three Australians accused of premeditated murder in Bali villa could face the death penalty,,"Three Australians accused of shooting a Melbourne man in a Bali villa are set to be charged with premeditated murder, an offence punishable by the death sentence. Melbourne man Zivan Radmanovic , 32, was fatally gunned down in the bathroom of Villa Casa Santisya near Munggu Beach, in Bali’s Badung district in June. Radmanovic’s partner Jazmyn reportedly hid under a blanket during the attack that occurred as the pair holidayed on the popular resort island, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. A second individual, Sanar Ghanim, a 34-year-old man from Melbourne, survived the attack. Police found 17 bullet casings and two intact bullets at the scene, while witnesses told investigators that two gunmen had arrived on a scooter at the villa around midnight. Three Australian men, Darcy Jenson, 27, Paea-I-Middlemore Tupou, 27, and Coskun Mevlut, 22, were subsequently arrested in relation to the case and in July were forced to re-enact the alleged shooting, a standard part of police investigations in Indonesia. One of the suspects was arrested at a Jakarta airport days after Radmanovic’s death, while the other two who had left Indonesia were returned via coordination from Interpol in south-east Asia, Bali police chief Insp. Gen. Daniel Adityajaya told reporters. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Public prosecutors in Bali said on Wednesday that the three men were suspected of committing premeditated murder in relation to Zivan Radmanovic, and attempted premeditated murder against Sanar Ghanim.

The prosecutor’s office did not specify in its notice on Wednesday when court proceedings would begin or the motive for the alleged murder. Badung police chief M.

The report by Sydney barrister Fiona Roughley SC, released Thursday , found there were “conflicts of interest” and “conflicted persons” within the Department of Parliamentary Services involved in the decision-making process. In Senate estimates hearings in 2024, the former DPS secretary Rob Stefanic said he declared a conflict of interest with Cate Saunders, his former deputy secretary, in August 2022, due to a “close” personal relationship. Saunders remained his subordinate for eight months until she was seconded to Services Australia, where she later accepted a $315,126 incentive payment for her retirement from the public service on 1 October 2023. The National Anti-Corruption Commission confirmed in March this year it was also conducting an investigation related to the subject matter of Roughley’s report. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Roughley’s report also found multiple procedural failures resulted in Saunders’ retirement payment deviating from public service guidance material, which “resulted in an increase in the quantum of the payment made”. The report highlighted additional concerns including the “exclusion”, “lack of involvement” and/or “disregard for the advice of specialist DPS payroll staff”. It also noted concerns about “excessive pressure applied on the timing of the payment”. The report made seven recommendations, including quarantining conflicted decision-makers from the process and documenting the reasons for making an offer. Stefanic told Senate estimates in 2024 that the working relationship between Saunders and himself was “transactional” after declaring a conflict of interest, and that his dealings with Saunders as her boss during that period were “purely administrative in nature”. The former long-serving secretary said he had formally declared a conflict of interest with Saunders due to “gossip” and “rumour” about their “close, personal” relationship. While the exit package was approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services, Stefanic told the hearing he was not involved in its signoff. The details arose across subsequent Senate estimates hearings. The DPS is not subject to freedom of information legislation. Stefanic stood down in December 2024 after a period of indefinite leave months after his position first came under intense scrutiny . The now DPS secretary, Jaala Hinchcliffe, ordered the independent review in July 2024, telling a November Senate estimates hearing there were no records of conversations Stefanic said he had with the presiding officers and the parliamentary services commissioner about the declared conflict of interest.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/conflicts-of-interest-behind-australian-parliamentary-officials-315k-retirement-payment-report-finds-ntwnfb,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/170ef3905e7ee50c8aa266e7ffde9a248b649563/137_0_6150_4920/master/6150.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dcd75e84097dacfc0c29274008868b13",2025-10-16T08:47:41+00:00,f444bae9bbfa617bc0bf83e3c063fc83c14be12c
c2278032b688,"From protest laws to deaths in custody, Minns’ rush to claim the conservative high ground is clumsy and costly",,"There is a lesson for Chris Minns in the NSW supreme court’s declaration that police powers to deal with protesters near places of worship are invalid: laws curtailing civil liberties should never be rushed. They should certainly not be pushed through in an atmosphere of panic and incomplete facts such as existed in the fevered days after the now notorious Dural caravan incident . Justice Anna Mitchelmore ruled on Thursday that the police powers impermissibly burdened the freedom of political communication implied in Australia’s constitution. Mitchelmore agreed with the Palestine Action Group that the laws were vague and could apply to any protest near a church or place of worship, regardless of whether the protest was addressed towards a religious community or focused on a place of worship. Some of the most popular places for protests in Sydney are near religious places: the town hall is next to St Andrew’s Anglican Cathedral; Hyde Park is across the road from the Great Synagogue on one side, and St Mary’s Catholic Cathedral on the other. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The laws as drafted meant that if a protester obstructed worshippers, even inadvertently, they could be in breach. The protest that was the catalyst for the laws was not against a religious event, but a speech held at the synagogue by a member of the Israel Defense Forces. Minns was warned by several lawyers in his caucus that the bill was too vague and probably unconstitutional. They were ignored. At almost every opportunity, Minns chooses a conservative path. It’s an approach that is straight out of the former premier Bob Carr’s playbook: get the cops on side and ensure there is absolutely no opportunity for the opposition to fault Labor’s toughness on crime, while playing to the cheer squad in the tabloid media, talkback radio and at Sky News. In the rush to claim the conservative position, Minns has made several embarrassing gaffes, including citing “700 instances of antisemitic attacks” over last summer, which subsequently proved to be inaccurate both in the number and nature of many of the incidents. I suspect the law-and-order drumbeat does not resonate so well with young people who get their news from sources other than the conservative media, or even commercial television. Worse still, this approach comes with costs over time. This week the NSW coroner, Teresa O’Sullivan, made a rare public comment about the 12 Indigenous deaths in custody this year, the highest number ever in a year. “This is a profoundly distressing milestone,” she said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

3c2bdc7bb3a4,Queensland’s 10-cent container refund scheme referred to crime and corruption commission,,"Ten allegations against Queensland’s container recycling scheme have been referred to the state’s corruption watchdog after a parliamentary inquiry on Thursday revealed allegations of bullying and conflicts of interest. A parliamentary committee revealed claims that the board coordinating the state’s Containers for Change is “dominated” by Coca-Cola and Lion, with several submissions to the inquiry claiming that the two beverage companies have an incentive to reduce the number of containers being recycled in order to lower their costs. Beverage companies pay a “scheme fee” funding both the 10-cent refund per container to consumers plus a six-cent rebate to the organisation which operates the depot or collection point. The “scheme fee” is dependent on the number of containers recycled. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The scheme is coordinated by the Container Exchange Limited (COEX), a not-for-profit organisation responsible for all elements of the scheme. In other states, the two responsibilities are split. Coca-Cola and Lion are represented on the COEX board. The arrangement “effectively handed monopoly control of the scheme to two of Australia’s largest beverage corporations,” the parliamentary committee’s report said. “Those corporations dominated the board, and awarded a key contract to their own joint venture,” the report said. The committee chair, Rob Molhoek, tabled the 273-page report on Thursday. He noted that 30 of 120 individuals and groups that made submissions to the inquiry requested anonymity. “We heard from whistleblowers and operators who described bullying, harassment and intimidation by COEX staff across multiple sites. There were also allegations that former employees manipulated markets to their benefit, securing new sites at the expense of existing operators,” he said. LNP members of the committee said they had made 10 referrals to the Queensland Crime and Corruption Committee as a result of the inquiry, but did not elaborate about what they were. Molhoek said the scheme turns over nearly half a billion dollars a year, “yet only 36% of this is returned to consumers, with less than 2% going to charities, schools, sporting clubs or community organisations”. The scheme had many millions of dollars in reserve, with no clear policy for spending it for environmental or charitable purposes, he said. The committee made 21 recommendations, largely to impose stricter oversight or to amend its governance model. The scheme was created in 2018 under Labor’s then-environment minister Steven Miles after an unsolicited proposal from several beverage companies. It has successfully increased the state’s beverage container recovery rate from 18% prior to the introduction of the scheme to 67.1% this year. Recycling advocates the Boomerang Alliance said the best container deposit schemes in Europe “have return rates above 90%” and that the state government should increase rebates to 20 cents and improve the network through more collection points. Queensland’s Labor opposition on Thursday cast doubt on the committee’s findings, saying it had “reservations that the report conflates certain feedback raised from stakeholders and sensationalises claims from certain stakeholders” and appeared “political in nature”. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners said it was “reviewing the report and its recommendations in detail”. A spokesperson for Lion said it was “proud of its role in establishing the Container Refund Scheme in Queensland – and indeed the entire network of similar schemes around the country”. “The scheme is funded entirely by, and at significant cost to, participating beverage industry participants like Lion,” the spokesperson said. “While we agree there is room for even better performance, we believe Queensland has a world-leading producer responsibility scheme which should be celebrated”. A spokesperson for COEX said Queensland’s Containers for Change scheme “ is one of Australia’s most successful recycling systems ”, with no Australian scheme achieving 85% recycling rates. The spokesperson said as the allegations of corruption have been referred to the CCC, “it would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter”.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/queenslands-10-cent-container-refund-scheme-referred-to-and-corruption-commission,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d0a46cf541893d4e45c5eaef87c7ed857b557f/474_0_4779_3824/master/4779.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f16d7bdef715ff0e660607ffdc45feb",2025-10-16T07:59:57+00:00,f7c3ac710b9667f54568b53b2c14dbf3986e7733
412bec111110,"Nestlé to axe 16,000 jobs as new chief targets sales growth",,"Nestlé has said it will cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years as the owner of KitKat and Nescafé attempts to reduce costs and increase sales. The Swiss-headquartered multinational said the cuts would include 12,000 white-collar professionals and 4,000 in its manufacturing and supply chain, close to 6% of Nestlé’s global workforce. “The world is changing and Nestlé needs to change faster,” said Philipp Navratil, the new chief executive. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount over the next two years. We will do this with respect and transparency.” Navratil, who replaced Laurent Freixe last month after he was fired for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a subordinate , announced an acceleration of his predecessor’s cost-saving plan to free up cash. The company, which owns a suite of consumer goods brands including Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, Nespresso coffee capsules and Purina cat food, will seek to make savings of SFr3bn (£2.8bn) by 2027, up from a previous target of SFr2.5bn. Freixe’s firing, which was followed two weeks later by the resignation of the chair, Paul Bulcke, destabilised Nestlé, already under pressure to bolster growth and reduce debt. “We will be bolder in investing at scale and driving innovation to deliver accelerated growth and value creation,” Navratil said. “We are fostering a culture that embraces a performance mindset, that does not accept losing market share, and where winning is rewarded.” The cuts were announced as the company reported a 1.9% year-on-year fall in sales to SFr65.9bn in the first nine months of the year. It said this was primarily due to negative foreign exchange impacts of 5.4% and that, on an organic basis, sales grew at 3.3%. “We have been stepping up investment to achieve this, and the results are starting to come through,” Navratil said. “Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum. “As Nestlé moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential returns.” However, the company said its higher sales were fuelled by inflationary pressures leading to price rises, with “double-digit percentage increases in some markets”. Sales growth was led by coffee and confectionery, where Nestlé has had to factor in higher coffee and cocoa costs . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

3efa09584d06,"Ricky Hatton is thought to have killed himself, inquest told",,"Ricky Hatton, the former world champion boxer who died in September, is believed to have killed himself, according to a provisional cause of death given at the opening of his inquest at Stockport coroner’s court. Hatton, 46, was found dead in his home on 14 September. News of his death caused an outpouring of grief across the world and thousands of people lined the streets for his funeral. His body was found in his home in Hyde after police received a call from a concerned neighbour, later revealed to have been his manager, Paul Speak, who alongside Hatton’s son and brother, was a pallbearer at his funeral. The former world champion had been open about his struggles with clinical depression and substance abuse, saying on one occasion that he “was coming off the rails” with his drink and drug use, describing himself previously as being “like a runaway train”. The police coroner’s officer Alison Catlow told the inquest Hatton was last seen by family members on Friday 12 September, when he seemed well and there was no cause for concern. The court heard that the next day Hatton did not appear at an event that he was scheduled to attend, and on the morning of Sunday 14 September Speak went to Hatton’s home in order to escort him to Manchester airport to fly to Dubai. When he didn’t get a response, Speak entered Hatton’s home, where he “found him unresponsive” . Speak called the emergency services, but Hatton was pronounced dead. The full inquest into Hatton’s death is scheduled to begin at Manchester south coroner court on 20 March 2026.

13cdef81a794,"Prosecutions director must explain why China spy case was dropped, says UK minister",,"The director of public prosecutions should explain why he felt he could not proceed with the trial of two men accused of spying for China, a government minister has said after No 10 published key evidence in an attempt to draw a line under the row. Stephen Kinnock said the government was “deeply disappointed that the prosecution didn’t go ahead” and that Stephen Parkinson was “the best person to explain” why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt the government’s evidence did not meet the bar. Kinnock’s comments, which were echoed by the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, ramp up pressure on the CPS over the sudden abandonment of the trial last month . Charges were dropped against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher to Kearns and Tom Tugendhat; and Christopher Berry, a teacher, after the CPS said the government had not provided evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”. Cash and Berry have denied any wrongdoing. Following accusations that they interfered with the trial to protect the UK’s trading relationship with China, ministers published the three witness statements submitted to prosecutors by the deputy national security adviser, Matthew Collins, late on Wednesday. In his statements, written in 2023 and 2025, Collins wrote that Beijing’s intelligence agencies “conduct large scale espionage operations” which “harm the interests and security of the UK” and “threaten the UK’s economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions”. Asked whether this demonstrated that the error rested with the CPS, Kinnock told Sky News: “I believe the DPP told MPs yesterday that he felt the evidence was 95% of the way there, but there was a 5% gap that was missing. I think he’s the best person to explain what that 5% that was missing was.”’ He stressed that claims Labour deliberately collapsed the trial were “patently nonsense” and that ministers believed a major reason it did not go ahead was “the abject failure of the previous government to update the legislation”. Kearns said she would be questioning Parkinson on Thursday on why prosecutors did not push ahead with the trial. “In my view the CPS should have proceeded with this and that’s a discussion I will have with the DPP when I see him today for the first time,” she told the BBC Radio 4 programme. Kearns added that “when the government was informed the case was at risk they had a duty to take action”. Downing Street revealed on Wednesday that Keir Starmer was informed that the case was on the brink of collapse days before the CPS announced it, but insisted it was not for him to intervene in the matter. The controversy has turned the spotlight on the espionage activities carried out by China’s intelligence services. On Wednesday, Dominic Cummings, who served as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, claimed he and the prime minister were briefed in 2020 that China had breached secure high-level systems involving Strap material, a security classification for highly sensitive information, and this had never before been made public. But the Cabinet Office, senior cybersecurity officials and ministers have since strongly denied that the “most sensitive government information” had been compromised. Ciaran Martin, who was head of the National Cyber Security Centre at the time of the alleged breach, said in a statement that it was “categorically untrue that in 2020 briefings were given to the effect that the Chinese state had compromised the bespoke systems used for circulating Strap and other highly classified state secrets”. He said that both the cabinet secretaries who served in 2020 confirmed to him that they were “unaware of ever receiving any briefing about Chinese state compromise of the classified IT systems” and never gave any such briefing to Johnson and Cummings.",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/oct/16/prosecutions-director-must-explain-why-china-spy-case-was-dropped-says-minister,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d531e71f36df851b9482ec86e79bd6053562df55/350_0_4118_3294/master/4118.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ceeec45b17e0b2fdbb1f0b762ee9d133",2025-10-16T08:42:26+00:00,eaae3d23fb8478d883098cf787a45a7bf4ca1fc7
4e03551b08a5,Gramophone classical music awards honour Simon Rattle for a second time; Raphaël Pichon’s Bach takes top prize,,"The Gramophone classical music awards 2025 were announced last night at a ceremony in central London in which Sir Simon Rattle made history as the first musician ever to win artist of the year for a second time, having first been awarded the title in 1993. The award recognises Rattle’s recent work with the London Symphony Orchestra (where he is conductor emeritus), the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Czech Philharmonic and a string of acclaimed recordings spanning the baroque to contemporary repertoire. In a video acceptance speech, the conductor said: “I was 10 years old when I started spending my pocket money on Gramophone magazine … this is an extraordinary honour.” Video tributes to Rattle from fellow musicians included Barbara Hannigan, Peter Hoare, Thomas Quasthoff, and composer John Adams, who said: “How can someone be one of the great conductors of our time and also just a plain wonderful mensch, a good guy who cares deeply … To have worked with him, to have heard him do my music with the intensity and passion that he’s given it – it’s been one of the great pleasures of my life.” Hannigan said: “You are such an inspiration to me and to so many musicians and audiences with your boundless curiosity, your kindness and the energy you bring to everything you do.” Widely regarded as the classical recording world’s ultimate accolade, the awards – presented with Presto Music – celebrate exceptional recordings and honour artists, ensembles and record labels. The recording of the year was awarded to the French conductor Raphaël Pichon and his choir and period-instrument orchestra Pygmalion for their recording of JS Bach’s Mass in B Minor on the Harmonia Mundi label. Gramophone hailed the performance as one “that gleams at the cellular level, radiating outwards with devotional warmth; in short, it is alive”. María Dueñas, winner of young artist of the year, performs at the Gramophone awards 2025. Photograph: Jamie Hodgskin Rising star María Dueñas , 22, was named young artist of the year. The Spanish violinist, who won first prize at the Menuhin competition in 2021 and records for Deutsche Grammophon, also took the instrumental category for her album of Paganini’s 24 Caprices. Two world premiere recordings won awards. The first – not surprisingly – was in the contemporary category, with the award going to Sir George Benjamin’s live recording of his 2023 opera Picture a Day Like This, with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. The second, remarkably, was for music dating back at least 600 years but that has only seen the light of day this past year. The Krasiński Codex: Fifteenth-Century Music from Cracow was awarded the early music recording of the year prize. The extraordinary recording is of music from a mid-1420s manuscript that narrowly avoided destruction in 1944 when the library of the Polish nobleman Wincenty Krasiński fell victim to Nazi arson. This particular manuscript, the Krasiński Codex, was one of the only documents saved from the fire, possibly by a musicologist working for the Third Reich who recognised its importance and stole it, saving it from oblivion. The codex was returned to Poland in 1948 and the music collected on it and now recorded for the first time – over 40 mostly polyphonic pieces – is a testament to the rich musical landscape of the late middle ages, and provides a unique picture of European musical culture at the time. Baritone Sir Thomas Allen was presented with the lifetime achievement award by Gerald Finley (himself a winner, in the opera category for his recording, with Lise Davidsen, of Wagner’s Flying Dutchman ). The celebrated British singer, who was born in County Durham in 1944, made his Covent Garden debut in 1971 and over the past five decades has performed in opera houses around the world in repertoire ranging from Mozart to Britten and Strauss to Sondheim. He made his final stage appearance last summer, in Glyndebourne’s The Merry Widow . Accepting the award in person, Allen paid tribute to the many legendary singers he had worked with over his long career on stage: “I feel like a tiny, tiny prawn in a sea of greatness.” And he ended his acceptance speech with touching and heartfelt words of thanks to his longtime agent, Sue Spence, and his wife, Jeannie.

2f1e7056ecf6,"Ex-Catholic priest exploited family deaths to abuse disabled boy, police allege",,"A man working as a Roman Catholic priest in New Orleans positioned himself as a mentor to a young disabled boy grieving two family deaths – and then exploited the proximity to abuse him for years, police allege . Those details are contained in criminal court records generated by the arrest of Mark Francis Ford in Indiana in September as well as his subsequent transfer to New Orleans’s jail, a process which was completed late on Tuesday. Ford, 64, made an initial court appearance on Wednesday as he became the latest figure to come under scrutiny during the New Orleans Catholic church’s long standing clergy molestation scandal . A magistrate commissioner temporarily ordered Ford held without bail. Ford is one of several men who have worked as Catholic clergymen in New Orleans to have been arrested by authorities in connection with child sexual abuse allegations both before and after the city’s archdiocese filed for federal bankruptcy protection in 2020. That bankruptcy filing was designed to limit the archdiocese’s financial liability with respect to hundreds of claims of clergy molestation, mostly victimizing children, over several decades. The New Orleans archdiocese has agreed to pay at least $230m to collectively settle with abuse survivors whose claims are tied up in the bankruptcy. Those survivors have until 29 October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. According to a sworn statement from one of the city’s sex crimes detectives, the accuser at the center of Ford’s case reported being about 10 when he met the man known to him as “Father Mark” in 2004. It was through a program for disabled youth named God’s Special Children, which Ford co-founded, the police statement recounted. The boy was mourning the deaths of his grandmother and father when Ford – who was a Catholic priest from 1992 to 2007 – grew close to him, making it a point to visit the child at home to play video games with him and give him guitar lessons, the police statement said. Then, police alleged, Ford began displaying pornography to the boy, who has a degenerative spinal condition which occasionally requires him to use a wheelchair and is on the autism spectrum. Ford was said to have ignored the boy when he expressed discomfort with the explicit content and allegedly instructed the child to keep it secret from his mother. On several occasions after that, Ford allegedly sexually attacked the boy at the child’s home, telling him his family would not believe him if he ever spoke out. An aunt of the boy walked in shortly after one of the attacks, prompting the child to try to signal distress through body language and eye contact – though the relative did not realize anything was wrong, according to police. The accuser, legally ruled to be a minor despite having reached the age of majority, came forward to police in November 2024. He subsequently underwent two forensic interviews, and on 9 September, police obtained a warrant to arrest Ford on four counts of first-degree rape. The warrant also accused Ford of two counts each of sexual battery, indecent behavior with a juvenile and second-degree kidnapping. The offenses Ford is alleged to have committed in the case occurred between 2004 and 2014, the warrant for his arrest said. Mark Francis Ford, who was arrested last month. Photograph: Obtained by the Guardian On 25 September, police arrested Ford in Portage, Indiana, where he was residing, holding him without bail pending his extradition to New Orleans. Ford waived his right to challenge the extradition at a 1 October court hearing. And he was booked into New Orleans’s lockup late on Tuesday. Ford in court on Wednesday was ordered held without bail until at least another hearing that was tentatively set for Friday. He would face mandatory life imprisonment if eventually convicted as accused. Ford belonged to the Catholic religious order known as the Vincentians, and he ministered at various churches within the archdiocese of New Orleans as well as the dioceses of Dallas and Gallup, New Mexico, during his clerical career. He helped launch God’s Special Children while at New Orleans’s St Joseph church, which the Vincentians have run since 1858. The Vincentians say Ford eventually successfully asked the Vatican to laicize him, or remove him from the Catholic priesthood. An online profile of Ford said he worked for Louisiana’s government beginning in 2006 as assistant director of disability affairs, and later, in a separate role, aided efforts by the state’s Native tribes to recover from hurricanes. More recently, Ford was reported to have joined the US hunger relief non-profit Feeding America with positions in Phoenix and Chicago. And he was listed as a board member of the American Indian Center in Chicago. The church watchdog group BishopAccountability.org says Ford was not listed among active clergy members in the 1994, 1999, 2002 and 2003 editions of the Official Catholic Directory (OCD) – disappearances that often correlate with “problems in ministry that are not being managed in a transparent way, and/or periods during which the priest has been sent to a treatment center”. Only the earliest of those interruptions in ministry was ostensibly explained in the news media, as BishopAccountability.org noted. The Dallas Morning News reported in 1997 that Ford had previously entered a program in Albuquerque, New Mexico, run by the Servants of the Paraclete. The reason provided was that Ford had problems managing money while working at two churches in Arizona for the diocese of Gallup. The Servants of the Paraclete’s program at the time was arguably better known for treating other issues – ranging from substance abuse to child sexual abuse. As a gesture of transparency and reconciliation amid the fallout of the worldwide Catholic church’s clergy molestation scandal, the Vincentians, the New Orleans archdiocese and the dioceses of Gallup and Dallas have published lists of clergymen with credible allegations of child molestation.

In the highly unlikely setting of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, Trump proffered an olive branch to an even less likely recipient: the Jewish state’s arch enemy, Iran . “It would be great if we made a peace deal with them. Wouldn’t it be nice?” he said. “I think they want to.” The price for ending nearly half a century of hostilities between Washington and Tehran – dating back to the 1979-81 US embassy takeover that followed the Iranian revolution – would be for the theocratic regime to stop funding militant proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah and “finally recognize Israel’s right to existence”, he said. If this was hardly music to the ears of politicians in Jerusalem – conditioned by decades of enmity and a belief that Iran’s Islamic rulers constituted an existential threat – it received an even colder reception in 1,000 miles away in Tehran. Having rebuffed Trump’s highly unorthodox invitation to attend a gathering in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh hastily arranged to celebrate the end of the war in Gaza and herald a supposed new era of peace in the Middle East, senior regime figures projected an uncompromisingly familiar posture. They were in no mood to forgive the US bombing last June of their nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan and Nantanz, or for the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards Qods forces, in January 2020 during Trump’s first presidency. “While favoring diplomatic engagement, neither President [Masoud] Pezeshkian nor I can engage with counterparts who have attacked the Iranian People and continue to threaten and sanction us,” Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, posted on social media, explaining the refusal of the invite to Sharm el-Sheikh. Accordingly, Trump’s diplomatic gambit is unlikely to go anywhere soon. Indeed, with suspicions in Tehran running even higher than usual after Israel launched its own assault just as Iranian negotiators were preparing for a sixth round of talks over Iran’s nuclear program , a more likely outcome might be a resumption of military hostilities. “One might see optimism here that Trump wants to be diplomatic and he really wants to open a dialogue. But we’ve been down that road before, and it ended in the June war,” said Nader Hashemi, professor of Middle East politics at Georgetown University. “Trump’s Knesset comments aren’t new but we’re in a different moment now. The logical conclusion of the summer’s war and the US bombing from Tehran’s perspective, is you can’t trust the United States. You can’t trust Trump. He’s completely unpredictable. The only safe path forward to secure Iran’s national security is to try and beef up its own military capacity, which means air defenses, missiles, and then figure out how Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon without being attacked again. “A cycle of attack that we saw then, with Israel attacking and then Iran retaliating, then the United States [stepping in] is probably going to reappear again within Trump’s [presidency] – probably a lot sooner than later.” Standing in the path of Trump’s vision of a peace triangle between the US, Israel and Iran is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 86-year-old Iranian supreme leader, and a likeminded hardline faction of decision makers. Since replacing Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran’s Islamic revolution as the country’s top cleric in 1989, Khamenei has made thwarting US foreign policy in the Middle East and denying Israel’s legitimacy his life’s work. Hopes of affecting a sea change in Iranian policy are likely to founder as long as Khamenei is alive and retains power, according to Abbas Milani , director of Iranian studies at Stanford University. “It’s realistic only if it means a different ruling elite in Iran, certainly not with Mr Khamenei at the helm, and his coterie still in charge of great parts of the regime,” he said. “I think the chances of them coming to an agreement are nil.” Milani likened Trump’s invitation to regime figures to attend Sharm El-Sheikh to “inviting the arsonist to celebrate the end of a fire”, pointing out that Iran still maintained its support for Hamas and opposition to a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet the very counterintuitive nature of the invitation might further unsettle a regime already rattled from years of damagingly effective protests against its strict hijab laws that have left its domestic authority weakened. “It has created a discussion and friction within the regime, with some people publicly saying, ‘We should have gone. Why not go and talk to Trump,’” said Milani. “Creating these kinds divisions within a ruling class that used to be almost monolithic – at least in foreign policy – might be one unintended or intended consequence of what is a very strange invitation. “Increasingly, people in Iran are challenging Khamenei, sometimes by name, but sometimes by allusion [through blaming his close regime acolytes],” said Milani. “While I think Trump acts by instinct, if he is trying to add fire to these tensions – and tensions within the ruling elite is clearly the first of the preconditions for transition – maybe he is on to something.” He added: “ It really is a very delicate situation in Iran. It requires the tact of a neurosurgeon .” In the absence of those rarefied skills, the more likely short-term outcome is a re-escalation of tensions amid raised US and Israeli demands and redoubled Iranian pushback, said Sina Toossi, an analyst at the Center for International Policy. “The dominant perception in the Trump administration is that Iran is weakened and that we can get a lot more from them than just a nuclear deal,” he argued. “They want to see if they can force capitulation – meaning recognition of Israel [and] ending Iran’s role in the region. There’s been demands made for Iran to restrict its missile program. If they’re trying to go down that road, they’re going to ratchet it up. “Iran in turn will stick to its guns and double down on its relations with China, Russia, and other neighboring countries, and create a cost for the US. It could get more heated up in the near future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/trump-middle-east-peace-iran-israel,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e6f31a0b179cba8d8764143943e2e81993c1f4/358_0_3578_2863/master/3578.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9e70847718dc1e245e7675a15259b3b",2025-10-16T09:00:03+00:00,936ed83c52ecf30e5a8fa4e844b0d271f49cdb7f
2be318557181,Thousands in UK open case against Johnson & Johnson over alleged talcum powder cancer link,,"Thousands of people are taking legal action against the US pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, claiming it knowingly sold asbestos-contaminated talcum powder in the UK. As many as 3,000 people have alleged that either they or a family member developed forms of ovarian cancer or mesothelioma from using Johnson’s Baby Powder, and are seeking damages at the high court in London. Lawyers for the group said in court documents filed on Thursday by KP Law that Johnson & Johnson, along with current and former subsidiaries Johnson & Johnson Management and Kenvue UK, should all be held liable. They said J&J “concealed” the risk to the public for decades, having replaced talc with corn starch in its baby powder in the UK since 2023. A spokesperson for Kenvue, which was formerly J&J’s consumer health division and now has responsibility for talc-related claims outside the US and Canada, said the talc used in baby powder complied with regulations, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer. Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined from the ground. Michael Rawlinson KC, for the group of people bringing the claim, said in court documents that “there exist very few, if any, commercially exploited talc deposits in the world which do not contain asbestos and that all of the mines supplying the defendants contained asbestos”. He also said that reports from such mines, as well as its own research alongside existing scientific literature, would have informed J&J about asbestos contamination. Despite this, the company “suppressed information that might indicate that baby powder was contaminated with asbestos”, the barrister added. He also said J&J “lobbied regulators” to enable the continued sale of its product and sponsored studies in an effort to “downplay the dangers” to human health. J&J therefore “acted in bad faith, to protect the reputation and profit-making potential of baby powder and the goodwill attached to their name”, Rawlinson said. J&J denies the allegations, including any claims it knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos. Janet Fuschillo, who is one of the people bringing the case, said she used J&J’s baby powder since the 1960s, and that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer seven years ago. The 75-year-old said: “I used talc on myself and all four of my children … I used talc when I changed nappies, after baths, all the time, for close to 50 years. “It’s a source of great concern and anger that I used talc on my children.” Patricia Angell said her husband, Edward, died in 2006 aged 64, a few weeks after being diagnosed with mesothelioma. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “When he fell ill the doctors asked him if he ever came into contact with asbestos and he told them he never had. “He would come home from work and shower every day and use J&J’s talc … Talc was mentioned on Edward’s autopsy report, along with asbestos strains found in contaminated talc.” She added that her husband had been “robbed” of 19 years of life and her children robbed of a father. Mesothelioma, a form of cancer, is almost always caused by asbestos exposure, according to the NHS, and it commonly forms in the lungs after people inhale the microscopic fibres. Rawlinson said the method of application of the baby powder – squeezing or shaking the bottle – meant that “clouds” of powder hung in the air “for a very long time after use” and were inhaled by the person using it. A Kenvue spokesperson said: “We sympathise deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers – that’s why the facts are so important. “The safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder is backed by years of testing by independent and leading laboratories, universities and health authorities in the UK and around the world. “The high-quality cosmetic grade talc that was used in Johnson’s Baby Powder was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/thousands-in-uk-open-case-against-johnson-johnson-over-alleged-talcum-powder-cancer-link,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18b4c09eef0fa9ca75bbd8ca8b16f42810722f58/905_0_4503_3605/master/4503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=81f48b4775b755828d8278934cb26e3b",2025-10-16T07:34:23+00:00,fccb4cd5cc4228e096485112690eda4f3cd309ba
29ea73bca3d3,Experts urge UK to ban cigarette filters to protect health and environment,,"Cigarette filters don’t work and are a major source of plastic pollution that should be banned by the UK government, experts have said. In an editorial in Addiction, the journal for the Society for the Study of Addiction, researchers argue that ministers should use a forthcoming tobacco and vapes bill to “ban filters in the interests of public health and the environment.” “Cigarette filters were designed to give the false impression of safety,” said Dr Katherine East, associate professor in public health at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is lead author on the editorial. “In reality, they do not reduce toxicant exposure and may even increase harm, because they lead people to inhale deeper and for longer and can embed harmful fibres and microplastics in the lungs. “They are also a major contributor to the global plastic waste crisis.” The number of smokers in the UK has been falling since at least 2011, but about 6 million adults in the country still smoke, on average consuming about 11 cigarettes a day. Even as more people choose to roll their own cigarettes to save money, most continue to use filters – technically single-use plastics – usually for health reasons. East and her colleagues cited polling showing that more than three-quarters of people – and more than four-fifths of smokers – erroneously believe that filters protect against the health harms of smoking. In fact, they argued, filters could actually increase the harm from cigarettes, by making them more palatable, by compelling users to inhale more deeply to achieve the same nicotine buzz, and by shedding cellulose acetate fibres and microplastics into users’ lungs. “In combination, these factors mean that the introduction of filters have led to an increase in deadly lung adenocarcinoma,” the researchers write. The tobacco and vapes bill would prevent anyone born from 2009 from legally smoking by gradually raising the age at which tobacco can be bought. But East and her co-authors argue it also “provides a unique opportunity to further regulate tobacco products”. But, they add: “Any ban of cigarettes with filters and filter accessories should be accompanied by public education campaigns to dispel misperceptions about cigarette filters.” skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

762d9eda2364,Women’s Cricket World Cup: Australia v Bangladesh – live,,"Key events Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature 15th over: Bangladesh 58-1 (Sharmin 15, Jhelik 32) Jhelik starts Gardner’s third over with a couple of nice drives, but can’t score from them. On the third ball she goes for the big swing with a slog sweep that’s slightly mistimed, but it falls safely just past the infielders. A good contest between bat and ball in this over. Drinks are on the field. 14th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Sharmin 14, Jhelik 31) Sutherland continues her spell where she left off, with a dot ball. She is hitting a great line and length and making it very difficult for them to score off her. She varies it up with a short ball, but Sharmin is ready for it, getting on top of the bounce and pulling it away for four. Those are the only runs from the over, but any runs scored from a Sutherland over are valuable. 13th over: Bangladesh 52-1 (Sharmin 10, Jhelik 31) Gardner comes back for her second over and the batters immediately look more comfortable, with Sharmin able to work the first ball away for a single. Gardner gets Jhelik edging through the slips again, it falls just wide of Mooney, but it’s good signs from her. Sharmin plays a lovely steer past third for her second boundary, showing great awareness of the field to find those runs. 12th over: Bangladesh 45-1 (Sharmin 4, Jhelik 30) Annabel Sutherland comes into the attack for her first over. She was Australia’s best bowler by far against India the other day, so they will be hoping she brings that form into this match. She has been bamboozling batters with her variations so far this tournament and she keeps Jhelik guessing with a couple of full and straight deliveries, before offering up a short ball. It’s a maiden for her – a good start to her day. 11th over: Bangladesh 45-1 (Sharmin 4, Jhelik 30) We get our first look at spin for the match, with Gardner coming into the bowling attack. Jhelik starts the over with a boundary – Gardner doesn’t quite hit her line, just drifting the ball on to the legside and Jhelik flicks it away past fine leg and over the boundary. There’s almost a mix up when Jhelik takes off for a run in the middle of the over, but she backtracks quickly when Sharmin sends her back. It’s a good over for Bangladesh, let’s see if they can keep building from here. 10th over: Bangladesh 37-1 (Sharmin 4, Jhelik 23) The first ball of the over sees an edge from Jhelik, which flies to Healy for a simple catch, but she puts it down. Brown looks to build the pressure on Jhelik and dots her up for the next few balls, but eventually she finds a gap through point for a single and Sharmin is on strike for the first time. She plays her first ball defensively, looking quite cramped by by Brown’s pace, but next ball she drives it beautifully down the ground for four to get off the mark – a really lovely shot. 9th over: Bangladesh 32-1 (Sharmin 0, Jhelik 22) Schutt to Farzana again and more defensive play to start the over. I think Schutt much prefers bowling to Jhelik who is more likely to attack the bowling and offer up some chances. It seems difficult to even create dot ball pressure on Farzana, as she doesn’t seem to feel any. She’s happy to just play conservatively and wait for opportunities at the moment. Of course, just when I say all that, Farzana edges one to Mooney and she’s gone on the last ball of the over. WICKET! Farzana c Mooney b Schutt 8 (Bangladesh 32-1) It seemed like Jhelik was the player most likely to lose her wicket, but finally Schutt breaks through Farzana’s defence to get her edging to Mooney at first slip. 8th over: Bangladesh 32-0 (Farzana 8, Jhelik 22) A better start to this over from Brown, Farzana continues to be watchful and play defensively. Brown bowls a short ball midway through the over, that’s ruled a wide by the umpire, but she won’t mind that too much, as Farzana looks very uncomfortable as she ducks under it. It’s probably worth giving away the wide to unsettle her. 7th over: Bangladesh 30-0 (Farzana 7, Jhelik 22) Schutt resumes and Farzana again starts the over by rotating the strike and getting Jhelik back into the action. Schutt gets the toe of her bat, it flies to Litchfield at first slip, but bounces off her hand to give Jhelik another life. There’s plenty of frustration in the Australian team at not being able to put these chances to bed. 6th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Farzana 6, Jhelik 22) Farzana immediately gets off strike to start the over and then Brown again catches the edge of Jhelik’s bat, but again it flies in between first and second slip and down to the boundary for four. Australia tightens up its slips cordon, bringing Litchfield in to bolster it. It still looks quite spread out to my (very) amateur eyes, but let’s see if it brings them success. Jhelik decides not to edge it through the slips for her next boundary, instead working it on the front foot through deep midwicket. Share Updated at 05.57 EDT 5th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Farzana 5, Jhelik 12) Farzana gets her first look at the strike in a little while, continuing to offer up that strong front foot defence to Schutt’s bowling. She then plays a nice little flick off her pads down to fine leg that looks like it might go for four, but it’s again saved on the boundary, this time by Brown. It’s still quite cautious batting from Bangladesh here, they are keen to stay at the crease and aren’t being rattled by the dot balls accumulating. Share Updated at 05.55 EDT 4th over: Bangladesh 17-0 (Farzana 4, Jhelik 12) Another over for Brown, she certainly created some chances in her first over. She starts with a dot, but on the next ball, Jhelik goes after it slashing and it flies straight up in the air. Fortunately for Jhelik, it falls safely and she continues on. She plays a lovely cover drive for two midway through the over, which Gardner saves with some good fielding at the deep cover boundary. Share Updated at 05.55 EDT 3rd over: Bangladesh 14-0 (Farzana 4, Jhelik 10) Schutt continues her spell, bowling to Jhelik for the first time. Healy comes up to the stumps to keep this over, trying to unsettle Jhelik and keep her cramped up in her crease. It’s a good start to the over from Schutt, the swing is getting Jhelik playing and there are a few that just miss the edge of her bat. Eventually Schutt catches the edge of the bat, but it trickles in between first and second slip to the boundary for four. Share Updated at 05.55 EDT 2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Farzana 4, Jhelik 5) Brown opens from the other end and she’ll be keen to make up for that misfield with a strong over here. The first ball is quite wide, flirting with the wide line, but not quite pushing wide enough that she has to bowl it again. She adjusts her line and gets Jhelik playing at it – twice in a row it just misses her outside edge. Then she gets that edge she was chasing, but it falls just short of Mooney at first slip and jags up off the ground and bounces over Mooney’s head to run away for four. There’s an appeal for LBW late in the over, but the umpire isn’t interested and Brown isn’t really too keen either, so they decide not to review. Share Updated at 05.55 EDT 1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (Farzana 4, Jhelik 0) Megan Schutt takes the new ball for Australia, as she so often does. Farzana gets off to a great start, with Farzana guiding the ball around the corner and a misfield from Darcie Brown at deep fine leg offers up the first boundary of the match. Schutt fights back with five consecutive dot balls, with Farzana playing a strong front foot defence, staying cautious and watchful in this first over.

While we’re waiting for the toss, why not catch up on last night’s excitement? Unfortunately literal rain rained on the parade of Pakistan, who came within a whisper of their first ever ODI victory over England. If you missed the action, we’ve got you covered with this match report from Raf Nicholson. Hello and welcome to match 17 of the Women’s Cricket World Cup! Today we’ve got the undefeated Australia taking on Bangladesh, who are hunting for their second win of the tournament. It has been a fascinating World Cup so far – while Australia indeed are yet to lose a match, they have looked shaky at times. Their batting against Pakistan was far from its best, while against India they struggled to find the answers during their bowling innings. Both times they were able to get over the line, but opposition teams will be watching closely to note these vulnerabilities and make plans to exploit them. Bangladesh’s sole win of the tournament so far came against Pakistan – a decisive, seven-wicket win with strong contributions across the bowling attack. However, they also put on very good showings against South Africa, which came down to the final over, and England, who looked in trouble at 5/78 chasing Bangladesh’s 178. While neither of those games finished with a win, they will have offered the team plenty of confidence that they have the ability to match it with some of the world’s best teams. If Bangladesh can bring that form into this match, we might be in for another exciting finish. While Australia are very much the favourites here, let’s not write off the underdogs.

2cb5b2d475a7,"Bottom-half budget, top of the table: how Stevenage made English football’s best start",,"T hese are heady days at Stevenage. They are top of League One under Alex Revell and a mile or so up the road an Airbus hub is building robots to explore Mars. A couple of months ago the club’s longstanding chair, Phil Wallace, highlighted how Stevenage were one of the best points-per-pound performers last season – when they finished in mid-table – and after a near-flawless start this time, they have the best points-per-game record across England’s top four divisions. It is fair to say supporters are getting plenty of bang for their buck. A crowd of 7,228 packed into Stevenage’s modest ground for their latest league victory, over Luton, their highest attendance since welcoming Newcastle in the FA Cup fourth round in 1998, when a temporary stand boosted the capacity. Revell exudes pride as he discusses the strides the team have taken since he stepped up to manage the club – where he finished his playing career – for a second time 18 months ago. “We’ve got something everyone else is searching for – and we’ve got to protect that,” the 42-year-old says. The million-dollar question is: how have a team with a bottom-half budget stormed to the summit? Revell takes inspiration from the way Wycombe and Leyton Orient outmuscled bigger fish last season and summer recruitment, overseen by the sporting director, Leon Hunter, was pivotal. Jordan Houghton, a midfielder who began his career at Chelsea, joined after rejecting a new deal at Plymouth, and the goalkeeper Filip Marschall and winger Chem Campbell signed permanently from Aston Villa and Wolves respectively. Dan Kemp and Harvey White also have top-flight pedigree. The top goalscorer, Jamie Reid, is a Northern Ireland international. Things have evolved since Revell retired six years ago. “Before it was: ‘Who can we get?’ Now it’s: ‘Who do we want? Who can make us better?’” Quick Guide Highest points per game in 2025-26 Show Across England’s top four tiers Stevenage : 2.5 (10 games played) Arsenal : 2.29 (seven) Bradford City : 2.18 (11) Swindon Town : 2.18 (11) Walsall : 2.17 (12) Liverpool : 2.14 (seven) Coventry City : 2.11 (nine) Cardiff City : 2.09 (11) Revell returned to Stevenage in January 2022, initially as an academy coach before being named first-team coach by the newly appointed manager Steve Evans six weeks later. The following year they toasted promotion to the third tier, as well as a memorable Cup win at Villa Park . As a No 9 at Rotherham, Revell famously sent Evans haring down the Wembley touchline after scoring a peach in a playoff victory that propelled them into the Championship. Upon joining Evans’s staff, he was unafraid to get his hands dirty, putting the sports science degree he completed as a player – his dissertation focused on the psychosocial factors that affect players during injury – into practice. “Sports science is the Grim Reaper, right?” Revell says. “Warm-ups, running, no one likes them. I dived into it. I did video analysis because we didn’t have any analysts when we got promoted out of League Two.” Is there a job he hasn’t done? “I haven’t been groundsman yet,” he says, smiling, looking towards those at work on the mowers below. Even now, Stevenage have only seven first-team staff. “They don’t really have a job title … you might have to bring waters in from the gym, help us put cones out. That’s what we are, what we enjoy. We’re a really tight-knit group who are pushing for success.” Stevenage are hoping to bring second-tier league football to Broadhall Way for the first time. Photograph: George Tewkesbury/Shutterstock Revell shared a classroom with Wayne Rooney, Jonathan Woodgate, Ashley Cole and Tanya Oxtoby on his Uefa pro licence, during which he visited Google and British Cycling. Revell, whose wife, Julia, is a neonatologist, did a presentation on pressure after studying emergency services, the Red Arrows and bomb disposal experts. “I played against Ashley [for Southend against Chelsea in 2009] and he gave me the worst 90 minutes ever because I was just constantly chasing him, but suddenly me and him were working together on a scenario, looking at each other going: ‘What should we do?’” He acknowledges the power of momentum, citing how Bradford and AFC Wimbledon, second and fifth in the division, have adapted after promotion. He also values his gut. After a 5-0 defeat at Newport in 2021 that left Stevenage 20th in the fourth tier, he confided in Wallace that the team required an experienced leader. “It was the best thing I ever did. If I hadn’t had that time, I probably wouldn’t be here now. I remember sitting with Charlie, my eldest son, in his bedroom before I left and he said: ‘It’s the first time you’ve read to me in a year and a half.’ It wasn’t. But it was the first time I was present, not with my phone next to me looking at a game or replying to messages. It was a poignant moment.” Alex Revell has guided Stevenage to top spot in League One after replacing Steve Evans. Photograph: Simon Dael/Shutterstock Revell took a similar decision as a youngster, dropping out of the professional game at Cambridge United, whom he joined age seven. “John Beck signed me; he saw me running the channel, I hooked it on and he went: ‘Right, I’m going to give you a two-year contract,’” he says, laughter now filling the room. But he fell out of love with the game, so joined Braintree Town and set up a business as a personal trainer. “I follow my gut a lot. When I don’t, it causes uncertainty in me.” He enjoyed playing part-time in the Isthmian League. “Myself, Jermaine Beckford and DJ Campbell were all scoring goals in the same division. Leeds signed Jermaine from Wealdstone, DJ went to Brentford from Hayes & Yeading, and I was kind of waiting … then Brighton came in and paid £8,000 for me.” Wallace, who saved Stevenage from liquidation in 1999, is one of a handful of owners whose stewardship predates the millennium. He has invested in four facilities in close proximity, including an impressive training base and a sports hub for community use. The chair, who made his name in the food business and is the chief executive of Lamex Foods, has overseen the club’s rise from non-league to this point. They qualified for the League One playoffs in 2012 but two seasons later finished bottom and spent the subsequent nine seasons in League Two. In 2020, during the pandemic, they dodged relegation to non-league after Macclesfield were handed a points deduction. This campaign Stevenage, Liverpool and Bradford are the only teams in the top four tiers with a 100% home league record. On Saturday they travel to Lincoln, another team punching above their weight , seeking to maintain the feelgood factor. Not so long ago the mere thought of reaching the second tier for the first time was probably akin to finding life on Mars. Revell recognises and relishes Stevenage’s position as underdogs but is acutely aware how their fast start – Lewis Hamilton is surely the Hertfordshire town’s most famous son – may be perceived externally. “‘It’s 10 games: is it just a purple patch?’” says Revell, whose side also have at least one game in hand on almost all their rivals. “That is what people will be saying. Being where we are, we’ve always got something to prove. It is a great place to be because it keeps us on our toes: ‘Let’s prove people wrong.’ It is a really exciting time for us as a club.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/16/stevenage-top-league-one-english-football-best-start,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fb875a89b4697f9b8a0124b10314bfe726e07cb/241_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a2d211cb4d91c76caf9895ad28882f0",2025-10-16T10:00:04+00:00,82d9865f326f35836b5f8f4292aa565bcebd6c03
51bc6c0c4bc3,‘I can’t keep living like this’: Ali Riley on ending her stellar soccer career,,"U nder a blazing-hot sun, among a crowd of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on 10 July 1999, an 11-year-old girl was standing behind the goal where Brandi Chastain struck the penalty that won the World Cup for the United States , soaking in pure inspiration. Ali Riley, now 37, captain of New Zealand and a veteran of five World Cup campaigns, looks back on witnessing that moment in person and says: “That made me want to be a strong woman that could show her abs in front of the entire world and be on the front page of a newspaper. I think about how uncool it was to be good at sports, back then, and that moment was pivotal for me to see those women do what they did and be celebrated for it.” On Sunday it will be Riley being celebrated at what is being billed as her farewell match at her home-town club Angel City, who named her as their first captain in 2022. She is retiring at the end of this season after a remarkable career that has included 163 international caps, four Olympic Games and spells with Rosengård, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, and Sunday is poised to be Angel City’s final home game of a season in which the playoffs appear to be beyond them. Her decision to retire comes after a year in which she has been through IVF, seen her childhood Los Angeles home burn down and got married, all while attempting to rehabilitate from a chronic nerve injury, so being able to hang up her boots on her own terms, back in Angel City’s squad, may be her biggest achievement. Brandi Chastain’s celebration after winning the 1999 World Cup inspired Ali Riley. Photograph: Robert Beck/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images “I went into a 50-50, landed awkwardly, and I just felt burning down my whole left leg,” Riley says, of the initial injury to a muscle in her glutes, the obturator internus, in 2023, the complications from which led to her nerve injury. “I had never felt anything like that before, and for months I couldn’t walk. You get like these lightning strikes burning your leg. I called them ‘zingers’. “I had medical professionals saying to me: ‘It’s in your head, so if you meditate, you won’t feel it.’ That’s not correct, that did not help me. We were trying medication, injections, but the pain, it takes your breath away, like someone stabbing you. I went in the gym every day for seven months and saw no progress. And then we found a doctor in Salt Lake city who – I thank him – tried a different injection and eventually I got to where I am right now. I can use my leg to play soccer. For two hours I can be on the field and feel great. The rest of the day is still pretty tough. I can perform, I can train and I get to be with my team. But physically and emotionally, I can’t do this for longer than probably another couple of games, so I can’t keep living like this. I am retiring because I have to take care of myself.” Riley returned to Angel City’s matchday squad in August, crying tears of joy with her teammates and medical staff, but has not got beyond being an unused substitute, though the hope is for her make an appearance on Sunday. She wants more knowledge for people needing treatment for nerve injuries and more discussion in soccer around motherhood and supporting aspiring parents. “I did two rounds of IVF during my injury – it’s something we should be speaking about more,” she says. “There is a very short window and an egg retrieval can be very uncomfortable [so] I really hope that we get even more support. “It’s not something that anyone spoke to me about and doing IVF at age 37, it’s a lot harder than if you freeze your eggs earlier in your career. We’re seeing more players have kids and return to play, which is so important for that visibility. Right now it’s not possible for everyone. But women can do anything if we are given the support and the resources.” Ali Riley (left) playing for New Zealand against the US, where she was born, in 2023. Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images Just after her IVF, Riley’s heart broke when her parents’ house, where she had grown up in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, burned down in January’s destructive fires. Riley appears to feel immense sadness as she recalls seeing her neighbourhood burn, but has also a strong sense of perspective, grateful to have her loved ones safe and around her, as well as her memories. “I’m so lucky to have grown up in a place like the Palisades where I was so safe and I was able to be a kid and play outside until dark – it’s where I learned how to play soccer.” She says her parents are planning to rebuild. “I really try to turn everything into a positive,” she says, “and not think so much about my own or our own suffering but wanting to give back and still spread joy.” Three days later she was getting married, and she begins to well up and she speaks of her gratitude for her husband’s contribution to her comeback from injury. “I don’t know what I would do without Lucas because there were many, many days when I was depressed and he has really picked up everything that I used to have more energy for, and brought me so much joy. He’s really been the one to help me get out of the house, do the grocery shopping and make us dinner. I had lost myself a lot and I became definitely a shell of myself and I don’t ever want that to happen again.” Those low points will not be what she remembers most, though, when she reflects on her career of nearly two decades. Her international career with New Zealand , where her father is from, gives her the greatest pride, all the tiring economy-class journeys worth it when she helped her country earn their first World Cup victory . It came on home soil on the opening night of the 2023 World Cup, against Norway, and Riley says it was the “best day and night of my whole life” as her teammates honoured their predecessors. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember just sitting on the field while everyone else swarmed around the ball. My mom didn’t even come to my games because she was like: ‘What am I watching?’ And my dad just really believed in me even back then.” Ali Riley soaks in the moment after New Zealand beat Norway at the 2023 World Cup. Photograph: Andrew Cornaga/AP Riley originally wanted to be a goalkeeper but established herself as a top defender after a strong college career with Stanford University. Her heart has continued to lie in California. “Being part of Angel City has been the best part of my career. To come home, I think it’s what so many athletes dream of. [My mantra was:] ‘I’m going to give everything I have, every day.’” Riley has plenty of media experience – not to mention, a cookbook – and indicates that will be part of her next chapter, although also she says: “I would love to have a Foundation one day. I would love to invest in, or own, a club one day. I want to be part of this insane growth of women’s sports, especially women’s football. “It feels like culture is changing, society is changing. We’re in a different era where we can say: ‘We’ve arrived.’ Yes, we need to fight for more investment. Yes, there are still trolls and a lot of men who might not see the power and how profitable women’s sports is.

de557f422520,Liverpool’s struggles show that Trent Alexander-Arnold is not easily replaced,,"I t’s not a crisis, not yet, but Liverpool’s run of three defeats in a row is reason to take stock. It’s true that the two league games in that run were both lost via last-minute winners, and that in isolation these three games could be explained away relatively easily. But context matters, and the truth is that while Liverpool won their first five league games of the season, they did not play well in them. New players are struggling to settle and Arne Slot’s rejig of the formation has not really worked, while a number of regulars look out of sorts. Last season Liverpool won the league playing extremely controlled soccer, making 2-0 almost a trademark scoreline, establishing their lead and then running the clock down. This season there has been none of that, no sense of playing within themselves. They’ve been extremely open through midfield and most of their wins have come through late goals. There’s been an unexpected wildness to them, almost as though Slot is going through his transition a season late. Introducing any new player to a side is fraught with potential issues. The player has to learn their environment and their teammates have to get used to them. Even in the best cases, dropping a new player into a functioning side will lead to a slight short-term drop-off. Liverpool avoided that last summer by signing only Federico Chiesa. Adding five new players, as they did this offseason, means a lot of disruption. And, of course, this is a squad dealing with the tragic loss of Diogo Jota . Mohamed Salah’s on-pitch tears after the final whistle of the opening game of the season were a reminder that this is a club in mourning. Soccer keeps going, as it must, but the impact of Jota’s death is unpredictable and may be felt for a long time yet. At first it seemed the biggest tactical problem was the switch from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 to accommodate Florian Wirtz as a central creator. The balance given by a central trio of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai was gone, not helped by the fact that Mac Allister still doesn’t quite seem back to his best after a muscle injury, while Wirtz is yet to settle. But in recent games, Slot has returned to last season’s trio, switching back to 4-3-3, and many of the same problems have remained. Liverpool’s centre-backs keep being isolated, a situation exacerbated by Ibrahima Konaté’s loss of form. So what has changed? Why isn’t the centre-back pairing and midfield three that were so effective last season suddenly functioning? The answer is twofold. First, Liverpool’s press has stopped working as it once did. The 2020-21 season, in which Liverpool finished a distant third to Manchester City, offers a warning of what happens when that misfires. Second, and more intriguingly, new full-backs Miloš Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are very different from Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a youth player he had been a midfielder and his gifts were those of somebody who would usually play in midfield. He is arguably the best passer of a ball currently playing for England, which is what led many to argue that he was wasted at full-back, and that he should be used in midfield. Attempts to play him there, though, were unconvincing, as though his years on the right of a back four had somehow rendered him unsuitable for a more central role. And yet he wasn’t a particularly good defender, at least if that is defined in the traditional way. He wasn’t great at marking, and he was, by the standards of top-level full-backs, relatively easy to dribble past. He is sui generis , which is one of the reasons he has never really looked convincing while playing for England. International soccer, given the lack of time available to coaches, prefers plug-in-and-play footballers, right-backs who play like right-backs. But Alexander-Arnold has two attributes that Liverpool are severely missing at the moment. His rapid and accurate 30- and 40-yard passes were often what released Salah, but his passing generally was central to Liverpool’s buildup play. Probably even more important, though, was his capacity to invert into midfield, to become an additional holding player alongside Gravenberch. Frimpong, who was a wing-back at Bayer Leverkusen, is a very different sort of full-back. He runs with the ball rather than passing it, and his natural inclination is to go on the outside not the inside. Given Salah wants to cut inside, that may work eventually. But for now, Liverpool are missing both the balance Alexander-Arnold brought and his capacity to unleash Salah, who has had a very quiet start to the season and is yet to forge a relationship with any of the new forwards. Any side making as many changes as Liverpool will inevitably have teething problems, but what is notable at the moment is that the issue is less the players who are there than one who has left. Alexander-Arnold’s unique range of abilities will not easily be replaced.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/06/liverpools-struggles-show-that-trent-alexander-arnold-is-not-easily-replaced,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94fda8fa6a430514a2acdb85347c5593ce6b5b7d/8_6_4992_3994/master/4992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=628a1fcf2efff6c2de44a678da2020d8",2025-10-06T15:05:16+00:00,b6f96dd50681e68ffc1047c90839096e36703433
e3451de7d7e8,Rachel Reeves says those with broadest shoulders should pay fair share of tax,,"Rachel Reeves has said those with the “broadest shoulders” should pay their “fair share” into the exchequer as she prepares to raise taxes in next month’s budget. The chancellor is expected to deliver a package of tax increases and spending cuts on 26 November to meet her fiscal rules in the face of deteriorating forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Speaking in Washington DC, where she was attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Reeves confirmed she was looking at wealthy taxpayers as she draws up her budget plans. But she stressed that she was determined not to deter this group from making the UK their home. “I want Britain to be a great place for talent, for entrepreneurs, for successful individuals to come, and that requires getting the balance right,” Reeves said. “But I do think those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share of tax and I think you can see that from my actions last year at the budget.” She added: “I want the UK to remain an attractive place, but we’ve got to get the balance right and I do think that if Britain is your home you should pay your taxes here.” Pressed for details about how she could raise the additional revenue needed, the chancellor said: “We’re not going to be introducing a wealth tax. We already have a number of taxes in the UK that do tax wealth and do tax wealthy people, and some of those we increased in the budget last year.” Asked to clarify who may be affected, she added: “Wealth’s not about your annual salary.” Reeves stressed changes to the government’s visa regime as evidence Labour remained keen to welcome talented individuals. “This week we’ve doubled the visas available for global talent. We want Britain to be a place where people come and build their teams and build their businesses,” she said. The chancellor told the Guardian in an interview on Wednesday that higher taxes on the wealthy would “be part of the story” of her autumn budget. Reeves also said on Thursday that the government would take more action in the budget on rising prices after the IMF’s warning that UK consumers are expected to suffer the highest inflation rate in the G7 this year and next. “Inflation is still too high. Some of that is due to food prices, energy prices. We’ve seen yesterday the [markets watchdog] review on vet prices . We do want to bear down on some of the costs that people face,” she said, adding that she was preparing to announce “a range of policies to do that”. Reeves confirmed reports that she would like to use the budget to build up more headroom against her fiscal rules – but stressed that this would be difficult, because it required higher taxes or deeper spending cuts. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves appeared to play down the likelihood of taxing banks more heavily in the budget. Asked about the issue, she said: “We want to make sure that Britain is a great place to do business and to bring in business. Just in the last week or two, JP Morgan have made a £3m investment in Bournemouth for example. “Financial services is one of our big success stories in the UK and we want to make sure that we have a competitive environment. But also we want to make sure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. We’ve got to get the balance right there.” Reeves also confirmed that she was considering downgrading the status of the OBR’s spring forecast, so that she would only be measured against her fiscal rules once a year, in the autumn budget.

f2a8068b685b,"Cost of taking over British Steel rises to £235m, government says",,"The cost of taking control of British Steel has risen to £235m, the UK government has said, as it acknowledged concern over the threat of EU tariffs that could significantly harm the business. The government passed emergency legislation in April to take control of British Steel amid fears that its Chinese owner, Jingye Steel, was planning to walk away from its Scunthorpe steelworks. The takeover preserved the jobs of 3,500 workers at British Steel but it has left the government footing the bill for the loss-making company. The industry minister, Chris McDonald, said the government had paid for “working capital, covering items such as raw materials, salaries, and addressing unpaid bills, including for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the supply chain”, in a written statement to parliament published this week. The latest costs add to the £604m spent on keeping the Scunthorpe plant going in 2019 and 2020, when it collapsed into insolvency under its previous owner, the private equity fund Greybull Capital. Jingye bought it in early 2020. The government’s strategy has been to try to increase British Steel’s output in order to raise profitability, after Jingye claimed the Scunthorpe operation was losing £700,000 a day because of a global glut. The government’s official receiver is also temporarily in control of Liberty Steel after it collapsed into administration. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a national officer at GMB, a union representing workers, said: “This investment in our steel communities is exactly what taxpayers’ money should be used for. Under the previous government, £500m was given to Tata to make more than 2,000 people redundant. The people of Port Talbot will not forget. “In contrast, British Steel has taken on more than 50 apprentices this year, supported a further 180 people into employment and has continued to produce world-beating steel. This is clearly money well spent.” However, the problems facing British Steel and the rest of the UK steel industry could be compounded if the EU carries out a threat to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50%. UK Steel, a lobby group, said it was an “existential threat” to the sector , because 78% of all steel exports from Britain went to the EU. McDonald, himself a former steel executive, said the EU tariff threat “will be highly concerning for many of our steel producers and their workers”. Government ministers and officials have held talks with their EU counterparts in the hope of agreeing a quota for UK exports that would allow products to keep flowing. The EU tariffs were largely aimed at protecting its own producers from the global glut of steel that originated in China . Over the last three decades China has transformed from a minor player to the world’s largest producer, responsible for more than half of global output in 2024. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

4007d2325d01,Starmer orders NHS antisemitism review after ‘clear cases not dealt with adequately’,,"Keir Starmer has ordered a review of antisemitism in the NHS, saying “clear cases” are not being dealt with adequately. The prime minister said John Mann, the government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, would lead the review as part of a wider crackdown on antisemitism in the UK. During a visit to the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors antisemitism and provides protection for Jewish communities in the UK, the prime minister also announced £10m would be provided for security for Jewish amenities, including synagogues and schools. He said: “We have heard loud and clear in the last few days and weeks that words are not enough, action is what matters.” Announcing Lord Mann’s review at the CST, Starmer added: “Lord Mann is going to do a review of the NHS for us. There are just too many examples, clear examples, of antisemitism that have not been dealt with adequately or effectively. “So we need to do that review. We’ve already put in place management training in relation to the NHS, but I think we need a wider review, because in some cases, clear cases are simply not being dealt with, and so we need to get to the root of that.” Starmer also said universities had been “too slow” in dealing with cases of antisemitism, singling out the University of Oxford, which is understood to have suspended a student on Wednesday after he was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred. The student is alleged to have chanted for Gaza to “put the Zios in the ground” during a protest in London on Saturday. Starmer said: “Look at Oxford this week. That was a slow reaction to the clearest of cases.” Starmer’s visit followed the terrorist attack at the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester on 2 October that left two men dead. Statistics released by the Home Office last week suggest antisemitic hate crime remains near record levels. The prime minister said: “The figures are all going in the wrong direction. And it’s not just the figures, it’s the feeling of insecurity and the fear that it instils in our community.” In a separate review published in July, Mann and the former Conservative minister Penny Mordaunt warned of rising antisemitism across British society, including a “specific unaddressed issue” within the NHS. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood , who accompanied Starmer to the CST on Thursday, said she was reviewing protest legislation and providing additional police protection outside synagogues and other locations. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, also spoke at the CST event.

86c3570e295f,MI5 chief ‘frustrated’ at failure to put men accused of spying for China on trial,,"The MI5 director general, Ken McCallum, has acknowledged his frustration at the failure to put on trial two Britons who had been accused of spying for China , in an apparent rebuke to prosecutors who dropped the high-profile case last month. The domestic spy chief insisted he would “never back off” from confronting threats from Beijing, which he said posed a national security threat “every day”, although the wider UK-China relationship was a matter for the government. A China-related spy plot was disrupted “in the last week”, he said, though it is understood not to have involved parliament, while the number of individuals under investigation over all state-based threats is up 35% in the last year. Giving a long-planned annual update, the MI5 chief was asked to comment on a surprise decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to abandon the prosecution of Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry last month . “Of course I am frustrated when opportunities to prosecute national security threatening activity are not followed through for what ever reason,” the spy chief said, though he added that MI5 had been successful in halting the activities the two men had been accused of. “Clearly when we believe there has been activity threatening UK, national security convictions are great. We work very hard with our police colleagues to make those possible. And so, it’s frustrating when they don’t happen. “But I would invite everyone to just not miss the fact this was a strong disruption in the interests in UK national security,” McCallum said in a question-and-answer session with journalists that came after he gave a speech. Cash, who worked for Conservative MPs Tom Tugendhat and Alicia Kearns, and Berry, a teacher and researcher based in China at the time, were accused of spying for Beijing by passing on information from parliament to a Chinese agent known as “Alex” and Cai Qi, a member of the country’s ruling politburo. The two men denied the charges, and have always asserted their innocence. However, questions have swirled as to why the CPS thought it had enough evidence to charge the men in April 2024, under a Conservative government, but felt they had to drop the case under Labour after a change to the case law. The case collapsed in the end, the CPS said, because Matthew Collins, a deputy national security adviser, had failed to give evidence on behalf of the government that clearly described China as a current “threat to national security” as required by the 1911 Official Secrets Act under which they were charged. Asked specifically about whether he thought China did pose the threat level required by the prosecution, McCallum said: “Do Chinese state actors present a UK national security threat? And the answer is, of course, yes they do every day.” But he said that “the overall balance of UK bilateral foreign policy relationships” was “perfectly legitimately a matter for government” – and added that he was “not going to presume to appoint myself a temporary expert in the running of prosecutions”. At one point, in his initial speech, the spy chief personalised the agency’s response to the spy row, saying: “I am MI5 born and bred. I will never back off from confronting threats to the UK, wherever they come from.” Overnight, Downing St published the three witness statements submitted to prosecutors by Collins, whose job it was to represent the government policy in court. They showed that the CPS dropped the case despite being told by Collins that China’s intelligence agencies “harm the interests and security of the UK”. McCallum described Collins as “a man of high integrity and a professional of considerable quality” and a person who he had known professionally for some years. Ministers have previously said that the task of writing the witness statements was for Collins without reference to politicians and that the prime minister, Keir Starmer, only saw their contents for the first time on Wednesday morning. The MI5 chief also said his agency was contending with “a more hostile world” that is “forcing the biggest shifts in MI5’s mission since 9/11”. A total of 19 late-stage terror attack plots, running at a rate of about four a year, had been disrupted since the start of 2020 and he warned that al-Qaida and Islamic State were seeking to revive. He offered his “deepest sympathies” to the victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, conducted by an individual who had pledged allegiance to IS in a 999 call, describing the terrorist incident as “horrific violence against a community at prayer”. But despite the signs of established terror groups “becoming more ambitious” the main terror threat in the UK came from “individuals or small groups” often from problematic or troubled individuals who were radicalised online. “Terrorism breeds in squalid corners of the internet where poisonous ideologies, of whatever sort, meet volatile often chaotic lives,” he said. The vast majority of other state based threats came from Iran and Russia. MI5 has tracked “more than 20 potentially lethal Iran backed plots” in the past year, McCallum said. Investigators had also disrupted “a steady stream of surveillance plots with hostile intent” from Russia, which often seeks to recruit untrained proxies online. MI5 also continued to see “a concerning number of minors” in its national security investigations, the spy chief said, with one in five of the 232 terrorism arrests last year were of children under 17. The agency said it had helped create an Interventions Centre of Expertise, to try and manage threats in cases involving adolescents, staffed with both national security experts and professionals from the wider public sector.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/mi5-chief-frustrated-at-failure-to-put-men-accused-of-spying-for-china-on-trial,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/582667cabe0564491f7538887e6939f540ecf750/713_152_3746_2997/master/3746.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3fbdf0c6c4650c833437ddb4fc3b3d57",2025-10-16T12:01:22+00:00,4c0152ade33faacae8482ca3a56010ddfd4a1ded
86fe0a68a69d,"Labour ministers met fossil fuel lobbyists 500 times in first year of power, analysis shows",,"Government ministers met representatives from the fossil fuel industry more than 500 times during their first year in power – equivalent to twice every working day, according to research. The analysis found that fossil fuel lobbyists were present at 48% more ministerial meetings during Labour’s first year in power than under the Conservatives in 2023. The government defended the meetings, saying ministers held meetings with a wide range of representatives from “the energy industry, unions and civil society to drive forward our clean energy superpower mission”. The findings have raised concern among critics about the extent of the fossil fuel industry’s influence over government at a time when ministers are trying to lower bills and transition to a more sustainable energy system. A report from the International Energy Agency in 2023 found that fossil fuel companies still had “minimal” engagement with the global clean energy transition, contributing just 1% of clean energy investment globally. Carys Boughton, of Fossil Free Parliament , which carried out the research, said fossil fuel corporations were being given a “backstage pass to government”. “These lobbyists should have no place in ministerial meetings about the energy transition, taxing profits or cutting our bills – it’s in their interest to sabotage these talks.” The analysis, which is based on the government’s published record of ministerial meetings, found: Ministers at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) met fossil fuel lobbyists 274 times, with industry figures present at almost a quarter of meetings. During the same period DESNZ ministers met trade union representatives 61 times. Ed Miliband, the secretary for energy and climate change, met fossil fuel lobbyists 250 times – with a third of all his meetings attended by industry figures. Three fossil fuel companies: BP, Shell and Equinor, met ministers 100 times between them. Fossil fuel lobbyists attended almost every government meeting about the energy profits levy, a temporary windfall tax on the “extraordinary profits” of North Sea oil and gas companies. Carla Denyer, the Green party MP for Bristol Central, said: “Instead of listening to scientists, communities affected by flooding, or parents desperate to secure a safe future for their children and grandchildren, this government is prioritising lobbyists and profits for oil and gas giants. These revelations must mark a turn away from the grubby politics of fossil fuel lobbying.” skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

We need to replace our dependency on unstable fossil fuel markets with clean, homegrown power controlled in Britain, to protect bill payers, drive growth and boost our energy security.” Several major fossil fuel corporations have been criticised for cutting their green investments in recent years amid a global pushback against climate action galvanised by the election of US president Donald Trump. Katrina McDonnell, a campaigns manager at the Good Law Project, said: “Keir Starmer promised a government of service, but that doesn’t mean bowing the knee to corporations making money out of climate catastrophe.

6a650bf91a16,My teachers had no idea I was homeless. People like me hide in plain sight in the UK,,"S omething that often takes me by surprise is how people react to finding out I was homeless growing up. They have a picture of what homelessness should look like, and my family and I don’t fit into it – I’m at university studying medicine now. But people like me hide in plain sight. They’re your neighbours until suddenly they’re not. They’re everywhere and nowhere, all at the same time. My family came to the UK after becoming refugees during the Iraq war, and were homeless, repeatedly, for years – moving from friends’ house to friends’ house, or B&B to B&B. Each new place meant a new school, a new set of friends and a new set of rules I had to get used to. Over time, I think my siblings and I became pretty immune to the anxiety you feel when starting again. I don’t remember all the places we stayed, though most of them were cold. In one, we lived above a party animal, blaring music so loud it would make my head thump as we tried to go to sleep. Others had rats – once my sister burst out of the bathroom screaming, in the middle of the night, because one had emerged when she lifted the toilet seat. In another place there were four of us in one room with all our belongings, while my siblings and I played human Tetris in bunkbeds. I remember reading to my younger brother there, doing my best to give him that normal family experience despite the chaos. Government figures published today show that there are now more than 132,000 households living in all forms of temporary accommodation in England, including more than 172,000 dependent children. It’s a record high – up 8.2% on 2024 – surpassing the last record set earlier this year. The conditions in temporary accommodation are often well below the standard anyone should be expected to accept – it can be cramped, or cold or dangerous. Official data recently found that temporary accommodation in England may have contributed to the deaths of 74 children in just five years . It wasn’t until I was much older, during the Covid pandemic – my GCSE year – that I realised what I’d experienced as a child hadn’t been normal. Usually when we moved schools, we just left, without telling them. But the pandemic meant my mum and dad lost their income from their jobs and things started to get even harder, so I’d had to apply for a bursary. That meant telling my school I was homeless. When I showed a teacher proof of our household income, her face just dropped. She couldn’t believe the number on the paper. She had to ask me again if I was sure of the amount, because she was struggling to believe that that figure had sustained my whole family. When I saw the look on her face, I realised this was not a normal way to live. Leaving all your friends behind and starting afresh year after year just wasn’t normal. No one spoke about it growing up, and I didn’t even understand what was going on. When we were put in a B&B, I had thought we were on holiday. Looking back, I realised it wasn’t a holiday, and it wasn’t through choice, but my parents were pretty good at acting as if it was. My family are now stably housed – we’re safe and happy. After my teacher found out about our situation, she put us on free school meals, which helped massively. I could actually think straight in lessons, I could stay after school for longer because I wasn’t hungry, and teachers stopped pestering me for not having textbooks. Now I’m studying medicine. But today’s figures are a reminder that I’m one of the lucky ones. Thousands are trapped in the same situation I experienced. The instability, the risk, the rats – and the cold. The worst thing is that we could stop this if we wanted to. We know what causes homelessness, which means we know how to end it. That means building more social homes, and it means creating a welfare system that allows people to live in dignity. That would have made all the difference for us – having an affordable, social home would have meant we could have stayed in one place, and had some stability. There are now more than 1.3m households in England alone on waiting lists for a social home, and meanwhile the Guardian has just revealed that Labour plans to slash already-low affordable housing targets for developers. When the Labour government came to power, it promised a strategy to end homelessness. Fifteen months later, we are yet to see it. The same goes for the child poverty strategy. While we wait, more people are going through what my siblings and I did. I’m working with Crisis, the homelessness charity, to call on ministers to urgently deliver a strategy to end homelessness for everyone. Any meaningful plan for change must surely lead to the creation of a society where we can all thrive, because we all have access to a decent, affordable home. We moved from place to place, but none of them were home, because we didn’t feel comfortable living there. I hadn’t realised at the time, but you miss out on a lot, growing up in those circumstances. The milestones I imagine people my age would have cherished didn’t really exist. Looking back, it kind of felt as if everyone else was making small leaps on little stones to cross a river, while my family and I had to wade through, our shoes drenched. It wasn’t normal to grow up like that, and no one else should have to.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/16/homeless-children-government-strategy-child-poverty,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/778a882545235121df5063c1f05f30700c734ad9/210_0_4080_3264/master/4080.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aeabf0582a51a0ec4d6be13a973d56f8",2025-10-16T12:46:35+00:00,30ef4e869800bd43b701bb337142da0e85e0245b
8371e0abe60f,"US airstrike near Venezuela may have killed two Trinidad citizens, police say",,"Police in Trinidad and Tobago are investigating whether two citizens were among six people killed in a US strike on a boat allegedly transporting drugs from Venezuela. Without providing evidence, Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the strike killed six “narcoterrorists” in international waters, allegedly transporting drugs from Venezuela to the United States. Trinidadian police said residents of the village of Las Cuevas reported that the two citizens were on the sunken vessel, but could not confirm their deaths. At least 27 people have been killed so far in such attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration says are necessary to protect the United States from smuggled narcotics from Venezuela. Lenore Burnley, mother of 26-year-old Trinidadian fisherman Chad Joseph, told AFP by phone that people her family know in Venezuela “told them he was on the boat”. “According to maritime law, if you see a boat, you are supposed to stop the boat and intercept it, not just blow it up. That’s our Trinidadian maritime law and I think every fisherman and every human knows that,” she said. Burnley said her son was planning to return to Trinidad and Tobago after spending three months with family in Venezuela, just 6.8 miles (11km) away.

2f9d20866bf9,Italian news publishers demand investigation into Google’s AI Overviews,,"Italian news publishers are calling for an investigation into Google’s AI Overviews, arguing that the search engine’s AI-generated summaries feature is a “traffic killer” that threatens their survival. FIEG, the Italian federation of newspaper publishers, said it has submitted a formal complaint to Agcom, Italy’s communications watchdog. Similar complaints have been filed in other EU countries. Coordinated by the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association, the aim is to push the European Commission to open an investigation against Google under the EU Digital Services Act. The threat posed by AI Overviews , which gives users information without them having to click through to the original source by summarising searches with a block of text at the top of the results page, is among the main concerns of European news outlets. FIEG said it was also worried about the more recent AI Mode, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot. The federation argues that the Google services “violate fundamental provisions of the digital services act, with detrimental effects on Italian users, consumers and businesses”. “Google is becoming a traffic killer,” FIEG said in a statement, adding that the products not only directly compete with content produced by publishing firms, but also “reduces their visibility and discoverability, and thus their advertising revenues”. “This has serious consequences for the economic sustainability and diversity of the media, with all the risks associated with a lack of transparency and the proliferation of disinformation in democratic debate,” the statement said. A study published in July by the UK-based Authoritas analytics company claimed AI Overviews, launched by Google last year, caused up to 80% fewer clickthroughs . The research, which was submitted as part of a legal complaint to the UK’s competition watchdog about the impact of Google AI Overviews, also found that links to YouTube – owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet – were more prominent compared with the normal search result system. A second study by the Pew Research Center, a US thinktank, also showed a big hit to referral traffic from Google AI Overviews, with users only clicking a link under an AI summary once every 100 times. Google claimed the studies were inaccurate and based on flawed methodology. Google AI Overviews arrived in Italy in March. In September, the country became the first in the EU to approve a comprehensive law regulating the use of artificial intelligence, including limiting child access and imposing prison terms on those who use the technology to cause harm, such as generating deepfakes. Giorgia Meloni’s government described the legislation, which aligns with the EU’s landmark AI Act , as a decisive move in influencing how AI is used across Italy.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/16/google-ai-overviews-italian-news-publishers-demand-investigation,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4facf3c2d97e936db3c14109c41fa75377ace05e/339_0_2433_1946/master/2433.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a495b4b746e505849ba65fdf62761b69",2025-10-16T12:53:59+00:00,41431368f395f9f0a583fe38776209cedd6624a1
281bc7b0109e,UK border chief ‘frustrated’ at French failure to curb small boat crossings,,"The UK’s border chief has expressed frustration that the French authorities have not been able to roll out tactics to puncture and disable boats carrying asylum seekers in shallow waters. Martin Hewitt, the border security commander at the Home Office, told MPs that rapid changes in government in France had been a “political backdrop” to introducing a tactic seen as crucial to countering “taxi boats” being used to smuggle people to the UK. Appearing before the Commons’ home affairs select committee, Hewitt said it was “frustrating” that the French authorities had not been able to roll out more interventionist tactics against boats, which pick up people in shallow waters off French beaches. In June, the French cabinet pledged to change the way maritime law was interpreted in order to allow police officers to intercept migrant boats at sea for the first time – within 300 metres of the coast. This was hailed by government insiders as a “gamechanger” for their efforts to stop the crossings, which have reached more than 32,000 so far this year. French police have since said they would not act on the orders without assurances they will be protected, properly trained and well equipped. Asked why the tactic was not yet being used, and if political instability in France was a factor, Hewitt said he was working closely with the French secretary-general to the sea, a senior French official, but continued to find the process “frustrating”. “I was over, and met with him in Paris three weeks ago to really press the point about how significant delivering this maritime tactic is for us because of the taxi boat scenario. “This was referred to by President Macron at the summit in July when he spoke with the [British] prime minister. So it is frustrating that it’s taken the time that it has. Your point about the political instability, clearly that has been a backdrop,” he said. Deaths in the Channel reached “horrific” numbers last winter, as desperate people attempting to reach the UK stormed small boats without paying, Hewitt said. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reported that 2024 had become the deadliest year on record for deaths in the Channel, with at least 82 fatalities including 14 children. Another 20 people are believed to have died this year, as well as eight others travelling to cross. Hewitt said there had been a change in the origins of asylum seekers, with many last autumn and winter coming from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. “I think that’s had a number of impacts, one of the first impacts, and this was particularly prevalent towards the tail [of the summer] and in autumn into winter last year, where we had the horrific period where the number of fatalities rose quite significantly. “For a period, the smugglers lost a bit of control of the process they were running and what was happening was, particularly with the Eritrean [and] Ethiopian migrants, they were storming boats and getting on to boats even when they hadn’t paid,” he said. The chair of the committee, Karen Bradley, disclosed that there were only 12 officials working on the government’s “one in, one out” deal to detain Channel asylum claimants and return them to France, in exchange for taking a similar number of asylum seekers who had family in the UK. This was compared with more than 1,000 officials working on the previous government’s Rwanda deal, she said. Hewitt responded by saying the new deal involved many more people working across enforcement and immigration, and that smashing the smuggling gangs would take time. Hewitt said: “I think there has previously been the view that that there is one thing, or one or two things, that will provide the answer. I very firmly believe that that’s not the case. This is an established criminality. It’s an incredibly profitable criminality, and there are increasingly numbers of people who are in a situation where they could see the potential to become migrants.

a8eb5a3a92df,French prime minister survives two no-confidence votes,,"The French prime minister has survived two votes of no confidence that had sought to threaten to topple his fragile, minority government days after it was appointed. Sébastien Lecornu , a key ally of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, told parliament on Thursday that lawmakers must choose to take part in “parliamentary debate” on next year’s budget or sink the government and create “political chaos”. A total of 271 lawmakers voted in favour of the first no-confidence motion, put forward by the left’s France Unbowed ( La France Insoumise ), only 18 votes short of the 289 votes needed to topple the government. A second no-confidence vote, tabled by Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, won 144 votes. It had been expected to gain far fewer votes because it did not have the support of France Unbowed. Although the government survived, the fact that the first vote was closer than expected highlighs the difficulties faced by Lecornu as he prepares for months of debate over next year’s budget. The government owes its survival to the Socialist party leadership , which held back from joining the France Unbowed vote after Lecornu said he would suspend Macron’s landmark pension changes . The move to freeze the changes, which had begun to raise the pension age from 62 to 64 over several years, was a significant concession. Nonetheless, seven lawmakers from the Socialist parliament group broke ranks with the party leadership and voted to bring the government down. Lecornu must now try to get a 2026 budget for the European Union’s second-largest economy through parliament’s bitterly divided lower house before 31 December. Mathilde Panot, the head of the parliamentary group of France Unbowed, said: “There were only a few votes lacking to bring down Lecornu and his government. Our first thought is for the country, for all those who will suffer the cruel politics that have been announced for the budget.” The Socialist leader, Olivier Faure, said his party would use the ensuing debate to try to unpick an “unfair budget”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ashley Tellis, 64, who served on the national security council of the former US president George W Bush and is credited for helping to negotiate the US-India nuclear deal , was arrested and charged over the weekend. According to court documents, FBI agents searched his home and found thousands of pages of classified and top secret records. Due to his employment with the state department and the Pentagon, Tellis had a top secret security clearance. Tellis is alleged to have entered the US state department and a defence department facility and to have “printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including US military aircraft capabilities”. The FBI has also accused Tellis of meeting Chinese officials on multiple occasions over the years and handing over documents in an envelope. Tellis has denied the charges. In a statement, his lawyers said: “Ashley J Tellis is a widely respected scholar and senior policy adviser. We will be vigorously contesting the allegations brought against him, specifically any insinuation of his operating on behalf of a foreign adversary.” Tellis had served in the US foreign service and is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, where he had become a well-known strategic expert on US-India relations. Due in part to his work at the Pentagon, Tellis had top security clearance.

af1721b38f0e,Californians wary yet supportive of proposal to redraw voting maps: ‘This is a tactical measure’,,"California is set to vote on a new congressional map in November, part of a plan by the governor, Gavin Newsom , and state Democrats to deliver up to five new Democrat-held seats in the US Congress. The plan is a direct effort to counter a Republican-led push in Texas , which will give the GOP a five-seat advantage in the upcoming midterms. The move is controversial for many reasons – states usually redistrict every decade after the census to better reflect populations, and California already has an independent commission to do just that. But the Texas plan, which was signed by Greg Abbott, the Republican governor, in August, came at the behest of Donald Trump , who has linked the effort as a surefire way to get five more Republicans in the House during the next midterms. The Guardian asked voters how they felt about California’s Proposition 50 . While many expressed distaste, or outright disgust, with gerrymandering – the practice of redrawing congressional seats to guarantee representation for one party – many said they felt the new proposal was the only way to ensure fair representation in Congress. “I have always been happy about California’s lack of gerrymandering and I hope that one day, every state will have independent commissions to create congressional districts,” Mars Moro, 60, an accountant at a California biotech company reliant on endangered grants from the National Institutes of Health, wrote. “But right now, with Trump’s attempt to rig the midterms in 2026, I believe that Newsom is doing the right thing. Our republic hangs in the balance and we must do everything we can to prevent a full autocratic takeover.” Tara Noone, a psychotherapist from Albany, said while she generally thinks gerrymandering is “appalling”, it would be “foolish not to redistrict when there is a direct request from the White House and direct effort in red states to redistrict in order to give the GOP more seats in the House”. “When the effort to tilt elections for a one-party permanent majority is transparent, explicit and unapologetic, we must act,” Noone, who has a “Yes on 50” sign in her yard, wrote. “Not just for ourselves but for all those voters in Texas who have been completely disenfranchised by a gerrymandering that neutralizes their votes. I have to hold my nose to vote for this one, but I absolutely will vote for it and feel safe doing so given the sunset provision.” Meghan Diggins agreed with the sense of displeasure at being at this political juncture, but said she felt it was the “right thing to do considering that in my review, it certainly seems like Donald Trump is trying to take over the country”. “I disagree with almost every single thing the man has done since he sat down at the Oval Office again,” Diggins, 59, said. “Even though I think gerrymandering is completely wrong and it’s ridiculous it’s not been stopped prior to now, it’s the only way to fight back for the gerrymandering he is pushing in red states.” But for some voters, the “fight fire with fire” mindset weighed too heavily. Alex G, a middle school teacher in Long Beach, California, who asked to only be identified by his first name, said the idea to counter Republicans was “inherently dangerous”. “As a young person, I still have hope for the future,” the 30-year-old wrote. “I have hope that we will learn from the atrocities committed during the Trump era and a new political climate will emerge. However, if both sides of the political system are bending the rules in their favor, where does it end?” Many voters said they were comforted by the fact that Proposition 50 has a temporary timeline. If passed, the new maps would be used for congressional elections beginning in 2026, but only for three elections until the state draws new district maps after the 2030 Census. “I don’t think it is the ideal way to do this, but to keep things fair we have no choice because of what Texas did,” Steven Reeves, 61, from Anderson, California, wrote. “But I feel better that it is only temporary unless the state puts a permanent proposal on a future ballot.” Samian Quazi, a registered nurse in Pacifica, California, said while they know the Democratic effort was meant to rebalance the gerrymandering in Texas, it was an unfortunate outcome. “I am no fan of gerrymandering – and as a political independent, I find a lot of the partisanship to be counterproductive,” Quazi, 37, said. “However, I plan on voting yes to this proposition. I grew up in Texas before moving to California, and I saw how gerrymandering in Texas made the state so uncompetitive in elections. It is only right to stand up against this, so if California can neutralize Texas’s efforts, it sends a message that such behavior won’t go unanswered.” Others, however, were concerned Proposition 50 was “a dangerous partisan act by Newsom to boost his political party”. “He is denying the voters the independent commission we approved,” Evan August Evans, a restaurant manager from San Pedro, California, wrote. “He says it’s only for the next three election cycles. How can we trust this since he is basically disenfranchising Green party, independent and Republican voters. We need independent commissions drawing up congressional maps. Newsom wants to fight fire with fire, but that just ensures everything burns.” California is just one of eight states with an independent commission responsible for redistricting. The state passed the Voters First Act in 2008 that allowed the body to draw new district lines, and expanded its ability two years later in 2010 to add congressional districts to its purview. The body is made up of 14 members, five Republicans, five Democrats and four unaffiliated with those major parties. The existence of that commission, whose work is set to continue after three elections, has helped get some voters across the line on Prop 50. “Passing Prop 50 is an absolute necessity if democracy is to be saved in this country,” Kathy Callaway, a 75-year-old resident of Woodacre, California, wrote. “This is a tactical measure in reaction to the illegal gerrymandering in Texas, but it is also a temporary measure.” “In 2030 our independent redistricting commission will resume its job after the census. I am proud of California for standing up to Trump’s authoritarian power grab.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/california-prop-50-voting-maps,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acbad2a4405188be0ae7b515144145ada3ddd8f/542_0_5417_4335/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9614b20efb4a47029f2063d425fbc5b8",2025-10-16T13:00:03+00:00,e6e52896064c3c6c4d324a046ce67746fb3857c4
e5d979e97a48,Trump plans to switch anti-terror funds from Democratic to Republican states,,"The Trump administration plans to shift terrorism prevention funding from Democratic-led states toward those led by Republicans, government records show, as it overhauls a $1bn program created after the 9/11 attacks . Twelve Democratic-led states are suing to block the cuts, alleging that the Trump administration is trying to punish them for not cooperating with federal immigration agents. The Trump administration released estimates in late summer for how much money each state should expect to receive from the program. But it later changed the totals, according to notices the states received in late September from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio, which Trump won in 2024, saw the biggest percentage increase among states, according to federal records reviewed by Reuters. Democratic-leaning Washington DC , Illinois and New Jersey saw particularly sharp decreases, with Washington’s total cut by 70%, Illinois by 69% and New Jersey by 49% compared with what the administration previously said they would receive. California also lost 31%. A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Fema, said in a statement that the new funding totals gave “greater weight” to threats from transnational organized crime, defined as criminal organizations that operate across international borders. It also accounts for “illegal border crossings”, the spokesperson said. The US Congress created the program, called Homeland Security Grants, after the September 11, 2001 , attacks by Al-Qaida to help states and cities prevent terrorism and other violent threats. While the spending is only a fraction of the money states receive from the federal government each year, it is the latest example of the Trump administration changing how routine funding is distributed to states the president lost in the 2024 election . In recent weeks, Trump also cut billions of dollars in funding for energy and infrastructure in Democratic states, including New York and California, carrying out his threat to target those states during the US government shutdown . “It is flatly untrue to suggest that these changes are arbitrary or politically motivated,” a DHS spokesperson said. “Adjustments in award amounts follow a methodical, risk-informed analysis with the goal of ensuring that every dollar spent yields the maximum benefit for the American people.” But Trump has linked funding decisions to politics, saying last week in the context of the government shutdown, “We’re only cutting Democrat programs.” A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from distributing the money until the court case from 12 Democratic-led states plays out. The Trump administration asked the judge on 7 October to reconsider her order. New York , one of the states that brought the lawsuit, initially faced a 77% cut in funding, but on 3 October, Trump said he had reversed that. He did not elaborate on why. The DHS declined to answer how the change would affect funding for other states.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/anti-terror-funding-trump-democratic-states,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46055b47eacb3bbaa8b5dd11d40a12bb169d308/410_0_4098_3278/master/4098.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89c119aa89a414e00c929a3481adde28",2025-10-16T12:30:31+00:00,631de507e786fe56f4190c47258be9615da3ab3b
6038f70278fa,Mexico president dismisses US claim of cartel bounties on immigration officials,,"Mexico ’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said her government has “no information” regarding claims by the Trump administration that Mexican cartels are offering bounties for US immigration officials. “We are requesting information but there is none,” Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference on Wednesday. “We learned of this, just like you, via [the Department of Homeland Security’s] publication.” Sheinbaum’s comments come a day after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed that Mexican crime factions were coordinating with US-based gangs to target agency officials. The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, later doubled down on the claims, posting on social media that Trump has been “so effective in dismantling cartel operations” in the US, that cartel members in the US “are now placing bounties on the heads of our agents”. But organized crime experts expressed skepticism at the claims. In interviews, a former Mexican cartel trafficker, two former DEA agents and a drug policy scholar all said it was highly unlikely that Mexican organized crime groups are directing US-based gangs to target immigration officials. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and other agencieshave carried out widespread immigration enforcement operation in Chicago in recent weeks, provoking a backlash from protesters and lawmakers over the heavy-handed tactics. According to the DHS, Mexican cartels have offered “targeted bounties” of $2,000 to reveal agents’ identities, between $5,000 and $10,000 to kidnap Ice officers and up to $50,000 for the assassination of high-ranking officials. But the claims were dismissed out of hand by Margarito Flores, a former Sinaloa cartel drug trafficker in Chicago, who said that targeting US officials in the US would place unwanted attention on the criminal groups whose priorities are commercial, not political. Flores did not discard the possibility of individual gang members attacking officials, but said the claim of cartel bounties was “ridiculous”. After his arrest, Flores cooperated with the US government and now trains law enforcement officers around the country on topics related to Mexican organized crime. “There’s the unspoken rule that you don’t mess with law enforcement. Period. [Mexican cartels] know the ramifications of that,” he said. Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations for the DEA who worked in Mexico for years, also rejected the claims. “The cartels are not going to target Ice and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] because it would bring more heat on them,” said Vigil. “It would hamper their organizations, in terms of funneling drugs into the United States.” The origin of the allegations remains murky. Earlier this month a DHS press release , alleged that an informant told authorities that a Latin Kings member had put out a “hit” on the border patrol chief, Gregory Bovino. But the DHS has not provided any evidence that the alleged “hit” came from a Mexican organized crime group. According to Flores, local gangs like the Latin Kings have limited affiliations with Mexican criminal groups. “They might be customers of the drug cartels – but they are their own organization run by gang members. Cartels don’t have authority.” Although Mexican organized crime groups do use extreme violence to protect their drug trafficking routes and business, attacks on US law enforcement officials – especially in the US – are rare. “We have very limited information [about the alleged threat],” said Nathan P Jones, an associate professor of security studies at Sam Houston State University. “I am immediately skeptical that this is an actual threat.” Mexican crime groups have targeted US officials in Mexico, including a notorious case from the 1980s currently playing out in a US federal court. In 1985, the Guadalajara cartel kidnapped, tortured and killed DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in Guadalajara. That murder prompted the largest ever homicide investigation by the DEA, which even deployed bounty hunters to capture several of the suspects. The crackdown eventually led to the fracturing and dissolution of the Guadalajara cartel, and one of the cartel leaders allegedly responsible for the case is currently being prosecuted in a New York court. According to Flores and Jones, the Camarena case taught Mexican organized crime groups a lesson: do not target US officials. Vigil specifies that the Trump administration is trying to push false accusations to justify its political agenda, fomenting fear in order to “normalize putting Ice agents, acting as his Gestapo, on the streets of the United States”. Flores warned that such rumors will directly worsen an already volatile situation. “Imagine you’re in the field,” Flores said. “And now it’s in the back of your head that you’ve got a bounty. “The next thing you know, every cellphone is going to be a gun.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/mexico-sheinbaum-cartel-bounties-immigration-officials,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4be7b1251d8b7c7060c739875608501fd3b733b/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42e50e6cbff7d24a4ffb622e034ba7af",2025-10-16T11:28:29+00:00,481d5c63b79dfe59f1918cf50eaaeb2d804627f3

0f398b4257be,Americans’ pessimism about the economy cuts across political lines,,"Donald Trump is not making America feel great again. Nine months into the second Trump administration , Americans are feeling pretty crummy. More than half – 53% – believe the economy is worsening, according to the latest survey conducted by Harris for the Guardian. That’s just slightly better than the 58% who thought it was going downhill in late April, when financial markets were still reeling from the president’s “liberation day” tariffs. About 60% think the cost of living has gotten worse since the start of the year; 47% say the job market is worse. There is a partisan bias to responses, of course. Only 24% of Republicans think the economy is deteriorating, compared with 60% of independents and 67% of Democrats . But there are ominous signs that the bad vibes are seeping into the bloodstream of the Maga base. Half of rural Americans, who voted for Trump by the stupendous margin of 69% to 29% last November, have become more pessimistic about the state of the economy since the start of the summer. Bad vibes are starting to pollute their aspirations. More than a third (38%) of rural Americans say they are more pessimistic about their ability to achieve the American dream than they were a few months ago, while only 25% are more optimistic. By contrast, urban Americans – who, according to Trump, should be cowering under their beds, desperately awaiting the national guard to rescue their cities from crime and squalor – have become more optimistic than pessimistic by a margin of 41% to 28%. Pessimism is also beating optimism by 38% to 26% among Americans with less than a four-year college degree, another bastion of the Maga base, who voted for the president by a margin of 56% to 42%. Americans with at least a bachelor’s degree are feeling sunnier: 43% report more optimism and only 26% more pessimism about their odds. The Guardian’s polling is consistent with other sources, such as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index – which shows a sharp deterioration since the beginning of the year. It also poses somewhat of a conundrum, for American gloom is in tension with Americans’ immediate economic reality. Though it has slowed somewhat from last year, the US economy is growing at a steady clip. While somewhat higher than last year, the unemployment rate still remains just slightly over 4%, near its historical lows. The sharpest contrast is that between Americans’ pessimism and the blistering performance of the stock market. Despite Trump’s destabilizing effect on financial markets, the S&P 500 is up by about 13% this year, driven by the surge in investment in and enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI). This is providing a healthy boost to household balance sheets. Still, 37% of respondents to the Guardian poll reported that their financial security was getting worse, while only 25% said it was getting better. Some commentators suggest the disconnect between a tech-driven stock market boom and Americans’ financial gloom might be due to the nature of the technology driving it. During the dotcom boom, the previous era of tech-powered financial extravagance, people were excited about all the new things the internet would bring about. Today the message from Silicon Valley to the great unwashed is that AI is coming for all our jobs, and perhaps human civilization itself. I would argue for more mundane explanations. To begin with, what prosperity we see is driven by a very narrow set of companies – seven, to be precise – which are investing hand over fist to develop ever more powerful AI models. Beyond these seven, business investment is weak. While unemployment has not risen, employment has barely grown in the last few months. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His erratic policymaking has delivered powerful blows to salient parts of the economy. China has responded to the barrage of American tariffs by cutting off access to rare earth minerals and sharply curtailing its purchases of soybeans from the US, hurting farmers across the midwest. Moreover, Trump’s own Department of Labor is warning that the crackdown on immigration is creating a labor crunch in the fields that threatens the food supply. Beyond the policies, Trump’s peculiar affinity for stoking indignation and resentment surely cannot help. Not a day passes that the president fails to convince his fellow citizens they are living through hell: foreign countries are abusing Americans by selling them cheap stuff. Migrant workers are bringing desolation to their communities. DEI. policies and liberal universities are brainwashing them. Democratic-run cities, meaning most of them, are cesspits of crime. And the economy is being destroyed by a recalcitrant Fed that doesn’t do the president’s bidding. One might expect a rational politician who promised to shut down the US border would take a victory lap and offer some happy talk about his success at slashing the number of immigrants to a historical low . (A sane politician might de-emphasize the fight against immigration: only 11% of Americans think immigration amounts to the biggest risk to the economy, according to the Guardian poll. That’s fewer even than the 12% who believe income inequality is the top threat.) That wouldn’t fit Trump’s style, though. He must keep ratcheting up the heat, repeatedly claiming the United States is under siege by murderous people from abroad. He is sending the national guard on to the streets of Democratic cities and threatening more military deployments on American soil. Given the mood in the air, one might forgive the average American for taking a grim view.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/american-economic-pessimism-political-division,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49bb0591efb70e9cb2912208a2d0f711fd5a252/232_0_3662_2929/master/3662.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ac2afa7e98223c880d0be83521a4ad3",2025-10-16T11:00:04+00:00,0983df83080c5cdb69366eb643b7e63217ee51b9
c9f1a7c2a54c,Spotify partnering with multinational music companies to develop ‘responsible’ AI products,,"Spotify has announced it is teaming up with the world’s biggest music companies to develop “responsible” artificial intelligence products that respect artists’ copyright. The market-leading music streamer is collaborating with the Sony, Universal and Warner music groups – whose combined rosters feature artists including Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift – to create new AI features. Spotify did not give details of what the new products would entail, but the company said artists would not be forced to participate and their copyright would not be violated. In a blogpost announcing the agreement, Spotify referred pointedly to a move-fast-and-break-things approach to copyright in some parts of the tech industry. The tension between the music industry and some tech firms has already led to three major labels suing AI companies whose tools create music from user prompts. “Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished,” said Spotify. “We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation.” The issue of copyright – a legal right that prevents others from using your work without permission – has become a battleground between the creative industries and the tech sector , which has been using publicly available, copyright-protected data to build artificial intelligence tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude . The three music majors are suing two AI music startups , Udio and Suno, for alleged copyright infringement, amid similar lawsuits in other areas of the media and creative world. Both Udio and Suno have said their technology is designed to generate new musical output and does not reproduce specific artists’ work. The head of Universal Music Group, Sir Lucian Grainge, wrote in a memo to staff this week that Universal will seek an artist’s consent before licensing use of an artist’s voice or existing songs to an AI company. One of the most notorious musical deepfakes was published in 2023. Heart on My Sleeve, a song featuring AI-made vocals purporting to be Drake and the Weeknd , was pulled from streaming services after Universal, which represented both artists, criticised the song for “infringing content created with generative AI”. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Spotify, which has 276 million paying subscribers, said it has begun building a state-of-the-art generative AI research lab to create “breakthrough experiences” for fans and artists. The Stockholm-based company said the products would create new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, ensuring they are “properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions”. Spotify is also partnering with Merlin, a digital rights company for independent record labels, and Believe , a French digital music label, as part of the AI collaboration. Spotify already uses AI to create playlists and a personalised DJ. The heads of the three majors welcomed the agreement, with the chair of Sony Music Group, Rob Stringer, saying that there must “direct licensing” of artists’ work before a new product is launched. Universal’s Grainge said he wanted a “thriving commercial landscape” in which the music industry and tech companies can flourish. The head of Warner Music Group, Robert Kyncl, expressed approval for Spotify’s “thoughtful AI guardrails”.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/16/spotify-ai-products-partnering-multinational-music-companies,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e685191b521b5d0ebbdca3ac7a9d0d9cb746b3ba/46_0_2767_2214/master/2767.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c3964194d6d8f0b1103a6cc86274a43",2025-10-16T12:49:22+00:00,eca5ce471c1e93d7b2e56e91929941d2b70a68c5

04425d3b4395,"ROG Xbox Ally X review – like nothing handheld gaming has seen before, for better or worse",,"T he ROG Xbox Ally X, the handheld console collaboration from Asus and Microsoft, is an impressive, yet expensive, piece of gaming tech. The pricier of the two portable gaming devices dropping on 16 October, the all-black ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you a cool £799 (€899/$999/A$1599) to sample its splendour. (The less powerful ROG Xbox Ally, which comes in white, will run you £499/€599/$599/A$999.) Thankfully, the pricier option has said splendour in spades. I’ve put the ROG Xbox Ally X through its paces for the last few weeks, playing indie darlings and massive role-playing games throughout my apartment. Though the price tag is certainly a shocker (the Steam Deck OLED, a direct competitor, costs £479/€569/$549/A$899 for its cheaper model), the power packed into this comparatively smaller frame (291 x 122 x 51mm) is like nothing the portable gaming market has seen before. That power, coupled with its ability to play Xbox games through cloud gaming or its Play Anywhere initiative (where purchases and process carry between Xbox and PC platforms), and PC games across various storefronts, makes it incredibly appealing to both Xbox loyalists and portable gaming fans alike. Though the ROG Xbox Ally X had a few hiccups during my time with it, and some user interface issues that interfered with performance, most of them were easily rectified and quickly forgotten once I was deep into playing a game. Playable at home or on the go … ROG Xbox Ally X. Photograph: ROG Setting up the ROG Xbox Ally X Setting up the ROG Xbox Ally X isn’t frictionless. Though the device will launch into a dedicated full-screen Xbox experience that mimics both the Xbox console and PC app, it’s still a handheld running the Windows 11 operating system, and it needs an update before you can get going. This took a little time, and with all the pop-up notifications and steps of the standard Windows experience, it feels a bit odd for a gaming handheld. For the first day, despite adding my Xbox account immediately, the device told me that I didn’t have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – the upper tier of Microsoft’s gaming subscription service – and my attempts to re-link my account were in vain. The next day, it randomly worked. It also struggled to connect to my home wifi after waking from sleep mode – though weirdly, this also rectified itself after the first 24 hours. Once I got my various accounts connected (since this is a Windows handheld, you can also download PC game launchers like Steam, Epic Games Store, and Blizzard’s Battle.net), the ROG Xbox Ally X ran pretty well. In a user friendly touch, it boots straight into the familiar Xbox user interface, but pulls games from the other game launchers, to ensure you can jump right into whatever you were just playing, no matter where it’s hosted. This can be an issue, however, if you’re playing say a Steam game, then jump back to the Xbox dedicated launcher and try to start a game through another storefront. The ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t automatically close the last game you had open, or even ask you if you want to close it, which obviously kneecaps performance. And there were also a few moments where it kind of hung, suspended, in the Xbox interface and didn’t respond to any of my inputs. There was also a moment where the handheld slogged through a download of a rather beefy RPG, repeatedly losing connection whenever it would go idle, forcing me to resume the process manually. But after a reboot, it sailed through the rest of the file download without a hitch. Switching between applications … ROG Xbox Ally X. Photograph: ROG ROG Xbox Ally performance The above issues can hopefully be solved with a simple user interface (UI) update, because when it’s not being a bit finicky, the ROG Xbox Ally X performs incredibly well. There’s a bit of sluggishness when trying to boot up at low battery levels (sub-15%), but Supergiant Games’ beloved roguelike sequel, Hades II , launches fast and plays perfectly with no discernible load times between areas. Meatier games such as Avowed and PC mainstays like Backyard Baseball run smooth as butter, with beautiful frame rates and very little load times. Though the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t have an OLED screen, I’d be surprised if anyone really misses it. Games look incredible on its 7-inch, 1080p display. The glimmers and glints of Hades II’s mostly stationary characters are a visual feast; I let out a soft gasp when the moon goddess Selene first appeared, her pearlescent gown shimmering blue and sea-foam green. Xbox and Asus cleverly routed some system resources towards higher frame rates, and it pays off when playing a game as visually busy and punishing as Hades II – at no point am I so overwhelmed by what’s playing out that I can’t make sense of the battle at hand and act accordingly. The speakers are also fantastic for immersion. At one point in Hades II, I walked past the goddess of the hunt, Artemis, who was sitting in a moonlit glade quietly singing to herself. As I moved, her song emanated only from the left speaker, telling me she was still there behind me, even though I could no longer see her. Those kinds of beautiful details really shine. As for looks, the ROG Xbox Ally X may be initially odd – it’s like someone cut an Xbox controller in half and then soldered a screen between its grips – but the matt black finish is incredibly sleek, and the adjustable LEDs that ring the joysticks offer just the right amount of gamer-style finish. Powerful hardware … ROG Xbox Ally X. Photograph: ROG Gaming on the go, or on the couch During my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X, I’ve played it lying prone in bed, propped up on the couch, leaning on the counter while waiting for pasta water to boil, and at my desk during writing breaks. After 10 minutes of hands-on time this summer, I wasn’t sure if the rather large handheld would be comfortable for me during longer sessions. But actually, holding it is comfortable even after a couple of hours of playtime. At 715g, though heavier than the less powerful ROG Xbox Ally (670g) and Steam Deck OLED (640g), the weight difference is negligible, especially because the controller-inspired grips are incredibly ergonomic. The only time I felt uncomfortable was after sitting with it held up above me on the couch with no elbow or wrist support; then, my pinkies got a little sore from holding its weight. The battery life is great (coming in at 80Wh, more than the ROG Xbox Ally’s 60Wh), considering what’s under the hood. I could play Hades II for two hours straight with no issue, including a run that lasted 20 minutes at 22%, which only dropped the battery to 10%. Although parts of the handheld got a little warm during especially long play sessions, it was never excessively hot. ROG Xbox Ally X’s game library As for games, the device cleverly leverages the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which reflects Microsoft’s recent push for you to access its games, including a library of 1,000 purchasable Xbox and Xbox Game Pass subscription games across multiple devices, such as on PC, Xbox consoles, and now ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, with your progress intact. As someone who once owned a Steam Deck, and who has had an Xbox Game Pass for years, the ROG Xbox Ally X is my platonic ideal for a handheld console. I prefer the way Xbox controllers feel in my hands, and this device mimics that. I enjoy dipping into the Xbox Game Pass library to try out a new game, and this device lets me take that on the go – and if it’s a Play Anywhere title, which most games are, I also don’t need to worry about having internet access to enjoy it. If you’ve got the funds and are in the market for a powerful gaming handheld that can not only play PC games from a digital store of your choosing, but also an impressive suite of Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally X would be a good end of year splurge.",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/16/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-like-nothing-handheld-gaming-has-seen-before,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51ab88c3d2532850102314450f693fee2089a58/726_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08fc9ab2fe244fd31cc9dfa2ffa1c64a",2025-10-16T13:21:05+00:00,fae9adc15b53bdf32fcc8d16f9b9db551e3d7e24

ebd9053a2363,‘People’s opinions aren’t going to pay me’: Ireland’s Shane Ryan on his decision to join Enhanced Games,,"W hen Shane Ryan agreed to participate in the Enhanced Games – where performance-enhancing drugs are encouraged – he did not agonise: “I was like, you know what, let me do something for me for once. Let me make some money.” The swimmer represented Ireland at three Olympics , in 2016, 2020 and 2024, but all those years of training and sacrifice were not paying the bills, so this week he announced he would compete at the controversial sporting event. “My whole 20s I gave to Ireland ,” says Ryan, 31, from a training camp in Las Vegas, where the tournament will take place. “Olympic athletes train so hard all their life and they just don’t get paid.” Irish sporting authorities, commentators and even the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, condemned Ryan’s decision, but he is unrepentant. “At the end of the day, people’s opinions aren’t going to pay me. They’re not going to help me set up my future.” The International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency have also condemned the Enhanced Games – calling them a betrayal of sporting values and dangerous to health – but Ryan, who recently retired from competitive swimming, is eyeing the prize money.

I need to be very, very smart with money because life’s getting a lot more expensive.” It is a blunt and prosaic response to the uproar over the Olympics-style event that will debut next May in Las Vegas where athletes will be allowed, and in some cases incentivised, to use banned substances under medical supervision. Organisers cast it as a radical alternative to traditional sport that will showcase what they call “superhumanity” by normalising pharmaceutical and technological enhancement in sprinting, swimming and weightlifting. “Our athletes exhibit integrity by enhancing openly under medical guidance, being informed and consenting adults, and ultimately the decision maker on which substances they choose to include in their protocols,” Maximilian Martin, the CEO and co-founder of the Enhanced Games, says via email. The tournament, which is backed by Silicon Valley tycoons and Donald Trump Jr, has announced a dozen athletes but more have signed up, said Martin. “We’re strategically holding some announcements to build momentum closer to the event. The full weightlifting roster is already signed, both men and women.” The Olympic silver medallist Ben Proud, 30, last month became the first Briton to sign up , prompting criticism from UK Sport and Aquatics GB, which said it was “immensely disappointed”. Now it is the turn of Irish officials to lament. Ryan grew up in Philadelphia and won medals for Ireland at world, European and university level and holds 10 solo Irish records. A solid, middle-of-the-road career – “nobody’s idea of a headline act on the global stage,” the Irish Times said – but his communication skills on social media and in interviews offer another asset to the Enhanced Games. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Shane Ryan after the men's 4x100m medley relay at  La Défense Arena during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty Images Ryan said he was proud and grateful for the chance to represent Ireland but had struggled to live on €18,000 (£15,600) a year and that “flaws” in the Irish swimming administration impeded his progress. “No one really gives a shit too much about swimming except for every four years when the Olympics come around.” Facing uncertain prospects at the next Olympics, when he would be 34, Ryan retired this month and accepted the invitation to compete at Las Vegas, where there is prize money of up to $500,000 per event, with a $1m bonus for record-breaking performances. “I will always and forever support 100% clean athletes when competing for the Olympic Games. It has to be protected,” says Ryan. The Enhanced Games had their own integrity, he insists. “No one’s cheating here because everyone is being transparent.” The plan is to relocate to Abu Dhabi in December to start a drug regime, then return for the tournament. “Everyone thinks that we’re on drugs right now but we are not. You still need to train.” Doctors will customise drugs for each athlete, he said. “We don’t even know where we’re going to be taking because everyone’s going to be a bit different. It’s not about gaining size. It’s about trying to gain strength.” Critics are “freaking out” but the Enhanced Games are here to stay, says Ryan. “This thing isn’t going away. I’ll tell you that right now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/ireland-shane-ryan-on-his-decision-to-join-enhanced-games,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0129d0e1a3d73fe6722501550b1cf754d357a69/0_37_4115_3292/master/4115.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=35d5e9993dcbabb3ac71ba70be5fe9a3",2025-10-16T13:08:03+00:00,ad3d26a7c62200095545522d7e78b8234f8df1b8
de04e56528da,"No Ashes talk in England camp, says Harry Brook before New Zealand series",,"Harry Brook says there has been no Ashes talk in the England camp as the tourists prepare for “a hell of a long winter” , with the white-ball captain’s determination to “stay in the moment” so strong that he has not even noticed the ramping-up of pre-series trash talk by David Warner and Stuart Broad. The England squad arrived in Christchurch on Wednesday after the three-day bonding break in Queenstown for their six-match series against New Zealand, which concludes in Wellington on 1 November. Three members of the Ashes squad were named in the lineup for Saturday’s first T20 with another in Zak Crawley not selected and a fifth, Gus Atkinson, joining the group on Thursday as a non-playing member while he works on his fitness with the first Test in Perth a little over a month away. Brook insisted he was “just concentrating on the first game here”, avoiding thoughts of the Ashes and the T20 World Cup that follows in February.

We’ve got an extremely strong New Zealand side coming up and that’s the main focus.” Cranking up the war of words before the first Ashes Test on 21 November, Broad has claimed England will face the “worst” Australia team since 2010 in the Ashes in response to former the Australia opener Warner predicting a 4-0 victory for the hosts, saying: “If the captain [Pat Cummins] doesn’t play, they might win one game.” Locally much focus has fallen on Tim Southee, who sits at No 2 on the list of New Zealand’s highest T20 appearances and played his final game for the Black Caps just 10 months ago, but who will be wearing England’s colours at Hagley Oval, in his role as fast bowling consultant. “He’s been our Test captain, I’ve played under him and have a great relationship with him, so it’s weird to see him in that kit,” said the New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra. “He’s a legend of a bloke, a legend of a player, so it’ll be interesting to see him on the other side of the fence. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

b91d433f29f8,Emma Raducanu cuts short season after heat and injury struggles in China,,"Emma Raducanu has brought an early end to her season following physical struggles in China. The British No 1 had hoped to put together a strong finish to 2025 to guarantee herself a seeding at the Australian Open in January but that is now up in the air. There is good news on the coaching front, though, with the 22-year-old and Francisco Roig reaching a deal to continue their work together in 2026. Raducanu retired during the second set of her match against Ann Li in Wuhan last week with dizziness in hot and humid temperatures, and later posted a picture on social media of herself at a doctor’s office. She said she felt better and chose to play the Ningbo Open this week but was clearly not 100% and again lost her opening match. Emma Raducanu receives treatment after wilting in the heat in the first round of the Wuhan Open. Photograph: Sky Sports Raducanu won the first set against Zhu Lin but looked lethargic in the second and had her blood pressure checked, while she struggled with a recurrence of lower back issues in the decider and was barely moving by the end. Raducanu had been due to play in next week’s Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo and then the Hong Kong Open beginning on 27 October, but has instead decided to focus on recovery. The former US Open champion has been feeling unwell over the past 10 days and has made the decision not to push her body further. She will now take some time away from the court before linking up with Roig, the long-time former coach of Rafael Nadal who she began working with in August, for a pre-season training block. It has been an up-and-down season for Raducanu, who experienced a difficult first few months on and off court, with her then coach Nick Cavaday stepping down because of ill health before she was left in tears during a match in Dubai after spotting a man exhibiting fixated behaviour in the crowd. She had won only three matches before at the Miami Open in March but a temporary coaching arrangement with Mark Petchey bore immediate fruit as she reached her first WTA 1000 quarter-final. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Sport in Focus Sign up to Sport in Focus Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She made a late decision to pull out of representing Great Britain at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals and will have bridges to rebuild on that front, while she won just two matches in four tournaments in Asia, losing from match points up against both Barbora Krejcikova and Jessica Pegula. Raducanu may have done enough to be seeded in Melbourne, boosting her chances of avoiding the sort of draws she has faced at grand slams this season, and she has given herself a good platform to build from. Having gone into this year’s Australian Open ranked 61st, Raducanu has elevated herself to 29th in the world while, crucially, she has shown her body can mostly stand up to a full season.

cc346103c5a5,‘Maybe it’s the most difficult recovery in history’: Gerard Deulofeu’s battle to play football again,,"T he morning light is still sharpening, training its beam through the windows at the far end of the gym. Around the walls, painted black up to halfway, are motivational slogans that have become common currency in training environments. “Go hard or go home,” one of them urges. “Hard work beats talent, when talent chooses not to work hard,” cautions another. Beneath the second of those messages Gerard Deulofeu stands in conversation with Angel Aceña, Udinese’s rehab fitness coach. They are a team now, working towards a goal that never quite stands still. It is 8.30am and, as always, Deulofeu has been here for half an hour. There has been a session on one set of weights and shortly he will cross the room for another, checking a monitor for the latest notes of optimism. There is not another footballer in sight. Just after 10.15am Deulofeu emerges from the dressing room area and sits down gingerly beside the Bluenergy Stadium pitch. There is a plaster on his right leg slightly above the knee; he has just undergone his monthly injection and, nearly 33 months after he last played football, the consequences are nothing new. “For the first 24 hours it’s … urgh,” he winces. At close quarters, the difference between the visible mass of his legs is pronounced. Deulofeu wants to create a miracle: for himself and for every player who, like him, is forced to handle the isolation and stifling uncertainty wreaked by devastating injury. “I know I’m trying something special,” says the 31-year-old. “Maybe it’s the most difficult recovery in history. If I manage to come back it’ll be more than 1,000 days. But I’m a guy who takes care of himself and I think I can do it. If there’s one guy to do it, it’s me.” Gerard Deulofeu’s problems stem from an ACL injury and the picture worsened when surgery led to an infection. Photograph: Marta Clinco/The Guardian He can remember everything about his 12 minutes on the pitch in Genoa, against Sampdoria, on 22 January 2023. Two months previously he had torn an anterior cruciate ligament in a game against Napoli, close to tears as he departed, but appeared to have healed sufficiently while domestic football paused for the winter World Cup. “It was bad, but not too much,” he says. Coming on as a substitute in the 77th minute should have lifted a cloud. “But in every action I tried, a one-two or something like that, the knee just went. I had to ask to be taken off. The ACL was completely broken.” So far, that makes a familiar story of ill fortune and occupational hazard. Many footballers return to long careers after ACL surgery; others are not so lucky. But Deulofeu went under the knife in Rome and, in the process, sustained an infection that darkened the picture immeasurably. It ravaged his cartilage and reduced his knee movements to bone against bone; the prospects for his long-term mobility looked bleak enough without football entering the picture. “It’s not like a usual injury,” he says. “As an old person it can happen that your knee is completely destroyed, and now it happened to me because the infection was getting worse and worse each month. “I knew from those early months that I couldn’t be back quickly. In every MRI I had, the cartilage had deteriorated. I lost my muscle, my knee wouldn’t flex properly, there was a lot to recover and it was very slow.” Cell treatment, where cells are transplanted from a piece of healthy cartilage into the damaged area, was the only remaining glimmer of hope for his football career. Deulofeu travelled back to Barcelona, where it all began when he joined La Masia in 2003, for the operation and was warned by the doctor that things might not work out. “I said: ‘No problem.’ I only had one chance.” That was nine months into his recovery, towards the end of 2023. The following June he felt well enough to start running, first on a treadmill then on the training pitch, but it was too much, too soon. He has not run since; he believes the cartilage is 90% healed but wants to build more strength in the knee to reduce the chances of further setbacks. “I need to be able to train every day, not one day on and the next day off,” he says. So those early mornings, the solo workouts with Aceña and other medical staff, have to sustain him. So does the idea that he will turn out again in Italy’s top flight for Udinese, who terminated his contract in January but have agreed to support his recovery and have kept the door open for a return. “They’re waiting for me,” he says. “Giving me the time and passion to recover. I really appreciate that they have helped me and given me this opportunity to stay here, working in this amazing stadium.” He feels settled here in Friuli with his wife and three children; it was the perfect landing spot when, in October 2020, he trod the well-beaten path from Watford. There had never been doubts about Deulofeu’s ability: at his best he was an explosive runner, a clever creative force and inventive finisher. Everton, Sevilla and Milan were lured by a talent who produced staggering numbers for Barcelona B and Spain’s age-group teams. To some extent he delivered for them all but it was in Udine, where he scored 13 Serie A goals in his last full season, that things really clicked. Gerard Deulofeu celebrates with Lionel Messi after scoring for Barcelona in 2017. ‘Now that I’ve had to pause, I can see how big my career was and is,’ he says. Photograph: fotopress/Getty Images “Now that I’ve had to pause, I can see how big my career was and is,” he says. “I’m really proud. I came from Barcelona: people can see that and maybe say you could have been more successful, but you have to appreciate I already played for Barça, Milan, won the Europa League with Sevilla, played in the Champions League, played for the national team and scored, reached the FA Cup final with Watford. OK, of course it can be better but that’s just ‘maybe, maybe’. What can I demand more from my career than all this?” It begs the question: why try to continue? Why rise at the crack of dawn five days a week, the first step bringing pain every time, before working on a separate schedule to his peers with no resolution in sight? He has made his money, after all, and home life is ceaselessly rewarding. “Sometimes I’m thinking that,” he says. “Thoughts pop up that say: ‘Oh Gerard, finish, just finish because you already made a good career and have a family.’ But if I say to my wife that it’s too difficult and I don’t think I’ll be back, she says: ‘Let’s try, you’re going to do it.’ skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I’m trying, but of course there are days when the thoughts are bad.” The noise of lawnmowers briefly interrupts. The previous day, Udinese drew with Cagliari here and could certainly have done with Deulofeu’s wit in the final third. He limits his attendance at games: overexertion at the weekend would be unwise and, for one thing, climbing too many stairs remains a hindrance. “But I came here with my son a couple of weeks ago,” he says. “He was really young when I last played. We watched the match and he was just asking me: ‘When? When are you back?’ I’m trying, I’m trying!” Gerard Deulofeu scores the goal against Wolves that took Watford to the FA Cup final in 2019. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters Udinese encourage him to mix with the first-team squad, much changed since he last played, and help those settling into the area. There are dinners and the occasional drink; sometimes he will watch training. But recovery, buying himself whatever time he can through every moment of rest, comes first. Usually he will return home after four or five hours at the stadium and read books while using an oxygen machine. Then there is the benefit of moments usually taken away from elite sportspeople. “I can see my kids growing, it’s the most important thing,” he says. “You don’t see that when you’re travelling and playing every three days. That’s the good part of this.” Deulofeu says more than once that he does not feel lonely; that this endless furrow is not significantly damaging his mental health. There is a sense he needs the routine after the bulk of a lifetime spent bound to training regimes. He cites his friend Santi Cazorla, who is still playing for Real Oviedo at 40 despite almost two years out with an injury of similar gravity, as a constant source of support but discipline comes naturally now. “I’ve learned that I’m the one who knows my body,” he says. “I feel comfortable taking care of this situation. I have my family and an emotional state that I know is good. I know that my habits and organisation in life are sound. I have people sending me the right messages, and I’m happy. I’m a guy who loves waking up in the morning with good energy. “Of course, I couldn’t have done this 10 years ago. You need experience and to have the emotional part of your life under control. I’d have had to stop.” He understands that may still be the outcome, but also feels he has come too far not to see this through. “I’m preparing to get out on the training pitch again in a few months, and let’s see if I feel good out there. If I don’t, then maybe I have to take a decision. But I’m only 31, and I just want to try. I have time, the club is giving me time, so I don’t want to put a date on it. “I know that one day, if I’m playing out here again, this stadium is going to be completely full. I know how it’s going to be that day for this city and this club. It’s going to be a party. They know how much I love this club and how I played when I was available.

f5bb44ab2cc8,NFL hot seat index: which coaches are running out of time?,,"The Tennessee Titans’ firing Brian Callahan this week signaled the unofficial start of the coaching carousel. Six weeks into the season, a league built for parity is finding there is little to go around. Nearly half (14) of the league’s teams this season are two games over .500. Three others have winning records and another three (the Chiefs, Panthers and Commanders) are 3-3 with an upward trajectory. On the opposite end, six teams are 1-5, with their playoff hopes all but over in October. Only one of those teams (the Saints) has a rookie head coach. Callahan was the first coach to be dismissed, but there are toasty seats across the league. Mike McDaniel, Miami Dolphins 2025 Record 1-5 Career Record 29-28 For a while, McDaniel looked like the future of coaching. He was different. He was fun. He was creative. But McDaniel’s schtick has run out of steam. The Dolphins have the longest postseason drought in the league, and that’s not changing this season. After being blown out by the Colts in week one, you can at least hand this to McDaniel: his team has fought. Even after losing Tyreek Hill for the season, the Dolphins’ offense has been productive. But after another inexplicable late-game collapse last week against the Chargers, it feels like his time has run out. The on-field product has been poor. And the vibes in Miami seem as fractured as anywhere in the league. The on-field malaise has seeped off the field. In his postgame comments to the media last week, Tua Tagovailoa exposed problems in the locker room. He criticized players for missing or arriving late to player-only meetings, as well as the team’s weekly preparation. When players start publicly criticizing the culture , a coach is on borrowed time. Blame for this year’s debacle should go across the organization. It was owner Stephen Ross who decided to run it back with McDaniel and GM Chris Grier this season, despite little evidence that the two could field a playoff-caliber team. Grier has assembled another disheveled roster, patching together a lopsided defense. He placed all his chips on the defensive front, leaving the weakest secondary in the league exposed. McDaniel’s offense has shown signs of life since week one, but Miami’s defense has been so uncompetitive that it’s almost meaningless. The Dolphins have a manageable schedule coming up. But wins over the Browns or Falcons are unlikely to move the needle. They will only delay the inevitable. Whether it’s in-season or at the end of the year, McDaniel will be out. To finally end the 25-year hunt for a playoff win, though, the Dolphins will need more sweeping changes. Hot Seat Meter 10/10 Aaron Glenn, New York Jets 2025 Record 0-6 Career Record 0-6 Coaches are rarely one-and-done in the NFL . Owners are too proud. Executives aren’t keen to admit that they hired a dud. If a coach is axed after one season, it’s typically because of an off-the-field scandal or because they commit the cardinal sin: they make the team look incompetent. The Jets fired Robert Saleh last season, a defensive-minded coach whose pitch for the head coaching gig was that he would improve the team’s culture. That didn’t work. So Woody Johnson pivoted to Aaron Glenn … a defensive-minded coach whose pitch was that he would establish a new culture. So far, it’s been a complete failure. Expectations were low for the Jets this offseason. Somehow, Glenn has driven them down. They are worse defensively than at any point under Saleh, sitting 28th in EPA/Play. The offense can churn out yards in the run game, but cannot get anything going through the air unless it’s garbage time. More importantly, Glenn looks in over his head. He isn’t a scheme guru; he’s a culture-builder. He was supposed to restore accountability and competency to the building. He would say what needed to be said, and he would be on top of the little details that can be the difference in one-score games. But he’s continually flubbed his lines. He effectively quit on his own quarterback at the end of the first half against the Broncos in week six, then lit up a reporter for asking if the coach was pondering a quarterback switch. In all six games, he has bungled timeouts, struggled to grasp the basics of end-of-half situations and coached not to lose rather than trying to win. If that were all, Glenn would likely be given time. But it’s not. His own unit has fallen off a cliff – and he’s refused to make any staffing or schematic changes to stem the bleeding. The Jets are not a talented team. But with the current roster, they shouldn’t be winless . There is talent along the offensive line, a handful of playmakers at the skill positions and quality starters at every level of the defense, though it’s hard to tell at this stage of the season. Glenn has taken every opportunity to point back to his time in Detroit, when he was working alongside Dan Campbell. Going from laughing stock to contender was a slow build. Campbell won only three games in his first season as Detroit’s head coach. But even when losing, the Lions never looked unprepared or incompetent. The Jets do. Glenn can afford to lose more games, so long as the Jets start to look competitive. That starts with a quarterback change or an overhaul of the defense. But with a tempestuous owner, Glenn cannot afford any more management calamities. Hot Seat Meter 6/10 Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel speaks after an October defeat. Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP Kevin Stefanski, Cleveland Browns 2025 Record 1-5 Career Record 41-49 Stefanski is a two-time Coach of the Year who is fighting for his job, thanks largely to the failings of his front office and owner. The Browns are in rebuild mode, betting on their rookie class to carry them into a new era. They are stocked with draft picks for next year’s draft, where they will have a chance to maneuver the board to land whichever college quarterback they prefer. Perhaps Stefanski will show enough down the stretch that he will be kept around to see through the rebuild. He continues to oversee one of the NFL’s best defenses, and if the Browns can land a serviceable quarterback in the offseason, they could compete in the AFC North next season. Stefanski has proven that with solid quarterback play, he can piece together a good offense. But he was handed the roughest of assignments last offseason, asked to work it out with a creaking Joe Flacco – who has since been traded – or a pair of mid-round rookies at quarterback. That was always going to be a recipe for fewer than 20 points a game and a losing record. By the end of the year, Stefanski will probably be the fall guy for Cleveland’s deeper failings. The Browns will hand the franchise over to a new head coach to usher in a new era with a new quarterback. But Stefanski will land a job elsewhere. The mess in Cleveland is not on him. Hot Seat Meter 8/10 John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens 2025 Record: 1-5 Career Record: 173-109 (One Super Bowl win) The injury-riddled Ravens dropped to 1-5 after losing 17-3 at home to the Rams last week, marking the worst start to a season in John Harbaugh’s 18-year tenure with the franchise. Baltimore hit the bye at the lowest ebb of the Harbaugh era. If they can get the bulk of their starters back from injury after the break, most notably Lamar Jackson, they could still make a playoff run. But the odds of turning the season around are dwindling. Since the current playoff format started in 2020, only one team – Washington in 2020 – has started 1-5 and made the playoffs. Harbaugh has lived a charmed life in Baltimore. Even during the years when the Ravens have faltered, the blame has never fallen on the head coach. This year is different, though. Baltimore’s defense is a mess for the second season in a row. The group sits 30th in EPA/Play, behind the likes of the Titans, Jets and Bengals. Last season, the Ravens were able to turn it around at the midpoint of the year, overhauling their approach and bringing in outside help to streamline what defensive coordinator Zach Orr was trying to do. Harbaugh chose to run it back with Orr this season after falling short in the postseason. But it’s been a dud. Even before injuries took over, the Ravens’ defense was out of sorts. They struggled to get lined up, couldn’t communicate and couldn’t impact opposing quarterbacks. Harbaugh often gets a pass for a unit’s failings because he’s viewed as a former special teams coach and is billed more as a CEO-style head coach. But Harbaugh’s branding is a touch misleading. His background is in defense. He sits in every defensive meeting and makes the critical hires. It’s on him, as much as anyone, that the unit has struggled out of the gates two years in a row. With Jackson at the apex of his powers, the Ravens are operating on a year-to-year timeline. It’s championship or bust every season. But Harbaugh is now 4-7 in the postseason since he won the Super Bowl nearly 13 years ago. And he is facing an uphill struggle even to make the playoffs this campaign. The Ravens are not a rash franchise. And it’s tough to see who on the market would be a better fit for the Ravens than Harbaugh. But if the team fails to make the postseason, there aren’t many other levers to pull than changing the head coach. Hot Seat Meter 4/10 Brian Daboll, New York Giants 2025 Record 2-4 Career Record 20-36-1 No coach’s career is teetering as much as Daboll’s. His future rests on the arm of one player: Jaxson Dart. Daboll went into the season with a singular mandate from Giants owner John Mara: find me a quarterback. After messing around with Russell Wilson for a few weeks, Daboll finally pivoted to the rookie. And the early returns have been strong. Dart has brought electricity to a previously moribund offense, piloting the Giants to two wins in three starts, including a win over the Eagles without go-to targets Malik Nabers or Darius Slayton. Dart embodies everything Daboll wants in a quarterback: big, strong, mobile and a little reckless. While the rookie has been up-and-down in his three starts, he has undeniably brought a new jolt to the franchise. This is a proof-of-concept year for Daboll. He entered the season with the warmest seat in the league. But he finally has his own hand-picked quarterback. The schedule for the Giants the rest of the way is tough; their next nine opponents all have a current record above .500. The win-loss column will matter. It’s hard to run back a coach with 40-plus losses in four seasons. But Mara values stability and isn’t prone to rash decisions. As much as the team’s record, keeping or firing Daboll will come down to the environment. If Dart continues to show promise, if the Giants can snag another pair of upset wins and if the chemistry between the head coach and quarterback remains strong, Daboll will be given another year.

2f880b801f6e,Reaction when I stood up for trans women made me realise I had to do more,,"I n April, after scoring for Manchester City against Everton, I kissed a band in the blue, white and pink colours of the transgender flag on my right wrist. I felt very strongly about the supreme court ruling , politically and emotionally. It really hurt me, even though I’m a cisgender woman, and it still hurts me because it targets people within my community. I really feel part of the queer community because I grew up in a pretty small town in the Netherlands and didn’t have a lot of queer people in my circle or in school, and there wasn’t a lot of representation on TV. I never really felt a part of any community because I didn’t really know it was out there. Growing up and coming out and being in women’s football, which has a very accepting and open environment, and then moving to Manchester, I felt that I could be myself and I became much more in touch with the community. It has been a new, refreshing part of my life. After the supreme court ruling I wanted to spread solidarity, give them love and appreciation and cut through all the hate they were getting. The ruling made me put those colours on my wrist, but my feelings and thoughts had built up over the years to the point where I wanted to do something. The response was overwhelmingly positive. I got so many incredible responses from within the trans community – from trans fans from all clubs across the WSL, from trans people who love sports – but also from people across the world. I loved the allyship from other queer groups or straight cis people, supporting them and showing them love. I didn’t want to tell people what to do, because I don’t think that works, but I wanted to share my solidarity and I hoped it would connect people. It was very wholesome and if anyone was spreading hate in my mentions online I didn’t have to respond because people understood and would jump on it. That action on the pitch, and the response and impact it had, made me realise my voice is a lot louder than I thought. I underestimated how vital our support is for those who need a voice. I decided I wanted to help more, to give back to my community, and that I especially wanted to help women. It is trans women who are affected by the supreme court’s decision but it is an attack on women as a whole. So I started to look for ways to help and got in contact with the LGBT Foundation, which is based in Manchester. That’s how I became a patron for the foundation and I’m really happy to be able to champion its work. I became a patron of the organisation in September and on 3 October I announced on my Instagram the launch of a women’s programme called Levelling the Playing Field which I’m helping to fundraise for. The foundation helps hundreds of women get vital care, gives them a safe space and runs workshops around sexual health, domestic violence, sobriety and more. Kerstin Casparij: ‘I’ve been raised to greet people, whoever they are, wherever they come from, with kindness and an open heart.’ Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images In sport, especially in women’s football, we are good at inclusion and that is something we’ve prided ourselves on. I’ve been raised to greet people, whoever they are, wherever they come from, with kindness and an open heart. If I disagree with anyone, I’ve been taught to connect with them rather than push them away. We need more empathy in every area of society. That is really hard in today’s society but we have to do it. We need to ask questions such as: how can we connect? How can we make sure everybody feels included? How can everyone reap the many benefits from being involved in sport? In women’s football that is something we are really passionate about. No matter who comes to our games, how can we make sure everybody feels included and has a safe space? skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think my parents are a little stressed about me putting my head above the cornfield. Initially, they were quite worried, saying: “Oh, should you do that? Obviously, we love you and are very proud of you, but we don’t want you to get any abuse, any hate.” The hate is something that I’ve learned to filter, because I’ve accepted unfortunately it is going to happen. My partner, Ruth, and I had a video go viral recently and the comment section was just awful, but I’ve become a bit desensitised to it because those people aren’t important to me. That doesn’t make it acceptable for people to sit behind a keyboard and behave this way, and if social media platforms did more to tackle it, that would be a step in the right direction. But they can have their opinion and I don’t really care. I’m not trying to convince people; I’m trying to help people that need it. In my job, I’m used to abusive comments and messages, getting grief here and there, whereas for my partner it’s quite new so I worry more about how she is dealing with it. The audience for women’s football has grown significantly and there is a broader audience coming. That is great but it means the environment we’ve built for many years is changing a little bit. As players, we are very keen on keeping our values. We’ve put out statements against racism after games, for example, and it’s important to keep pushing and make clear that women’s football and football in general should not be a place for discrimination or hate. We are proud to be an environment that has grown a beautiful fan base because we are a welcoming sport.

4de1a86e4385,Bill Belichick built an empire on control. But UNC is letting chaos reign,,"I t used to be that there was no stronger brand in football than a “Bill Belichick-coached” outfit. For most of his nearly 50 years in the pros, the phrase recommended teams that prepared for every scenario, executed directions to perfection and met all the moments in between to secure victory time and again. But since the NFL turned its back on Belichick, who stepped down to the college ranks and took the head job at North Carolina seemingly for appearances, the Belichick-coached team slogan has become less of a mark of excellence than a bright warning label for a program run amok. The concerns at this juncture, still short of midway through Belichick’s freshman season, are overwhelming. The misleading record, the stark images of home fans deserting a blowout loss to Clemson before halftime, the dramatic talent deficit – those were predictable outcomes for a septuagenarian taskmaster trying his hand at coaching college kids. But Belichick isn’t simply out of his element. He looks for all the world to be asleep at the wheel, too. Last week the Raleigh TV station WRAL dropped a bombshell about the program that was rife with the kind of tittle-tattle and fault-finding that typically comes out after a coach is fired. The scathing report – which included off-the-record accounts from players, parents, coaches and administrators – paints the picture of a discordant program where Belichick recruits receive preferential treatment and parent concerns are ignored altogether. As evidence of the Tar Heels’ disunity, a number of WRAL’s sources pointed to Tar Heels selling their allotment of spare tickets for cash instead of sharing them with teammates in need. If you suspect that the NCAA’s eligibility enforcers might not look kindly on player-driven ticket scalping, even in the era where amateurs have been extended a measure of economic autonomy, well, you would be right. But ultimately it was cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins who took the fall for facilitating these “improper benefits”; last Thursday the UNC athletics department placed him on indefinite leave while it “investigates other potential actions detrimental to the team and University”, according to a school statement. As those events were coming to light, our Oliver Connolly – who, you’ll recall, was among the first to break the Belichick-to-UNC news – reported that the coach had initiated buyout talks with the school, and his assistants were scrambling for the exits in hopes of landing softly at college football playoff teams. “The rats are leaving the ship,” one unnamed coach said. A defensive assistant added: “What we’ve done to these kids is fucked up.” The palace intrigue at UNC has turned an otherwise dreary road game at Cal on Friday into the football equivalent of a Bravo TV series girls trip. When will the finger-pointing start? What will be the thing that there’s no coming back from? Who will be first to throw up their hands and huff, I’m so done! ? Belichick and UNC athletics director Bubba Cunningham have each put out statements reasserting their commitment to the cause, but the PR boilerplate has proven no better than a colander against an unstinting tide of bad news. Lost amid the rumors of Belichick’s UNC demise was Hulu scrapping its plans for a series following the team, a cancellation that comes six months after NFL Films reportedly pulled the plug on North Carolina-focused Hard Knocks series. The fact that these TV productions are no longer in being around the Tar Heels program just makes you wonder how much of a horror show the Real Coaches of UNC has become, and how bad the lot is for the kids in the locker room on a scale of one to Bishop Sycamore . “We just believe very much in the process,” he said in a news conference this week while addressing the rumors around the program. “Like [hall of fame coach] Bill Walsh said, ‘The score will take care of itself.’ I’ve always believed that. You’ve just gotta keep working and grinding away and that’s exactly what we’re doing.” On some level you feel for the Tar Heels, who let the winningest coach in program history walk to try their luck with the most accomplished coach in NFL history. In theory, the decision reeks of sense. That pro CV alone would be justification enough to hire another candidate sight unseen. But Cunningham and the school’s board of trustees should have known better than to sign Belichick to a five-year, $50m contract without really considering who exactly they were hiring. That’s not a shot at Jordon Hudson , the omnipresent girlfriend and handler who wriggled her way to the center of all the coach’s affairs. That’s an indictment of Belichick – the gridiron monk who preached against the pitfalls of off-field distractions, only to wind up turning into the biggest one. North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson look on during the first half of the game between the Tar Heels and the Duke Blue Devils at the Dean Smith Center in March. Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty Images Belichick hasn’t been the same mastermind without Tom Brady, posting a 29-38 coaching record with no playoff appearances in his last four seasons in New England. During that time, his apparent knack for spotting and developing talent rapidly eroded. The most promising quarterback prospect of Belichick’s last hurrah, Mac Jones, is thriving under new management in San Francisco. When Brady bolted to Tampa expressly to win a seventh Super Bowl ring and put some distance between him and his longtime coach, it seemed like a picayune point. But since Brady took the Patriot Ways and won a championship in his first year with the Buccaneers, you can’t help wondering who the mastermind really was as Belichick fumbles through his last coaching days. Whoever the Tar Heel decision-maker was that reckoned Belichick, a notoriously dour man who speaks in mumbles, would have charisma left to schmooze boosters and coach kids at 73 years of age clearly has no idea how big league football works. It’s one thing for a middle-aged Belichick to steer a locker room full of self-motivated adults who live in perpetual fear of losing their lucrative NFL jobs; quite another for an advanced-aged Belichick to leave it to a bunch of teenagers to figure out how much they need to watch film, reach their fitness goals and, I guess, attend classes too. Belichick’s coaching staff was supposed to impose their winning NFL ways on a wild and wooly college game, but they’ve proven no better than a depressing mix of loyalist and family members that report to longtime lackey Mike Lombardi – the UNC general manager best known for abetting Belichick’s infamous NFL flameout with the Cleveland Browns. Troublingly, no one on staff seems to appreciate that the difference between wins and losses at the college level are in recruiting. Belichick was supposed to be the coach who could actually make a credible case for playing football at a basketball school; he’d only need to flash one of his Super Bowl rings, they said. But in their haste to become the NFL’s 33rd NFL franchise, UNC higher-ups appear to have completely overlooked Belichick’s long NFL history of PR reticence, managerial clashes and cheating allegations. (Maybe the basketball team was playing?) One of Belichick’s first moves as UNC coach was to ban the Patriots from scouting his team . “It’s clear I’m not welcome there at their facility. So they’re not welcome at ours,” he said, even though he had just been back to Foxborough for Brady’s Patriots hall of fame induction ceremony. Belichick reportedly also banned UNC social media team from posting news about Carolina alums with New England, effectively stifling them from celebrating the former Tar Heel turned Pats quarterback Drake Maye. In the college game, coaches are held up as community role models for their young players especially – but Belichick teaches all the wrong lessons with his immaturity, pettiness and grudge-holding. Even if Belichick had landed at a perennial championship contender – Georgia or Alabama, say – one suspects the results would be much the same. Belichick may have built his entire personality around being the man in charge. But his last nine months in Chapel Hill have been a reminder that he’s cut players for far less alarming reasons and wouldn’t hesitate to fire himself if he were outside the situation, making the call. If indeed UNC and Belichick part ways prematurely, the divorce could get complicated and costly. Per WRAL , Belichick could give back $1m to get out of the contract or wait for the university to fire him without cause and collect $30m. And it’s not lost on North Carolina residents that most of this money will be coming from state coffers, as UNC is a public school. But if the athletics department were to find cause to let him go – for an NCAA rules violation or mistreating players or quiet quitting on the job, to name three examples seemingly in progress already – they likely wouldn’t owe him much more than a courtesy fight in arbitration. However the relationship ends, it seems highly unlikely that an NFL or major college football team would give Belichick another chance to run the whole show. It’s for the best. For more than a half century, Belichick has been a dutiful steward of the game and been richly rewarded for his service. But the time has come for both sides to admit its error, cut ties and move on. The longer this starcrossed marriage holds up, the harder it becomes to deny that what’s actually brought UNC football to this new low: the collision between a great man’s hubris and the towering gullibility of an academic bastion.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/bill-belichick-unc-football-collapse-scandal,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ff3fb085efcdffc99eb3f7fd8f4ad8c79b9439/486_0_4839_3873/master/4839.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01efcc836d173abeceb7772b4f7800c6",2025-10-16T13:16:19+00:00,34fbdf9001cfac7fbdbed68c441fd2f21c1742b1
e9977da4bb44,Long Covid Is Real — And It’s Changing an Entire Generation,,"I n January 2020, just weeks before the NBA shut down and Costco shelves emptied and Tom Hanks got sick, Joy Corbitt’s only brother died in his mid-forties with symptoms of Covid . Which meant, from the pandemic’s earliest days, Joy was taking no chances. She’d heard that Black and brown people like her seemed to be getting sick and dying at higher rates than other Americans. And that kids were either not getting sick, or getting less sick, or getting sick in ways we didn’t really understand. So, when it came to protecting her then-14-year-old daughter Lia, the North Carolina mother was vigilant. “I was consumed with the news — consumed with the numbers,” Joy says. As one week of lockdown slogged into the next, Lia, a straight-A student, struggled through that chaotic, ever unmuted, camera-off Zoom version of school. Which is to say, she didn’t learn much. With Joy’s husband James, a long-haul trucker, frequently on the road, the mother and daughter did their best to fill the time. They got a crazy Shih Tzu puppy named Zane. They spent long hours playing foosball and air hockey. They watched Netflix and cooking shows and Bridgerton together (yes, even the sex scenes). By the time fall 2020 poked its head onto the horizon, Lia’s high school was set to resume in-person classes. Joy kept her daughter home. She was anxious; it was too soon for students to return. But Lia, a budding theater kid, was eager to get back to her friends, to her life, to try her luck onstage. A couple months into the school year, after Lia scored a role in a production of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe , Joy relented. Lia “just lit up” about theater, her mom recalls. Joy figured, we had to let kids be kids. She took some consolation in the rules mandating universal masking. The masking, of course, didn’t last long. Kids. On an otherwise unremarkable day in January 2021, Lia came home with what she described as a “very minor sore throat.” She isolated, per school policy, counting down the 10 days until she could return. On Lia’s first day back, though, her throat was sore all morning. She threw up at lunch. Joy took her home early. “I was very confused,” Lia says. “I thought, ‘Am I still sick?’” “I thought it would go away,” she adds, “quickly.” It didn’t. Over the next three years, Lia would develop a perplexing, debilitating, and persistent set of symptoms. Extreme fatigue that turned mornings into catatonic nightmares. Brain fog that made memories slippery. Incessant vomiting. It all kept her out of class, stuck in the nurse’s office — or out of school entirely. The straight-A’s evaporated. Lia’s story is one I’ve heard from dozens of families over two years investigating the impact of long Covid on kids. It’s a slow-moving spiral: first their health, then their grades, then their future. And as the country throttles past the pandemic’s fifth anniversary, those for whom Covid looms very present are feeling increasingly forgotten, subject to pervasive skepticism and a kind of cultural fatigue when it comes to their illness. Lia and Joy Corbitt at their dining room table in Davidson, North Carolina. “When you have a disability people can’t see,” Joy says, “you don’t get as much empathy.” Eli Cahan The Make America Healthy Again movement has recently gestured at embracing the long Covid community. In September, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened two roundtables with the stated purpose of bringing long Covid “out of the shadows,” including by launching a “public awareness and education campaign.” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall — a physician with a loved one suffering from long Covid and who co-led the convenings — says those conversations were the first step to “take this invisible illness seriously.” But since the earliest days of the second Trump administration, the dollars that could help those suffering from the illness have quietly faded away. In March, cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) disappeared the nearly $2 billion invested in the RECOVER (Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery) initiative , hamstringing research that might have yielded diagnostic tests or better treatments. The same week, the administration shuttered the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Long Covid Research and Practice. In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center — the entity whose work laid the foundation for the Moderna Covid shot. In May, health officials installed by Trump overrode career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration to limit approvals of new Covid vaccines. Around the same time, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disavowed the vaccine for healthy kids and pregnant women. (“We’re now one step closer to realizing President Trump’s promise to make America healthy again,” Kennedy said in a video announcing the policy.) In the weeks that followed, the secretary also removed every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with a merry band of loyalists and skeptics. That committee has since walked back recommendations for the Covid shot. And since the committee’s suggestions only move forward with the approval of the CDC director, RFK Jr. fired Susan Monarez, whom he’d appointed to that role 29 days earlier, for her refusal to “commit in advance to approving every [committee] recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence,” as Monarez later testified at a Senate hearing. Then there was Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill, expected to boot tens of millions of Americans, including potentially one in five kids, off Medicaid. Where health insurance goes, vaccine access follows: Uninsured or partially insured children are less likely to get the shot, studies show. And unvaccinated children are up to 20 times more likely to develop long Covid. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment on how the measures taken since March could impact young people with long Covid. But in the leadup to this school year, these developments led experts to warn that Covid cases may start ramping up again. That could have devastating effects in an education system beset by plummeting achievement levels and an epidemic of absenteeism (more than 10 million kids, or nearly one-third of all school-aged children, regularly missed school last year). And for families already affected by long Covid, absence after absence is prompting threats of investigations for truancy that have led to children being removed from school altogether, either by choice or upon the advice of the district. “Millions of Americans are impacted by long Covid, and they deserve a federal government that will have their back,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said in response to inquiries from Rolling Stone . “The Trump administration is not only failing to achieve those goals, but actively taking us in the wrong direction.” It all suggests a brewing public health crisis for a generation of Americans — including people like Lia Corbitt, who, since 2022, has been largely in virtual education. That’s left doting parents like Joy disheartened. A decorative pep talk on the Corbitts’ bookshelf Eli Cahan “When you have a disability people can’t see, you don’t get the same level of empathy,” Joy says. “It feels like the world has moved on.” THE CDC DEFINES LONG COVID as a wide array of chronic symptoms — including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory changes, and sleep disturbances — that began after an infection with the virus and last more than three months. The most recent data from HHS estimated that, as of December 2024, around 22 million American adults had the illness at some point. More than nine million were still sick with it by the end of 2023. Data is harder to come by for children, who since the earliest days of the pandemic were noted to experience a wider-ranging and less predictable set of symptoms than adults. In February 2024, a paper published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimated that up to six million children in the United States had suffered from long Covid at some point. A year later, CDC researchers put the figure at closer to one million, with 300,000 actively suffering from the disease; it also noted the numbers, based on national survey data, may significantly undercount the illness’ true toll. Whichever figure you use, the numbers are enormous, rivaling conditions like ADHD and autism as one of the most common chronic diseases in American youth today. And for the children and teens I’ve spoken with, long Covid has done serious physical and emotional damage. It’s also hindered their ability to participate in school — something that becomes an all-encompassing source of frustration for children and parents alike. All of the students interviewed for this story were diagnosed with long Covid. And they all met the Department of Education ’s (DOE) eligibility criteria for specialized school accommodations because of their illness. It’s a group that’s ballooned in size: The number of children receiving specialized accommodations increased by 500,000 after the pandemic relative to before. There’s Alexander, in eighth grade when the pandemic hit, the adventurer extraordinaire from Massachusetts whose Covid-related exhaustion meant tardy after tardy — but who was denied accommodations because his grades were too good. There’s Eliza, a kindergartner in Washington state whose severe stomach pain constantly kept her out of school, but who was denied accommodations because the principal said that “we have great teachers here.” There’s ninth-grader William, a Mets fanatic from suburban New York, who was denied accommodations because school officials told him that “Covid is over.” Those struggles are despite a July 2021 joint statement from HHS and the Department of Justice clarifying that long Covid is a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But early actions under the second Trump administration stand to further jeopardize their ability to access special education. An Inauguration Day executive order targeting DEI withdrew federal support through the DOE for learning loss caused by the pandemic, including from long Covid. (The rollbacks specifically targeted special education for Hispanic, Black, and Tribal communities, whose children who faced higher rates of severe illness due to Covid, and who use special education at higher rates.) The Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likewise stand to dry up billions more in special education dollars. And should the Trump White House fulfill its campaign promises to axe the DOE entirely, billions of federal dollars upon which schools rely to support millions of children who need special education may vanish overnight. WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, the legitimacy of long Covid has been a wellspring of controversy. What the wide-ranging long Covid symptoms have in common is that they’re a challenging combination of persistent yet intermittent, incapacitating yet invisible. Too often, especially for young people, that means adults — even doctors — “don’t believe there’s anything wrong with the child,” says Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who is also the director of the post-Covid program at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “They think they’re being a teenager.” At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis. “It is hard to know if this kind of long-tail phenomenon is more pronounced or more common [with Covid],” Adam Lauring, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Michigan, told The Washington Post in June of 2020, “or we are just seeing things that come to our attention because there is a heightened awareness.” Other doctors have chalked up the symptoms to a kind of societal malaise: patient as emotional sponge in a chaotic world, sickness quite literally all in their heads. “Whether long Covid can be considered just a consequence of a viral infection or should be attributed to the implications of ‘the pandemic era’ we are now living in is still a matter of debate,” Achille Marino and Rolando Cimaz, pediatric rheumatologists at the University of Milan, wrote in 2022 in the journal of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases. Some in the medical community have even called for dumping the diagnosis altogether. “It is time to stop using terms like ‘Long Covid,’” John Gerrard, former chief health officer of Queensland, Australia, wrote in a press release for a March 2024 study comparing symptoms of Covid patients to those with the flu. “This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.” Another piece of the long Covid puzzle is a practical issue: getting diagnosed. According to Elizabeth Pray, former president of Washington state’s chapter of the National Association of School Nurses, who herself has cared for numerous kids with symptoms of long Covid, there are two major steps in the diagnostic odyssey. First, the child needs a documented Covid infection. Second, they need to find a doctor able — and willing — to make the diagnosis. But many kids may not have tested at the time of their infection, Pray says. Months into the pandemic, the U.S. faced severe shortages in Covid tests for everyone. Well into the winter of 2022, major retailers like CVS and Walgreens were still rationing tests to favor adults, who were at greater risk of severe illness and death. At various points, tests were restricted for kids under 16 years of age, and then under 12. Even in kids who did test, studies show that up to 90 percent of cases can go missed due to differences in how kids’ immune systems handle the virus. “If you have families that didn’t test,” Pray says, “how would you tie it back to know how big the problem is?” In the situation where a child does have a confirmed case, finding a doctor to ink the long Covid diagnosis can still be a challenge. According to the patient advocacy group Long Covid Alliance, there are fewer than a dozen long-Covid pediatric clinics across the country, compared with 400 adult clinics. That means many kids who live far from major medical centers — like Pray’s students in Moses Lake, a town of 25,000 that’s 200 miles from Seattle — won’t ever be seen at such a clinic. Dakota Presnell was one of those kids. Before the blackouts, the vertigo, the sniffle and the cough, Dakota’s childhood in the seaside North Carolina vacation town of Manteo was idyllic. Dakota Presnell on a dock in Manteo, North Carolina. He used to spend the summers roller skating and playing in the ocean, his mom says, before his long Covid symptoms hit. Eli Cahan He’d spend summers leaping off story-high footbridges and docks and jetties, and slipping down slides into the rollicking Atlantic surrounding Roanoke Island. In the off-season, he’d roller skate down deserted streets and frequent the laser tag arena or the bowling alley, playing one or the other until they closed up shop. Dakota was “a happy-go-lucky kid,” his mother, Michelle Hooker, says. “It was hard to keep him home… He was always on the go, always doing something.” Then, sixth grade. Winter, 2021. Omicron. Dakota had gone back to school in-person and — like many who contracted Covid’s most infectious variant — he was quickly bedridden, Michelle says. Of all his symptoms, the dizziness and fatigue were the worst. At one point, a friend told Michelle that she should “look into” long Covid; she’d bring it up time and time again with Dakota’s pediatrician, to little avail. In the summer of 2022, the blackouts started. Out of nowhere, like a limp marionette, Dakota would drop to the ground. Michelle “became his legs,” she says, as she’d carry her son from room to room. By the fall his fatigue and fainting spells were a “complete and utter nightmare.” By January 2024, Dakota’s symptoms also included memory loss and severe pain in his arms and legs that he couldn’t shake. Michelle says that, during this time, they went to loads of doctors — pediatricians, neurologists, the works — and racked up several hospitalizations where they were seen by still more clinical teams. They accrued loads of diagnoses: non-epileptic seizures, amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, functional neurologic disorder. That last diagnosis, in particular, irked Michelle. “That’s a fancy way of saying it’s all in your head,” she says. Long Covid, she adds, never made the list. To Yonts, at Children’s National, experiences like Dakota’s are no longer surprising. She’s heard story after story of undiagnosed patients who, by the time they make it to her clinic, have been seen by doctors who “think there’s something else going on, [something] not physical.” At the same time, Yonts knows specialized long Covid clinics, including hers, can’t see the vast majority of patients who request a visit: Their capacity is “woefully inadequate,” she says. “We’ve had really lengthy waitlists for most of our existence.” FOR KIDS LIKE DAKOTA suffering from long Covid, navigating school is a mess, too. Under federal law , any student with a “physical or mental impairment” impacting their ability to participate in school is entitled to accommodations under a so-called 504 or an Individualized Education (IEP) plan. The DOE’s language is deliberately inclusive: Such entitlements stand whether students are diagnosed with — or are “regarded to have” — any such impairment, William Koski, director of the Youth and Education Law Project at Stanford University, says. A table of contents for one of many notebooks maintained by Dakota’s mom Michelle charting his medical care and correspondence with the school district. Eli Cahan The accommodations provided under the plans can run a broad spectrum. They include everything from rest breaks to extra time to provision of quiet spaces for testing. They can also be more tailored: For example, for children with conditions that put them at risk of passing out — in which staying hydrated is critical — accommodations can include things like keeping pretzels or a water bottle at their desk. More intensive plans can include tutors or “changes to the curricular expectations” altogether. Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of school-aged students with IEPs has jumped. In the 2018-2019 school year, 6.3 million children received special education services. In 2022-2023, 6.8 million did. Still, some long-Covid families say they’ve been in the dark when it comes to accommodations. In some cases, they’ve faced pushback for seeking special education. That’s true for people like Lia, who had a pre-existing special education plan for ADHD, and who had, by then, a long Covid diagnosis. But Lia struggled to convince her school to provide additional accommodations for her fatigue, nausea, and frequent absences. After much back and forth, the school offered a compromise: She could have two extra days to hand in her homework. Oh, and she could go to the bathroom when she needed to. “That was really the only change that they gave us,” Lia says. “If there had been other options,” Joy adds, “they weren’t discussed or offered.” The obstacles to accommodations have been especially stark for people like Michelle and Dakota, who hadn’t previously navigated special education, and who lacked a formal diagnosis of long Covid. It took more than three years before Michelle realized they could even seek help. “[The school] didn’t give us any information,” Dakota says. When they finally did hear through Facebook about the possibility of a 504 — and started pinging the school to advocate — things quickly became contentious. “I’m battling the school,” Michelle says, “[because] they don’t believe anything is wrong with Dakota.” (Dare County Schools, Dakota’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.) To Laura Malone, pediatrician and director of the Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, part of the trouble around accommodations traces back to lack of knowledge around the illness. “Long Covid is a newer diagnosis…[that] schools, education systems aren’t as aware of,” Malone says. Michelle puts it more bluntly. “They don’t believe he has long Covid,” she says of the school. “They don’t believe long Covid exists.” AFTER MONTHS OF BATTLING, by the beginning of eighth grade in fall 2023, Dakota successfully got a 504 plan. Theoretically, that entitled him to extra time on tests and deadlines, as well as breaks throughout the school day. On paper, it was a version of school that retained a sense of normalcy while being feasible given his fatigue and brain fog. Unfortunately, the text on paper didn’t translate to real life, Michelle says. The plan “didn’t do much — he was still expected to [take] all these classes, carry all of this homework, do the daily assignments,” she says. “It was kind of a B.S., fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type answer.” In this way, Dakota and Michelle’s experience reflects a different issue with learning accommodations: the difficulty implementing and enforcing them. One of the biggest pieces of the implementation issue is that of dogma, Kathy Riley, nurse at the Plymouth school district in Massachusetts and co-lead for the National Association of School Nurses’ long Covid efforts, says. There are cases where teachers, much like some school officials, simply disagree with the notion that long Covid is real, or that kids with it need help. “The teachers have to buy into the accommodations…or it’s not going to work,” Riley says. “If a teacher doesn’t really agree with it, then the kid doesn’t get it.” That gets into the problem of enforcement, which typically falls upon the districts themselves. The DOE’s Office of Civil Rights “generally will not evaluate the content” of 504s or IEPs, the agency states on its website. Nor does it “review the result of individual placement or other educational decisions.” Instead, “any disagreement can be resolved through a due process hearing.” But a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the ability and willingness of families to pursue such hearings varies widely due to language barriers, ability to find an attorney, legal costs, and fears of retaliation, among other factors. Such barriers were particularly marked in low-income school districts, which on average have more children of color, and which tend to have higher numbers of children with disabilities. “Many parents feel they are at a disadvantage in a conflict with the school district due to an imbalance of power and so may be reluctant to engage in dispute resolution,” the report concluded. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about the inability of students with long Covid to receive 504s or IEPs, or lack of enforcement of 504s or IEPs in cases where they are granted. ) Recent reporting suggests that kids’ access to special education may worsen further following widespread cuts to the DOE. In March, the administration hollowed out the department’s Office of Civil Rights — including entire investigative teams in the majority of regions — leaving thousands of pending cases in limbo, according to the New York Times . And in May, ProPu blica found that, in the period following the cuts, hundreds fewer ongoing cases were investigated , and new cases were dismissed outright at rates 30 percent higher than previously. In late September, Maryland Sen. Angela Alsobrooks introduced a bill to exempt funding for special education from any future DOE cuts. “Any attempt to slash programs and protections for our students with disabilities is beyond callous,” Alsobrooks said in a press release. Still, by October — amid the government shutdown — mass layoffs were imperiling the DOE’s ability to administer special education, department sources told ABC News . To Dakota, politics shouldn’t play a role in whether kids with long Covid get the support they need. That’s true for teachers not following certain special education plans rather than others. It’s also true for government-wide initiatives that pull out the rug from under children like him. “People are inclined to their opinion,” Dakota says, “but at the same time, in some situations, like [with] long Covid…opinions get in the way.” THE TUG-OF-WAR AROUND accommodations comes at a time when fewer American students are attending school than ever before. In January 2024, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that chronic absenteeism — defined as the number of students missing at least one out of every 10 school days — nearly doubled following the Covid pandemic. Every state saw increases in chronic absenteeism, the study found: In total, nearly 30 percent — some 13 million children — regularly missed school. The alarm bells around the absenteeism crisis partly relate to learning loss. In January 2025, an annual Congressional analysis known as the “nation’s report card” found that American students’ achievement levels were declining to some of the worst in recent history . The alarm is also related to money. Attendance is one of the key factors that determines school funding in most states. That incentivizes schools to do what they can to make sure students show up, since absences can only hurt their bottom line. As a result, some districts are taking a punitive approach to chronic absenteeism. On one extreme is Missouri, where, following an August 2023 decision from the state’s Supreme Court, parents of children with poor attendance records are now liable for jail time. A more common mechanism involves truancy. States like Indiana are already moving to toughen truancy laws by introducing bills to tighten attendance requirements and immediately refer families for investigation in ways that can lead to prosecution of children, parents, or both. Truancy hinges on defining an absence as unexcused. But that’s a definition “really dependent on the school itself,” Christy McGill, deputy superintendent for educator effectiveness and family engagement for the Nevada Department of Education, says. For example, some schools may require doctors’ notes for every missed day, McGill says, while others do not. Studies have found that children of color were up to four times more likely to have their absences marked unexcused than those who were white. Rolling Stone contacted every state’s education department for this article, the majority of which did not respond to requests for comment. Most of those that did — Colorado, Kentucky, Oregon, and Utah among them — lack visibility into the reasons for excused versus unexcused absences. Such variability worries Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit organization focused on chronic absenteeism. “Unfortunately, across the United States, absences are too often deemed ‘unexcused’ for arbitrary reasons,” she says. The lack of clarity around excused versus unexcused absences includes those potentially related to medical conditions such as long Covid. Even as large-scale reviews of children with long Covid find absenteeism to be a consistent issue , schools have little insight into whether poor attendance in their district may derive, in part, from kids struggling with the condition. “There’s no question there could be long Covid symptoms out there we don’t know about,” Eric Mackey, Alabama’s state superintendent of education, says, “[but] I don’t have any information on that.” (The DOE did not respond to inquiries from Rolling Stone about policies for determining unexcused absences or the initiation of truancy investigations. The agency also did not respond to inquiries about how schools should incorporate protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act into their policies around absences or truancy.) Many of the families I spoke to, at one point or another, found themselves staring down threats of truancy. For some, those threats came via robocall after robocall. For Dakota and Michelle, they came in meetings with school officials. And for Lia and Joy, they came more insidiously. “I always wondered what my teachers thought,” Lia says. “They knew I was sick — but did they believe me, [or] did they think I was making it up?” So, when Lia’s medical waiver fell off seemingly overnight in the fall of 2022, Joy was concerned. If Lia missed 10 days of a given course, she’d automatically fail — if not worse, when it came to the specter of truancy. (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Lia’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.) “I tried to communicate from the beginning that…there is no way, at this point, she is not going to miss more,” Joy says. “[But] it didn’t matter. It felt like she was being punished for being ill.” AFTER MONTHS OF FRUITLESS morning wake-ups and early afternoon pickups, tardies and absences and missed assignments, months of blackouts and vomiting and forgetfulness and dozing off, Dakota and Lia were left with only one option: hybrid education. Education outside the schoolyard has long been considered the option of last resort, Koski, at Stanford, says: Keeping kids with their peers “is one of the bedrock principles of …the disability rights movement.” Based on how their accommodations were implemented, though, the families I interviewed say they felt trapped. In Lia’s case, even as her 504 entitled her to two extra days to submit homework, she kept racking up absences for not bringing it to class on the original due date. And even as she and Joy heard through the grapevine that other students across the country struggling with long Covid were offered additional services, such IEPs that included hybrid school with teachers coming to their homes for in-person tutoring, she was never offered such a plan. “Given how the school was handling [accommodations], and their procedures, and their rules, I really had no choice but to switch to virtual school,” Lia says. That switch came with its own costs. She was always missing out: parties, prom, homecomings. She kept finding herself on the outside of inside jokes. She lost close friends, who accused her of being flaky, or avoiding them entirely. “It’s still affecting me to this day,” Lia says. Dakota found himself in a similar spot when, this past summer — after Michelle finally had an opportunity to advocate for his special education plan — officials rendered a decision: Dakota would be enrolled at Dare Learning Academy, the district’s “alternative” educational option. It was the worst of both worlds: simultaneously denying Dakota additional accommodations and punting him further to the margins. It also felt like confirmation of what his family had dreaded: that school officials saw him as undisciplined or unmotivated rather than sick. To Michelle and Dakota, the decision felt premeditated: People “sometimes have their minds made up before we even see them,” Dakota says. It’s hard to know whether the experiences of kids like Lia and Dakota are becoming more common. The most recent data available from the DOE shows that the number of students in homebound or hospital-bound, residential facility, or separate school-based programs has stayed roughly stable since the pandemic. But that data doesn’t account for the kind of hybrid education that became mainstream during the pandemic. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from Rolling Stone about how students in hybrid school settings are counted.) The longer-term consequences on a generation of struggling children taught without adequate support — or via hybrid education — are also not yet clear, says Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. But, based on what she’s seen, she’s afraid that “every community is going to pay the price in the long run.” “We absolutely know the best place for a kid is in school,” Kressly says. In virtual education, she adds, “are we just putting them out of sight?” Some parents — like Michelle — are already observing changes in their children. “We’ve been beat up and chewed up, no one’s taken account for what they’ve done, and it’s not fair, because he’s falling through the cracks,” she says of Dakota. “As long as this goes on,” she adds, “his light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he’s losing hope.” Dakota, for his part, still has big dreams. He wants to live in a big city (Norfolk, Virginia), and work a demanding job (general surgeon). Dakota thinks he’ll be good, too: “I know how to listen and take other people’s opinions and worries into account,” he says. But Dakota also knows he faces long odds. And he knows how much his illness plays a role in that. “Long Covid has taken my life and turned it around,” Dakota says. Lia is also trying to concentrate on the future. After she got into a pediatric long Covid clinic and began implementing a variety of different treatments — salt tabs day and night, electrolyte powder infused in every drink, this and that medication prescribed off-label — slowly but surely, she has been feeling better. So, she’s got her eyes on the prize. A high school diploma. A college welcome weekend. Most recently, a beauty pageant title. Even still, life looks different now. In particular, there’s a void where her friends and classmates used to be. “I’m back,” Lia says, “and at the same time, so much has changed, because I’ve missed out on so much.” This fall, she was excited to make a fresh start at college. New place, new people, new her. A her that feels like the real her. Not the long Covid version. College “is a place where no one really knows me,” Lia says. “I can start over — and kind of, maybe, separate myself from the illness a little bit.” This reporting was supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/long-covid-kids-school-absenteeism-1235447552,Entertainment,the guardians,Eli Cahan,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/h_1599268427.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-10-16T12:00:00+00:00,118a1d610ef9785598bf5e9ca0d8482fe4af2c74
ace868d6e03e,‘Explicit and outrageous’: South Park is back with its most gratuitous episode since naked Trump,,"E ven outside its notoriously tight weekly production schedule, South Park has always run on an unpredictable calendar, sometimes taking years between seasons. This time around, it’s jumping from one season to the next after only five episodes (which, granted, have come in bi-monthly instalments, not counting the abrupt season finale that was pushed back a week due to a blown deadline). Tonight’s episode, titled Twisted Christian, kicks off season 28. At South Park Elementary, PC Principal – the PC standing for Power Christian ever since his politically motivated conversion at the start of last season – attempts to put a stop to his students’ obsession with the “6-7” TikTok meme, not because it is insufferable or disruptive, but because he considers it “some satanic numerology shit”. Rather than seeking help from the school’s new guidance counsellor, Jesus Christ, he turns to the world’s top expert on the antichrist: billionaire Peter Thiel . (The show’s caricature of Thiel – sunken skeletal visage with bulging bug eyes – is up there with Kristi Noem’s from earlier this year in terms of viciousness.) Thiel dives into the lore of the antichrist, revealing that God’s punishment of Satan after the war in heaven was to shrink his butthole down to the size of a pinhole, “so that [he] could never have a butt baby … until along came Mr Donald Trump , whose penis is so teeny-teeny-tiny it could actually fit in Satan’s asshole.” The size of Trump’s penis? Somewhere between 6-7cm. All of this is foretold in Revelation 6:7, natch. We’re also shown a scheming JD Vance, who seems to be the one pulling the strings rather than Satan or Trump. He is doing everything in his power to stop the birth of his boss’s unholy spawn, including giving his benefactor Thiel unlimited access to every government database while also convincing Trump to seek out an abortion. Donald Trump takes a back seat to other characters here, although several scenes are dedicated to his nether regions (including a couple of attempts at masturbation with the help of a pair of tweezers), making this by far the most explicit and outrageous episode since the last season premiere. ‘A full-blown case of demonic possession’ … Cartman in South Park season 28, episode one: Twisted Christian. Photograph: Paramount Meanwhile, back in South Park, Jesus suffers a crisis of faith after spending time with PC Principal and other Maga Christians (“You need a way to bully people and you’re using the Bible to do it!”), while Eric Cartman’s unhealthy obsession with the “6-7” meme turns into a full-blown case of demonic possession, replete with violent projectile vomiting a la The Exorcist. It turns out he may have the key to stopping the apocalypse. Jesus eventually gives in to peer pressure and embraces a Christian bro lifestyle, while Cartman heads to DC, where a face-to-face with Trump is all but inevitable. Even though it picked up from where the last episode left off, this had the feel of a season premiere, setting all the pieces in place for the remaining five episodes and what is sure to be a wild conclusion.

5403e97eb4a6,Kiss my face! Steve Coogan film performances – ranked!,,"Steve Coogan entered the unofficial British comedy hall of fame at the tender age of 30, when he joined four of the Pythons and the likes of Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood in this largely forgotten version of the classic children’s tale. Bedecked in a long scarf and wearing rimless specs, he puts in a respectably twitchy turn as Mole alongside Eric Idle’s Rat and Terry Jones’s Toad. In the comedy franchise about museum exhibits coming to life at night, Coogan plays Octavius, a miniature Roman general. Although it is, quite literally, a small part, Coogan makes the most of sharing the screen with Robin Williams, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson – “We may be small, but our hearts are large … metaphorically speaking!” he bellows at Stiller’s security guard. As Octavius, with Owen Wilson’s Jedediah, in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar Sold for $10m at Sundance, this quirky high-school comedy in the tradition of Rushmore and Election was tipped to be the vehicle that would crack America for Coogan. Instead, it flopped badly and went straight to DVD in the UK. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a bizarre, misfiring story of a drama teacher with daddy issues who stages an ill-advised sequel to Hamlet. Coogan throws everything at it and squeezes out some laughs – the highlight being the Rock Me, Sexy Jesus song in which he prances about in a vest – but he just can’t make it all come together. Released in the same month as Hamlet 2, Ben Stiller’s ambitious but exhausting satire put Coogan alongside some bona fide Hollywood heavyweights: Stiller himself, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black and even Tom Cruise. As Damien Cockburn, the floundering British director of an over-budget Vietnam war movie, Coogan seems out of place in this bombastic, largely unfunny film, with his character making an explosive early exit. Based on the memoir by Tom Michell (who last week denied historic sexual abuse allegations), this eccentric drama sees Coogan embracing late middle age as a depressed school teacher who rescues a penguin during the dark days of Argentina’s military dictatorship. His sombre, dignified performance saves this jarringly sentimental film, scripted by regular collaborator Jeff Pope, from cloying too badly. Coogan in The Penguin Lessons. Photograph: Sony Pictures/Everett/Shutterstock Coogan once said in an interview with the Guardian that just thinking about this ludicrous Ealing-style caper makes him “squirm”. It certainly wasn’t a worthy vehicle for a TV comedian at the height of his powers, but it’s still quite a fun way to spend 90 minutes. Coogan’s poorly conceived character is a big part of the problem: he’s a mild-mannered, liberal probation officer who somehow organises a bank heist to expose a bent copper. Securing the prestigious “and” billing in the credits, Coogan plays the Austrian ambassador to the French court in Sofia Coppola’s divisive period drama. He doesn’t have much to do but advise the young queen (Kirsten Dunst) to hurry up and get pregnant, but he shows he can handle a fully straight role – his first on film – without ironising the dialogue or indulging in Partridgean mannerisms. In a sparkling cameo, Coogan dons tinted glasses and an ear stud as Pete Easterman, an arrogant TV actor who has had spin-off success as The Windjammer, while the career of one-time star Richard Thorncroft (Julian Barratt) has hit the skids. Receiving Thorncroft at his Isle of Man country club, Easterman spurns his proposal for a DVD release, reminding him, “You called me a stinking ham on Wogan, with the emotional range of a chair leg.” As Pete Easterman in Mindhorn. Photograph: Netflix Alongside fellow northern luminaries Ricky Tomlinson, Lisa Stansfield and his old comedy partner John Thomson, Coogan lends his star power to this splendidly realised evocation of the Northern Soul dance movement in 1970s Lancashire. He plays the kind of teacher happy to write off his students as “mallet heads” and humiliate a boy by reading out the lyrics he has jotted down in a notebook (“Bloody hell, it’s a poem … that’s bobbins, that is”). Kicking off a superb run of films in 2012 and 2013, Coogan has a minor part in this clever fantasy about a writer (Paul Dano) who somehow brings a young woman (Zoe Kazan) into existence through his typewriter. Coogan joins an alpha supporting cast featuring Elliott Gould, Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas and impresses with his devilish turn as the sleazy, cynical author Langdon Tharp. 10. Greed (2019) Coogan plays the vulgar, bullying retail mogul Sir Richard McCreadie – all perma-tan and distractingly expensive teeth – in this heavy-handed but often hilarious satire. If only director Michael Winterbottom had stretched Coogan more and delved deeper into McCreadie’s curious relationships with his mother (Shirley Henderson) and ex-wife (Isla Fisher) rather than making predictable points about the iniquities of capitalism and the plight of garment workers and refugees. In Armando Iannucci’s political satire, Coogan plays an irate constituent complaining to hapless minister Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) about a collapsing wall. The whiff of danger is essential to the character – at one point he roars, “I’m not going to let a bomb off, I work for the National Trust!”– but takes on a disturbing complexion today after the murders of MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Coogan gives a nuanced, if oddly downbeat portrayal of Paul Raymond, the Soho strip club and porn tycoon who was once Britain’s richest man, in this entertaining but shallow film from Winterbottom that doesn’t quite make sense of Raymond’s multifaceted character: a highly driven, unconventional businessman, with a voracious appetite for sex, drink and drugs, who doted on his daughter (Imogen Poots) and was devastated by her death. Coogan pays tribute to another comic son of the north-west, Stan Laurel, in this gentle portrait of Laurel and Oliver Hardy in the twilight of their careers. Coogan and co-star John C Reilly look the part and handle the physical comedy in various theatrical routines with a deft grace, but the film’s attempt to derive pathos from their fading legends falls a little flat. Coogan and John C Reilly in Stan & Ollie. Photograph: BBB Films/Allstar In Jim Jarmusch’s anthology of vignettes, Coogan plays himself on screen for the first time and clearly relishes toying with assumptions about his personality and his ambitions to make it in Hollywood. Over the course of a deliciously poised 17-minute scene, he’s not afraid to come across as a libidinous, status-obsessed slimeball as he tries to brush off Alfred Molina’s screenplay proposal – and then comes to regret it. Coogan shines opposite Julianne Moore in this keenly observed modern-day adaptation of a Henry James novel about self-absorbed parents battling over their six-year-old daughter as their relationship falls apart. Deploying just the right kind of transatlantic accent, he plays oleaginous art dealer Beale, a man who whisks his daughter out of school early while on a work call and suggests going for “a double espresso”. In Michael Winterbottom’s suitably meta take on Laurence Sterne’s proto-postmodern work Tristram Shandy, Coogan plays himself working on a film of the novel, in which he is playing Shandy and the character’s father, Walter. We see him negotiating his way through an extramarital entanglement, dealing with an obnoxious tabloid reporter and sparring with co-star Rob Brydon. Their testy banter on this very funny film paved the way for their brilliant self-imitation games on four series of The Trip (also directed by Winterbottom and edited for the US into feature-length film versions). With an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Coogan and Jeff Pope, this powerful drama was a landmark in Coogan’s acting career. In the script and his performance as journalist Martin Sixsmith, he is at pains to restrain his natural instinct for comedy, allowing Judi Dench to get all the best lines as an Irish woman searching for the child she was forced to give up for adoption. The odd-couple dynamic between Coogan and Dench generates thoughtful reflections on morality and culpability, as Sixsmith’s indignation at the Catholic church is outflanked by Philomena’s pragmatic faith. Can I just shock you? I like Alpha Papa. The only feature film in the sprawling Alanverse, it isn’t universally loved by fans and there is something a little odd about seeing Coogan’s most enduring creation given the big screen treatment, with a hostage taking plot contrived to provide the necessary 90-minute story arc. But if it’s judged harshly by some, it can only be because it doesn’t hit the matchless heights of Knowing Me Knowing You and I’m Alan Partridge. There is so much comedy gold and “radio gravy” here, from Alan singing along to Roachford’s Cuddly Toy over the opening credits to the standoff on Cromer pier at the end. Coogan as Tony Wilson in 24 Hour Party People. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy After the fumble of The Parole Officer, Coogan got things back on track in Winterbottom’s free-wheeling, fourth-wall-busting love letter to Manchester and its music scene, brilliantly scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Coogan was perfectly cast as Mancunian Renaissance man Tony Wilson – Granada presenter, Factory Records boss, Haçienda owner and Madchester ringmaster – and brings just the right kind of maverick intellectual energy to the part. His scintillating performance at the head of a supremely talented cast holds the film together and injects a romantic nobility into this scabrous tale.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/back-of-the-net-steve-coogan-film-performances-ranked,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84187cc2133ae612086d75233c2238f581baba0b/636_45_2249_1799/master/2249.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=460e6ca1c30a71def9eb558038a1b504",2025-10-16T12:46:47+00:00,f43929032b3f39facec25f7ca70bab95bbf41660
ad76bdc8a0f3,Lyra’s last story – exclusive extract from Philip Pullman’s final instalment in The Book of Dust trilogy,,"Michael Sheen narrates The Rose Field Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/10/15/The_Guardian_Extract.mp3 She washed herself as well as she could in the little basin with its lukewarm water, and looked in the mirror dispassionately. The bruises on her face were fading, but she was tanned by the sun, and her cheeks and the bridge of her nose not far off from being actually burnt, so she must find some cream or ointment to deal with that. A broad-brimmed hat would help too. She spread a very little of the rose salve on her nose and lips, her cheekbones and forehead. Then she sat down and thought about Ionides. He’d been very helpful so far, but could she trust him any further? This part of the world was completely new to her, whereas Ionides was at home with the languages here, and the customs, and the modes of travel. Could she manage without his guidance? She could probably afford it. She still had most of the gold that Farder Coram had given her. Ionides hadn’t let her down yet, and besides, she liked him. The man at Marletto’s, this Mustafa Bey whom Bud Schlesinger had recommended. She didn’t know what to do. The alethiometer would have helped her decide, of course; even without the books, and without risking the sickness and disorientation of the new method, she’d have gained something from it; her knowledge of the symbols was much greater than it had been, and just to hold it would have given her thoughts something to focus on. And now it was gone. But she still had the glass, and the needle. If she didn’t find something safe to keep them in, though, she might not have them for long. The glass was merely a glass (she supposed), but the needle . . . She took it very carefully out of the pocket it was in, and laid it in the centre of a piece of scrap paper, which she folded over and over till the needle couldn’t slip out, and put it in a compartment of her rucksack. Then she thought of the old gentleman on the train, and the cards he’d given her. She took out the pack and shuffled it and spread the cards face down on the bed beside her. Now what could she do? The alethiometer worked by blending the meanings of three symbols. Should she pick three cards? Or just one? Or what? She chose one and turned it over. It showed a man behind a barricade trying to defend it from a group of soldiers, against a background of gunfire and bursting shells. She looked at it despondently for a minute or so, and gathered the cards together again. Ionides sprang to his feet as soon as he saw her come downstairs. ‘Miss Silver! Now I am your guide and guardian for the journey to Marletto’s Café. May I ask if you are hoping to see the well-known and respected Mustafa Bey?’ ‘How did you know that?’ ‘It was a guess purely and entirely. A traveller of your consequence would of course wish to pay her respects to such an important gentleman, and Marletto’s is where he is to be found. It is as good as a headquarters for his multitude of enterprises.’ She smiled – and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her face He held open the hotel door and walked along beside her with the air of a senior courtier accompanying a princess. He looked no different from the ragged and none-too-clean individual who had first appeared outside her hotel room in Seleukeia, but he bore himself with such confidence and brio that Lyra felt herself to be acting a part too, and enjoying the attention of other passersby. Most of those who looked at her were disconcerted, of course, by her lack of a dæmon, but she remembered the woman she’d seen in Amsterdam, strolling along magnificently indifferent to the hostile stares of other people, and she remembered Farder Coram’s advice too, to bear herself like a queen. ‘Mr Ionides,’ she said. ‘I am all ears,’ he declared. ‘From now on my name is Tatiana Iorekova. I am a queen of the witches of Novaya Zemlya. You are a magician from Prague, and you are in my service.’ ‘Ah! I completely understand. This is how I shall present you to Mustafa Bey, no?’ ‘That’s correct.’ ‘And what is my name?’ ‘Magister Parathanasius.’ ‘Parathanasius. A fine name, which I shall strive to deserve. How should I address you, Queen Tatiana?’ ‘Like that. Say Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’ ‘Not “Your Majesty”?’ ‘No. We witches live plainly and without ceremony. Ah! – Wait here.’ She had noticed something in the window of a dress shop, and went inside. After a minute she came out with a length of narrow scarlet ribbon. ‘That for me or for you?’ said Ionides. She smiled, which surprised him, and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her face. She tied the ribbon around her head, across the middle of her brow, and let the ends fall in front of her right ear. Ionides watched critically, and said, ‘You permit?’ She nodded, and he adjusted the ribbon slightly. ‘There. Very royal. What my name again?’ ‘Parathanasius. Magister. Like Maestro. Master Parathanasius.’ ‘From Prague.’ ‘That’s right.’ He looked around. The street was busy; it was a late morning in a prosperous cosmopolitan city, and no one knew they were in the presence of a queen and a magician. ‘All right, Queen Tatiana Iorekova,’ he said seriously. ‘You wanted me to guide you to Aleppo. Here we are, and you will soon pay me forty dollars–’ ‘Thirty.’ ‘As you say. When I take you to Mustafa Bey our contract will expire, not so?’ ‘That’s right.’ ‘And what then? The whole of Asia is open to you. What is your destination? Will you require a guide to accompany you there?’ She had already made her mind up, but there were formalities and customs to observe. ‘Master Parathanasius, this is not the right place nor the right time. A queen of the witches does not bargain in the street. When I have concluded my business with Mustafa Bey, you and I shall go to another smaller café and discuss the matters you raise over a glass of tea.’ He nodded slowly. His expression was serious, his clothing ragged and dirty, the scar across his face white against the brown skin and the greying stubble. He looked like a beggar. But he stood upright, his body was lean and tense, and his eyes were alive with complicity and, deep inside, amusement. ‘All right, we go to find Mustafa Bey,’ he said. ‘You come with me, Queen Tatiana, and my magic powers find the way.’ He strode along beside her for all the world as if he really was a magician in the service of a queen. Lyra was pleased with her own bearing too. Like panthers, that was the way Farder Coram had described the way witches bore themselves. She found herself thinking something unexpected: she wanted Abdel Ionides to feel proud of her. He swept imperiously into the entrance of Marletto’s, stopping in mock astonishment only when a white-aproned waiter said a few words in French, sharply, and barred his way. ‘ Vous nous prenez pour des MENDIANTS? ’ Ionides said in high indignation. ‘ Écoutez, espèce d’imbécile. Voici sa majesté la reine Tatiana Iorekova, qui gouverne le royaume entier de Novaya Zemlya, et moi qui suis son sorcier particulier, le gardien de ses finances, le président de conseil de ses affaires d’état, le Maître Parathanasius! Queen Tatiana,’ he went on, turning to Lyra and switching in a moment from arrogant to emollient. ‘I apologise for the ignorance of this low-born rascal. Please forgive him, because now he knows who you are, he will hasten to bring you everything you desire, and conduct us without delay to a corner of this establishment which is fit to receive us. ‘And,’ he added to the waiter, ‘take word to His Excellency Mustafa Bey that Queen Tatiana Iorekova will receive him at once.’ The waiter looked from Ionides to Lyra, from Queen Tatiana to Master Parathanasius. Ionides was bursting with angry pride, and Lyra held herself still and faced down the waiter with a gaze that came from the coldest fastnesses of the northern ice. Privately she was delighted. The waiter bowed nervously and led the way to a corner shaded by a potted palm whose leaves waved delicately in the breeze from a fan on the ceiling. Ionides held out a chair for her while the waiter hastened away. ‘When you’ve presented him to me, you can go,’ Lyra said quietly. ‘I saw a fountain in the square as we came through. I’ll meet you there in about an hour.’ ‘You don’t need interpreter?’ ‘I’m sure I can manage. Here he comes.’ Mustafa Bey was a large man in a physical sense, and an imposing one. His wealth was visible in the exquisitely cut cream linen suit, the hand-made shoes, the massive gold watch on his wrist, the golden signet ring on his little finger, the immaculately groomed grey hair; his power was manifest in the way he seemed to carry a field of magnetic force around him, compelling attention, demanding respect, knowing with utter certainty that his every wish would be not only fulfilled, but anticipated. His dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated. Ionides inclined his head briefly and said, ‘Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’ Lyra extended her right hand. The great merchant bent to kiss it, and Lyra responded with a smile. ‘Please join me, Mustafa Bey,’ she said. ‘I know how busy you are. I would be grateful for a few minutes of your time.’ She indicated a chair, and Mustafa Bey sat down. Ionides was giving an order to the waiter, who hurried away, and then Master Parathanasius bowed deeply to Lyra and withdrew. Mustafa Bey still had not said a word. ‘I was advised to consult you,’ Queen Tatiana said, ‘by a learned scholar in Oxford, Doctor Sebastian Makepeace.’ The merchant’s large and profoundly dark eyes widened a fraction of a millimetre. His expression changed from one unreadability to another. ‘And there was a friend I last saw in Smyrna,’ she went on, ‘who said that the one source of all the information I would ever need on my journey was Mustafa Bey, whom I would find in this café. One such recommendation would have been enough to make me come here – two, and I had no choice. Mustafa Bey, I am glad to meet you. Will you take tea with me?’ She could see the waiter hastening to her table with a loaded tray. ‘I would be honoured,’ said the merchant. His voice was unexpectedly light and gentle. ‘Mustafa Bey’s dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated.’ Illustration: Chris Wormell The tea was poured, the pastries were set out, the waiter bowed and left. Mustafa Bey was not going to start this conversation. He was a busy man, but he was clearly curious, and Lyra was aware that they were being watched by many eyes that were equally interested. She was glad she had not come to him as a petitioner, having to wait to be seen: this table gave her a little enclave in the middle of his territory, like an embassy, where she could command things, to which she could summon him, from which she could dictate the course of their encounter. It also meant that the initiative belonged to her: she must get on with it. ‘As I mentioned, Mustafa Bey,’ she said, ‘I’m on a journey. I want to travel to the desert of Karamakan, and I would like to ask the advice of someone who knows the Silk Roads as well as anyone alive.’ ‘My advice would be a single word: Don’t.’ ‘I shall bear that in mind, but I won’t take it. I’m determined to go.’ ‘What do you think you will find there?’ ‘A red building that contains something of immense value.’ ‘And what is that? Do you know what is in this red building?’ ‘Yes, I believe I do.’ ‘And you still want to go there, and put your life in danger, and risk not being able to return?’ ‘Yes.’ He sipped the hot tea. Despite his bulk, all his movements were delicate and graceful. ‘I have never been to the red building myself,’ he said, ‘but I know the conditions under which it must be approached. The traveller by land, the dæmon by water. Do you?’ ‘Yes, I do.’ ‘And your dæmon?’ ‘The witches of the Arctic have the power of separation. At the moment, my dæmon is attending to an important piece of business somewhere else.’ He nodded, and set a calming hand on the head of his cheetah-dæmon. ‘And what do you need to know about the journey between here and Karamakan?’ ‘How long does it take for a camel-train to go that far?’ ‘Six months, more or less.’ ‘And a traveller alone?’ ‘Less time, but more danger.’ ‘Danger from what, Mustafa Bey?’ ‘Bandits on the ground. And even more from birds in the air. There are no zeppelin routes across these lands for that reason. The birds are immense and ferocious. They command the air almost entirely. Do your people ever fly across Central Asia?’ ‘Very seldom.’ ‘With good reason. But, Queen Tatiana, you are not telling me the truth.’ Lyra was aware of a deep soft growl, almost too quiet to hear. It was the merchant’s dæmon, whose black-rimmed eyes were staring at her throat. ‘In what way?’ said Lyra. Her skin was prickling. ‘You are not a witch. I have dealt with many witches – please do not interrupt me – and you are not one.’ ‘Could you tell at once?’ ‘No. I had to listen to you first. Now I am certain. Your name is Lyra Silvertongue.’ The Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume Three will be published in hardback, trade paperback, ebook and audiobook – narrated by Michael Sheen – on 23 October by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House in the UK, featuring illustrations from Chris Wormell.

44998d56f0af,Black Phone 2 review – hit horror sequel lumbers toward Elm Street,,"A rriving as the re-activated Stephen King machine was still churning out adaptations, quality be damned, The Black Phone felt like a lazy fanboy tribute. With its 1970s small-town setting, high school cast, psychic kids and gnarly neighbourhood villain, it was close to pastiche and, like the very worst of King’s stories, it was also inelegantly overstuffed. Funnily enough the call came from inside the family home, as it was based on a short story from King’s son Joe Hill, over-extended into a film that was a surprise $161m hit. It was the story of the Grabber, a sadistic killer of young boys who would revel in elongating the ritual of their deaths. While sexual abuse was never mentioned, there was something inescapably queer-coded about the character and the historical touchpoints/moral panics he was clearly supposed to refer to, reinforced by Ethan Hawke playing him with a certain swishy, effeminate flare (even before his appearance, the word fag had also been liberally used). But the film was too opaque to ever really admit that and even without that uneasiness, it was too busily plotted and too high on its exhaustingly grubby nastiness to work as anything more than an undiscerning sleepover nightmare fuel. Its sequel arrives as former horror hit-makers Blumhouse are in desperate need of a win. This year they have struggled to make anything work, from Wolf Man to The Woman in the Yard to Drop to the total box office disaster of M3gan 2.0, and so a great deal rides on whether Black Phone 2 can prove whether a short story can become a movie that can spawn a franchise. There’s just one slight problem … The first film ended with our Final Boy Finn (Mason Thames) killing the Grabber, assisted and trained by the ghosts of those he had killed before ( and his psychic sister helping to track down his location – see, busy!). It’s forced writer-director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer C Robert Cargill to take the series and its killer to a new place, turning a flesh and blood villain into a supernatural one, a route that takes them via Elm Street with an ability to cross back into the real world facilitated by dreams. But unlike Freddy Krueger, the Grabber is markedly uninventive and entirely devoid of humour (this time Hawke also plays him without any of the same camp-ness, perhaps reading the room a little …). The mask remains effectively jarring but the film struggles to make him as frightening as he briefly was in the first, trapped by convoluted and often confusing rules. Finn and his annoyingly foul-mouthed sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) encounter him again while snowed in at an alpine Christian camp for kids, the sequel also nodding toward Freddy’s one-time nemesis Jason Voorhees (both would make mincemeat of the Grabber). Gwen is guided there by a vision of her late mother and what might be their late tormenter’s first victims while Finn, still trying to process his anger and newfound ability to fight back, is following so he can protect her. The script is too ungainly in its contrived scene-setting, clumsily needing to get the siblings stranded at a place that will also add to backstories for both protagonist and antagonist, filling in details we didn’t really need or want to know about (as a mystery, it’s not all that interesting). In what also feels like a more calculated move to edge the film toward the same church-attending crowds that turned the Conjuring franchise into massive hits, Derrickson adds a religious element, with good now more closely associated with God and heaven while bad represents the devil and hell, faith the ultimate weapon against a monster like this. What all of this does is further over-stack a series that was already close to toppling over, adding unnecessary complications to what should be a simple Friday night engine (I often found myself too busy asking questions about the the hows and whys of what could or couldn’t happen to feel all that involved). It’s a low-lift effort for Hawke, whose face we never really see (it could, for all we know as viewers, be purely voice work) but he does have genuine presence that’s mostly missing elsewhere in the cast. The setting is at times atmospherically grand but the majority of the consistently un-scary set pieces are marred by a grainy 8mm texture to differentiate asleep and awake, an ineffective stylistic choice that feels too self-aware and constructed to mirror the horrifying unpredictability of being in an actual nightmare. At just under two hours, Black Phone 2, like M3gan 2.0 before it, is a needlessly long and hugely unconvincing argument for the birth of a new franchise. The next time it rings, I recommend not answering.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/black-phone-2-review-horror-sequel-ethan-hawke,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f86e15368cdaaf810e27571880155fbf93a71b28/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1a41b4b3c9a314260aefa108b25a8c5a",2025-10-16T09:01:01+00:00,53345bd01f9b01aedc7e5fccd025c197be2264fc
407aedb136a4,‘Chuck was breaking beer bottles over his own head’: thrash metal legends Testament on 40 years of mayhem,,"I n the Bay Area of mid-1980s California, a heavy metal scene was forming that was angrier, louder and much, much faster than anything that came before: thrash. Progenitors Metallica are the most well-known of its alumni, but this corner of the West Coast spawned dozens of other brilliant bands seemingly unbounded by tempo, or sometimes even melody. With their blistering, high-octane riffing and superb technical chops, one of the most formidable and resilient is Testament. Despite having enough lineup changes to rival the Fall, cancer scares and the 1990s grunge takeover that edged out cut-off denim for plaid shirts, Testament are still selling out tours, gnashing at the heels of the commercially dominating Big Four metal bands – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax – and releasing new records with just as much vigour. The most recent, Para Bellum, came out last week. It all started in late 1983 when, fresh from high school, Eric Peterson and cousin Derrick Ramirez from Alameda near Oakland, formed Testament’s precursor, Legacy. The two guitarists played their first show above a record store with local punks Rebels and Infidels, but their next – while clad in priest collars – was supporting Slayer. “That was our first taste of a sold-out crowd,” says Peterson, as the band dial in from their homes across the US. “We were so nervous. We only had four songs.” Ramirez soon quit, so Peterson recruited local Berkeley teenager Alex Skolnick – one of the most accomplished guitarists in metal, who studied under the virtuoso Joe Satriani. “I was into Ozzy and Dio,” says Skolnick. “Eric told me: we have to speed it up!” Completing the lineup was Louie Clemente on drums, bassist Greg Christian and Steve “Zetro” Souza on vocals. They’d go drinking together at the epicentre of the Bay Area thrash underground, Ruthie’s Inn; Peterson and Skolnick would “have a couple kamikazes [cocktails], plough our way through the crowd and just pummel people,” says Peterson of the pair’s boisterous moshpit demeanour. “They wouldn’t know what happened – that was kind of the vibe.” Souza quit to join fellow thrashers Exodus, leaving a gap for a frontman. The band knew a kid called Chuck Billy, known to Peterson and Clemente as The Cheese for his ever-present grin, who they’d occasionally spot hovering by beer kegs at parties. “He was very quiet but had a kind of sinister laugh,” says Peterson. The problem was that Billy fronted a hard-rocking glam band called Guilt: the kind of music that thrash metal fans poured scorn on, and sometimes worse. “You had to fit in: if you came from a glam band, and you went in [Ruthie’s Inn] – especially at Exodus shows – I think you got beaten up,” Peterson says. But when Billy decided to audition for Testament, Peterson and Clemente checked out a Guilt gig in San Francisco. “The guys had their Paul Stanley hair, doing their cute moves,” says Peterson. “Then Chuck came out wearing a trench coat and started breaking beer bottles over his head. He looked glam, but he had this presence.” ‘Forget trying to float a melody’ … Testament in 1988. Photograph: Gene Ambo Billy got the job, and thus began his glam deprogramming. Out with the spandex – a decision Billy says he was “happy for, believe me, being a big guy” – and in with Reebok hi-tops. Eric coached Billy into learning how to snarl along with the frenetic, bouncing-ball pace of thrash. “Forget trying to float a melody,” says Billy. “You have to keep up the pace.” By 1986, thrash metal was peaking. It was the year of Slayer’s furious 29-minute stormer Reign in Blood, Metallica’s Master of Puppets and Megadeth’s Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying? Somehow, the riffs got faster yet more complex, technical mastery mixed in with the breakneck speed. And it was the year Testament auditioned for Megaforce, the influential label that released Metallica’s first records. But the night that label owners Jon and Marsha were in town, Metallica’s wildly inventive bassist Cliff Burton, then only 24, was killed in a tour bus crash. “Our audition the next day was very sombre,” says Billy. “Here we were about to have the biggest performance of our lives in this unusual situation.” But Megaforce signed, the band changed their name to Testament and, in 1987, released debut album The Legacy to acclaim. Crammed into a van, the band toured extensively, supporting all the thrash mainstays – except Metallica, with Billy wondering if this is because Peterson married their guitarist Kirk Hammett’s ex – then climbing to top billing themselves. But with constant touring and the pressures of recording a new album each year, this hectic schedule eventually frayed relations. “Five records in a row, this pressure-cooker environment,” says Skolnick. “We were very young. I was a teen on that first record. After back-to-back recording and touring, we needed some rest and a long break, which we never had.” By now it was 1992 and grunge had swept in, hitting pause on thrash metal’s mainstream moment. Newly on Atlantic, Testament were under pressure to release something radio-friendly, which resulted in their next record The Ritual. Now a fan favourite, it was such a departure at the time that Testament refused to play its songs live. The frazzled Skolnick left to pursue jazz, later enrolling at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music (his other combo, the Alex Skolnick Trio, has a new record out too). “Louie and Greg were horrified,” Peterson says. “Me and Chuck were like, ‘OK’. The first thing I thought was: we can get heavy [again].” But a “scuff” led to Clemente quitting while on the road, leaving Testament without a drummer at a sold-out final show on Skolnick’s farewell tour. “We were inviting people from the crowd,” says Peterson. “Chuck was like: does anybody know this song? People are jumping up and giving it a go. It was a weird night, man.” Chuck Billy performing in 2015. Photograph: Mark Horton/Getty Images Testament continued in one form or another, recruiting other acclaimed and storied musicians such as Slayer’s Dave Lombardo; they down-tuned their instruments and got even heavier, with Billy perfecting his death-metal growl on 1999’s The Gathering. But in 2001, Billy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, with a large tumour lodged in his chest. While undergoing treatment, Billy – who was raised Catholic but whose father was Native American Pomo – reconnected with his Indigenous roots. Along with chemotherapy, he contacted Native healers and medicine men with whom he shared mysterious spiritual experiences involving wolf dens, chanting, eagle feathers and astral travel, and who he credits with helping him to fully recover. A 2005 tour with the classic lineup reunited the band, where one gig “turned into five, five turned into 10,” says Billy. But they played only occasionally and remained “off in these other worlds,” adds Skolnick, who was then a full-time session player. Billy worked in transport – giving safety lectures, presumably not about smashing bottles over one’s head – while Peterson focused on his symphonic black metal band, Dragonlord, until a major 2008 tour offer with Motörhead, Heaven & Hell and Judas Priest was offered on the condition they record a new album. No sign of slowing down … Testament in 2025. Photograph: Fred Kowalo So they did – and never stopped. A couple of decades later, Testament show no signs of slowing down, save for the occasional ballad; with new drummer Chris Dovas in tow, their latest album, Para Bellum introduces elements like icy, black metal-style tremolo riffing , with themes covering the CIA agent-mangling Havana syndrome and, naturally, AI. “Destruction’s coming by the terabyte,” growls Billy on single, Infanticide AI, “the future’s destined to replace the soul” – though Skolnick believes metal music is safe from these techno-dystopian torments. “There’s no way it’s going to sound like guys getting in a room hashing out a tune and radiating as humans,” he says. And through all their winding sonic travels, lineup changes, trials and tribulations, the sounds of each of the band’s eras radiate something distinctly human. “They’re all just different modes of us, you know?” says Peterson.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/16/thrash-metal-legends-testament-on-40-years-of-mayhem,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08c91a416e858b55bdc2c346cf6cf0f7c2af542/91_634_3558_2846/master/3558.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=52346bab7afcf9b46517dfb49cc8d1b3",2025-10-16T09:00:03+00:00,84356880abd8c486b331633c0f4ec298a380ebde
eb27beec9301,Fatboy Slim: ‘We converted the indie kids into rave monkeys – and it felt good’,,"M ost artists struggle with the “difficult” second album. Not wanting to sound big-headed, but this was not the case for me. The early success, especially of tunes such as Going Out of My Head and Everybody Needs a 303, had crystalised in my mind where all of this was going. I knew what was turning people on and had kinda cracked the formula of how the next album should sound. The formula was: breakbeats from my love of hip-hop, the anarchic rebellion of punk, the energy of acid house and hooks from the pop music I grew up on. I had all the thrift store samples built into a library for audio collage, and a club to test out new tunes. This new movement in music so far had no name to pigeonhole it. We, and journalists, tried various options such as tripno, Brit hop, and amyl house, but the name that it landed with came from my club – the Big Beat Boutique. We felt an enormous collective pride in that. House music was named after the Warehouse Club in Chicago, garage music was named after the Paradise Garage in New York, and now big beat was named after our night at a little scout hut in Brighton. Our style of music was crossing over to the mainstream, which tickled me no end. Someone wrote: “Fatboy makes dance music for people who don’t like dance music.” I took it as a huge compliment. The Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada were converting the rock and indie kids into rave monkeys, and it felt good. The dancefloor was for all. The recording of my second album, You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby, was quick and almost effortless. In one week alone I wrote Praise You, Right Here, Right Now and Fucking in Heaven. The album was released in October 1998, and thankfully was met with excellent reviews and outrageous sales. We knew it was good, and that there was momentum and excitement in the air, but we had no concept of how far it was going: a decade after appearing in the Housemartins, I was about to be a pop star again! With success comes celebrity, not something I had experienced before to this extent, and not something that sat well with me. But with a tumbler of vodka in my hand I ploughed my way through. A knock-on effect of the rise in popularity was that gigs were starting to get bigger. As well as nightclubs, I was now playing bigger venues and being invited to play some of the festivals. A lot of those gigs had not been done by DJs before, only bands and singers. Large stages looked a bit sparse with one bloke, a table and a couple of record players where normally a band’s expansive backline would be. I had to follow Foo Fighters at T in the Park one time, and they had put on a balls-out rock’n’roll show, which had the crowd super hyped. When all their equipment was rolled off, the 30ft walk to my table seemed an awfully long way. Before starting on it, Garry [Blackburn, manager] had asked: “How are you gonna follow that?” Somewhere along that walk I morphed into Captain Showboat, a kind of cross between Mick Jagger and Liberace. The crowd lapped it up, and my stage persona was born. It Ain’t Over… ’Til the Fatboy Sings by Norman Cook, published by Rocket 88, is out now . Right here, right now: images from It Ain’t Over… ’Til the Fatboy Sings Brighton beach shows (main image) In 2002, over 250,000 people descended on Brighton for the second Big Beach Boutique, a free Fatboy Slim show that shut down the city. Cook ended up paying £30,000 towards an emergency beach clean team, noting the “whole seafront stank of piss for weeks”.

A Life in Lyrics will feature abandoned verses for Bohemian Rhapsody and drafts of Don’t Stop Me Now. The material, taken from Mercury’s personal notebooks, has been released by Mary Austin, the singer’s former fiancee and closest friend. Mercury died in 1991, leaving his house and possessions to Austin, along with his entire creative archive spanning the early days of Queen to the end of his solo career. Austin said: “In early 2023, in the midst of cataloguing the contents of Garden Lodge, this wonderful home Freddie had left to me, I began to leaf through the papers my family and I had collected together from where they had lain, undisturbed and unseen, in the house for over 30 years.” She found working drafts of Mercury’s lyrics on loose sheets of paper and in plain notebooks that “entirely belied the wonders within”. You’re my best friend: Freddie Mercury and Mary Austin. Photograph: Courtesy of the private collection of Mary Austin/PA Austin believes Mercury’s handwritten notes offer “a window into his brilliant, creative mind” and , for her, “stirred up many memories from decades past, of conversations, occasions and emotions”. “I hope that by sharing his manuscripts now, contextualised with fresh insights and a sprinkling of vignettes of our lives together, I will illuminate the remarkable creative force of my dear friend for the enjoyment of everyone he continues to delight and inspire, even after all these years,” she added. Mercury and Austin met in 1969 and he proposed to her on Christmas Day, 1973. They broke off their engagement three years later and remained lifelong friends. The singer had relationships with men and women and described himself as bisexual. Mercury was diagnosed with Aids in 1987 and died of bronchial pneumonia, aged 45, in 1991 . Austin inherited about half of his estimated £9m estate. A Life in Lyrics, which will be illustrated with images from Mercury’s personal archive, is scheduled for release by HarperCollins on 1 September next year, a few days before the singer would have celebrated his 80th birthday. Last month, another book about Mercury claimed to shed light on an unknown chapter in his life. Love, Freddie by Lesley-Ann Jones alleges that the singer had a secret daughter, unknown to even his closest friends. The book has divided fans and the people who were closest to Mercury. skip past newsletter promotion Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He adored me and was devoted to me.” Little is known about B, other than her age and the fact she is a medical professional working in Europe. She claimed Mercury entrusted her with 17 journals that cover the final years of his life, which Jones said are “the closest thing to a Freddie Mercury autobiography that the world will ever know”. Austin, however, said she did not know about a secret child. “The truth is that I am simply not the guardian of such a secret,” she said. “I’ve never known of any child, or of any diaries.

There was nobody like her. Bright, talented, generous, and very smart and witty. She had more than just a sense of humour; she was hysterical. Whatever it was, she just had it. The first time I saw her was in a deodorant commercial where she bit somebody’s ear . Everything about her was original. I’d be interested in anything she was involved in because she was so keen and so smart and so witty. And anybody who got to work with her was in for a treat – as I later found. We first met when she came in to audition for a picture that I was preparing called A Glimpse of Tiger . She didn’t get the part, and I wound up not doing the picture, but I remember even back then how unique she seemed, as well as very down to earth and extremely normal. Diane Keaton and Elliott Gould in The Lemon Sisters. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images I then did three pictures with her – I Will, I Will … For Now; Harry and Walter Go to New York and The Lemon Sisters – and we became friends.

Photograph: Brut Productions/Allstar She was beautiful, she was sexy, and she was nice! What more can you ask for? She became a legitimate superstar class American artist, yet she stayed exactly the same person regardless of her fame. She was such a complete professional. Even when the pictures didn’t all quite work, she always worked. I’d always remember when we were making our first picture together, in a little town called Ojai in California. After dinner, we snuck away into the bush together and she said to me: “This is called making out.” She was brilliantly talented and funny, but she was also plain-speaking and really nice.

They directed anyone wanting to make donations in her honour towards causes she believed in: “She loved her animals and she was steadfast in her support of the unhoused community, so any donations in her memory to a local food bank or an animal shelter would be a wonderful and much appreciated tribute to her.” Diane Keaton: the beloved Hollywood actor with a gift for comedy – video obituary Keaton died in California at the age of 79 . An enduring and singular icon of cinema since her Oscar-winning turn in 1977’s Annie Hall – which her director, writer, co-star and former boyfriend Woody Allen based heavily on her own life – Keaton starred in some of the key movies of the last half century, including The Godfather and its sequels, Reds, Marvin’s Room, Something’s Gotta Give, Father of the Bride and The First Wives Club. Her death came as a shock across Hollywood and the rest of the world; though she had not been in the public eye for some months, no illness had been announced. After her death, People quoted a source close to the actor saying that Keaton’s health had “declined very suddenly” over recent months and that even many of her longtime friends “weren’t fully aware of what was happening”. Many of her former co-stars , including Woody Allen, Jane Fonda, Keanu Reeves, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep, paid tribute to her. Keaton never married. She is survived by her two younger sisters, Dorrie and Robin, and her two children, daughter Dexter and son Duke, whom she adopted in 1996 and 2001. “Motherhood has completely changed me,” she once said. “It’s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I’ve ever had.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/diane-keaton-cause-death,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f79103441390060be94ed1306a889327287c4e5/306_0_2785_2228/master/2785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5151df36744cc5746ff18315be015a35",2025-10-16T04:34:44+00:00,096a7780bf173d9c5b6377259c4c2bd4b4c9d95a
42f6cdaf3d88,The Diplomat season three review – Keri Russell’s nail-biting political thriller is a ludicrous treat,,"O ver two high-stakes seasons, this drama about a US ambassador to the UK who finds herself moonlighting for the president and the entire state department has proved itself to be a rare beast: a political thriller that is frequently excellent, often erudite (a character once referred to another as “the Hecate of Highgate” instead of just calling her a stirrer), but which also requires the total and utter suspension of your disbelief. Question any of it for a second – as I did in the final episode of this third series, when the new US president asks the prime minister whether Chequers is his family’s ancestral seat – and it begins to crumble. But if you file it firmly within the category of spicy geopolitical soap? Boy oh boy, is it good. We pick up where season two left off, and the aftermath of a car bomb that badly injured Kate’s (Keri Russell) on/off husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell). Meanwhile, British PM Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) is still apoplectic about the actions of Tory fixer Margaret Roylin (Celia Imrie), who proved to be not only an irritant with a direct line to the Daily Mail, but the mastermind of a false-flag operation that implicated Russia. Of course, what our canny diplomat Kate knows is that Roylin was acting on behalf of someone even more influential: US vice-president Grace Penn (Allison Janney), whose job Kate was eyeing up last season. Everyone has more pressing concerns, however: when he found out the truth about Penn, President Rayburn carked it in the final moments of season two, leaving Penn to step up and creating a vacancy for VP. Surely Kate is a shoo-in as Penn’s deputy, especially with this much collateral on her? Celia Imrie as Margaret Roylin in The Diplomat. Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix Of course, with there being eight episodes to fill, Kate does not simply pack up her large collection of trouser suits and leg it to the White House to get down to some paperwork. Not least because Penn doesn’t choose her for VP – she picks noted manchild Hal instead. He takes the role but insists he’ll find something for Kate to do; rather than suggesting something in the vein of, say, Melania Trump’s Be Best anti-bullying campaign, he decides maybe she can lead on the reconstruction of Ukraine or maybe pull up a chair with Nato. What follows is an increasingly ludicrous tale, as Kate attempts to hang on to her ambassador role while also dropping into DC now and again for second lady duty. I suppose there isn’t really a show called The Diplomat if the lead character isn’t a diplomat any more, but it is so stressful watching her pinball between the two countries, standing up the director of the CIA because she’s forgotten to check Google Calendar. The whole thing is – as put-upon White House chief of staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah) puts it – “a cockamamie arrangement”, though you may prefer stronger terms. Kate does, at least, bag a boyfriend along the way, played by Poldark’s Aidan Turner, who says things like “in a day or so, [Hal’s] going to go back to Washington, and I’m going to take all your clothes off”. It isn’t the sexiest dialogue ever but saves on limited time, due to all of the above and a new military threat. ‘Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery’ … Photograph: Netflix There are, I’m glad to report, some excellent performances, not least from West Wing alums Janney and Bradley Whitford, who reconnect here with each other and with showrunner Debora Cahn. They are reunited as Penn and her husband, Todd, an “increasingly insignificant househusband married to a supernova” who stifles all of his frustration beneath a rictus grin, à la Succession’s Connor Roy. Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery, especially when she’s telling her lookalike decoy to buy a hairbrush. I struggle to care too much about the ongoing will they/won’t they dynamic between Kate’s right-hand man Stuart (Ato Essandoh) and CIA chief Eidra Park (Ali Ahn), but I am still glad to see them all there, like old friends (albeit the sort of friends who talk solely about political conspiracies and whether or not they should kiss). We also learn more about Kate and Hal’s marriage, and the ebb and flow of power between these two that helps to contextualise flippant lines from earlier in the series, like the time Kate absent-mindedly mentioned her other half had once been kidnapped by Hezbollah. The final two episodes see us hurtle towards a startlingly similar conclusion to last season, and there are moments where it begins to drag. But, on the whole, The Diplomat remains a treat. Keep that disbelief close, and it will feel more like a comedy in places. But keep it at bay, and – much like our own real-world politics – it is a nail-biter.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/16/the-diplomat-season-three-review-netflix-thriller-keri-russells,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3afb33e8f19d67b5ae02543758a926c1488708a/398_272_2661_2128/master/2661.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=530b5c6c9678a7cd50284a293afd33f2",2025-10-16T04:00:56+00:00,66373c6e57a0165a75020e7af8d5b75a70b72fcc
d310dc471e00,Ministers plan high-level visits to China despite espionage trial outcry,,"Ministers are pushing ahead with their reset of relations with China , including several planned high-level visits before the end of the year, despite the furore triggered by the collapse of a high-profile espionage trial. Plans have been drawn up for Jonathan Powell , the national security adviser, to travel to Beijing in November for talks before an anticipated trip by Keir Starmer next year. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Patrick Vallance, the science minister, are also expected to travel to China on government business before the end of the year. The government could yet decide to pull or postpone Powell’s November trip after he was dragged into the controversy surrounding the abandonment of charges against two men accused of spying for Beijing . A government spokesperson said: “We have long been clear that we are bringing a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing our relations with China, rooted in UK interests. That includes constructive and robust engagement at a variety of levels.” The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly pulled the charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, last month. The CPS argued that the government had not provided sufficient evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”. Starmer published the three witness statements submitted by a deputy national security adviser, Matthew Collins, to prosecutors on Wednesday after accusations he had interfered with the trial to protect the UK’s trading relationship with China. In a letter to the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday, the prime minister rejected Tory claims that Powell had a role in shaping the evidence that ultimately led the case to collapse. He wrote that while Powell attended a meeting about the case with senior Whitehall officials in September, “these discussions were based on the working assumption that the case would proceed – which was the desired outcome of the government – and focused on how to handle the implications”. The meeting, on 1 September, took place nearly a month after Collins submitted his final witness statement to the CPS on 4 August. Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP Powell last travelled to Beijing in mid-July where he met China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi. The Chinese government said they had discussed the UK government’s desire for “a consistent, lasting and mutually respectful relationship”. Phillipson is planning to travel to China later this year for talks on education, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Vallance’s trip next month, which was first reported by PoliticsHome , is to hold a formal, in-person forum on science, innovation and technology for the first time since 2018. Virtual talks were held in 2021. The visits are the latest examples of high-level engagement between the UK and China which has stepped up since Labour entered power. Rishi Sunak’s administration sought to pursue a similar approach but was hamstrung by political instability and opposition from hawkish Tory backbenchers. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Plans are being drawn up for Starmer to make a bilateral trip to China next year, possibly in mid-February. Donald Trump has also said he intends to make a trip to China early next year, which could affect the timing of Starmer’s visit if it goes ahead. The last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May in 2018 , when ministers were still talking about a “golden era” in relations with the country. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, travelled to China with a business delegation in January and unveiled £600m in investment. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, have also visited China for talks over the past year. Senior Chinese government figures made several visits to the UK in the same period. This week, Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary of the Foreign Office, became the latest senior government figure to travel to Beijing . Part of his brief has been to discuss much-needed refurbishment to Britain’s embassy in Beijing, which China is blocking while the fate of its own new embassy is being decided.

d65d7fbf20cf,Farage urged to explain anti-abortion links to meeting with Trump officials,,"Nigel Farage has been urged to explain why a US anti-abortion advocacy group helped arrange a meeting in London with Trump administration officials and diplomats. The meeting, first reported by the New York Times , took place in March between Farage and a delegation from Trump’s state department, which it said was overseen by the US embassy and brokered by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) group. The meeting was said to have discussed abortion rights, free speech and online safety laws. ADF, which supports free speech and religious freedom, has worked in Britain to help challenge the prosecutions of Christians who were arrested for praying silently outside abortion clinics, breaching “buffer zones”. The group, which is non-politically partisan and says it is a human rights charity, said it was not present at the meeting and had never met with Reform UK politicians to discuss abortion law. In response to the meeting, the Liberal Democrats accused Farage of working with Trump officials and anti-abortion campaigners who want to water down women’s rights and urged him to explain what was discussed. Daisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, also called on the government to summon the US ambassador to get to the bottom of “what looks like a blatant attempt to interfere in the UK’s domestic laws”. “Nigel Farage needs to come clean … and explain if his party would weaken women’s rights if he came to power,” she said. “The Liberal Democrats will stand up against these attempts to turn Trump’s America into Farage’s Britain and roll back the clock on decades of progress.” Reform was approached for comment. Asked by the New York Times about his relationship with the ADF, Farage said his party talks with “all sorts of groups” and denied speaking against abortion, telling a reporter that she was “talking utter bollocks”. He said that abortion was “No 468” on Reform UK’s agenda and noted he had “hardly ever spoken about it in 30 years”. “My point was that the 24-week limit was looking in serious jeopardy given that we actually spend a fortune saving babies at 22 weeks,” he said. “Maybe we need to rethink all of that because there is clearly a legal inconsistency.” The New York Times also reported that the ADF helped to arrange Farage’s three-hour testimony to US Congress earlier this year, where he described Britain as “awful” and criticised the Online Safety Act. An ADF International spokesman said: “The Liberal Democrats have made allegations here that are simply wrong. To be clear, ADF International has never met with any Reform UK politician to discuss abortion law. We never attended any breakfast meeting between US embassy staff and Nigel Farage. And it was the US House Judiciary Committee, not ADF International, that decided who should testify before Congress. “The reality is ADF International is a registered human rights charity in the UK and is non-politically partisan. We are committed to tackling the free speech crisis in this country and to protecting fundamental freedoms for all across the world.” A spokesman for the US embassy in London said officials regularly met those from different faiths and “elements of the political spectrum” in Britain and “anywhere else where freedom of expression is under threat.” In February, the US vice-president, JD Vance, told the Munich Security Conference that UK prosecutions of those defying abortion buffer zones showed a “backslide away from conscience rights” and a “retreat” from free speech. He highlighted the case of Adam Smith-Connor who was convicted last October of breaching a designated “safe zone” outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/farage-urged-to-explain-anti-abortion-links-to-meeting-with-trump-officials,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8c81edbcb2539a14e4cd3f7e7a69fb43a939356/141_0_4840_3872/master/4840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afdcb2036cbeddacd0e6d92cade71f97",2025-10-16T15:57:42+00:00,4dd4472eec91ea98f0ffcf1861d7a2999b1fdd81
ae3123017e64,Labour begins charm offensive to win over MPs sceptical of digital ID plans,,"Ministers have launched a charm offensive to win over sceptical Labour MPs to back the digital ID scheme, asking MPs to offer ideas about how it could improve public services. The outreach is part of a broader loyalty and delivery drive to soothe tensions after a fractious few months for the government. Several cabinet ministers have said the government needs to make the case for a wider digital identity system. The aim is for the ID cards to be rolled out before the next election and initially used to prove people’s right to work, before being expanded to store health and benefits data to streamline access to public services and tackle fraud. Ministers have told MPs there is a firm commitment to build the digital ID within the public sector and not contract it out to private companies. MPs who met ministers and officials on Tuesday were told it would be a federated system – akin to one built for the NHS – which means that data is distributed across multiple independent but connecting systems. It would make it harder in theory to hack the entire dataset because there is no single point of failure, though it would not be immune. About 50 MPs attended the session with the technology minister Ian Murray and Cabinet office minister Josh Simons. “The main thing everyone in the room wanted to know was the cost,” one MP said. “And no one can even give us a ballpark.” Some close to the process said ministers were aware of the political risk of the scheme, estimating that about 50 MPs could rebel if a vote were held now, and that the number could double once details are ironed out. “They’re being cautious and want to get it right this time,” an MP said. MPs who had read the original Labour Together proposal for a BritCard – which has formed the basis of the government’s policy – said the cost calculations in that were “laughably low” at £150m. But several said they were pleased to see the degree of MP engagement. “Look, everyone felt this was sprung on us,” one MP said. “And it did feel like this would be welfare all over again but in fact they are engaging us quite a lot. And MPs do have a lot of expertise from surgeries about systemic problems whether that’s immigration or benefits. So I am cautiously optimistic.” Key backers in the room for the scheme included a number of the “red wall” MPs. . Emily Darlington, the Milton Keynes Central MP, is also said to have been doing significant outreach to MPs. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One MP retorted: “My data been hacked in the DWP several times.” One MP opposed to the changes said: “The obvious idea is to paint those against it as luddites .” Ministers said they hoped the digital ID scheme would allow quicker identification of gang leaders or bosses employing illegal workers, citing nail bars and car washes as examples. But MPs in the room suggested it would be most helpful if used for the benefits system – such as preventing the Department for Work and Pensions from making overpayments which cause a huge amount of stress for claimants who have the money taken back. Murray is said to have ruled out digital IDs being used to hold data from the NHS and said police would not be allowed to demand to see them. A government source said the intention was for MPs to offer ideas for the system and to inform the consultation, the story that the government could tell and how to “bust the myths” about digital ID, which is facing intense opposition from across the political spectrum. The charm offensive is understood to include two or three themed round tables a week – covering digital ID and also special education needs and disabilities reform – another flashpoint in the coming year. “It’s about rebuilding trust and making sure people feel heard,” one said. “They obviously don’t want another welfare rebellion style surprise.” No 10’s new political director, Amy Richards, has also been tasked with reaching out to groups of MPs and those outside Westminster to help shape the consultation, including to those who might instinctively oppose the scheme. They include Black, Asian and minority ethnic MPs, those with rural constituencies, select committee chairs, Scottish MPs and groups campaigning on digital inclusion and public service reform.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/ministers-begin-charm-offensive-to-win-over-labour-mps-sceptical-of-digital-id-plans,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06d92341c681c5c3b23c3fa38a82cb200c4dfdc9/153_0_1930_1545/master/1930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=127d400d2b13424820cec9630526b4d5",2025-10-16T14:14:18+00:00,edc84d8fef4a102d6876b15673396f861b76388d
a42b7a64aa37,China spy case row shows why most MPs prefer conspiracy theory over cock-up,,"I t’s all as clear as mud. If Keir Starmer thought that releasing the three witness statements of the deputy national security adviser (DNSA) Matthew Collins late on Wednesday night was going to make the China spy case row go away, then he was in for a big disappointment. There was no way MPs were going to let a story like this out of their clutches. This was their moment to take centre stage. When they could bathe in their own importance. When they could believe that they and national security were one and the same thing. There again, whatever Starmer had put into the public domain would never have been enough. Even a letter from the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, falling on his sword and admitting he had taken his eye off the ball, would have been dismissed as irrelevant. When it comes to a choice between cock-up and conspiracy, most MPs naturally gravitate to conspiracy. So much more exciting. Life’s too dull when it’s just some unelected apparatchik doing a job badly. As the facts change, MPs merely change their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence. In her embarrassing tirades at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, Kemi Badenoch had insisted that Starmer was at the centre of a major cover-up. That he had personally leant on Collins to get him to change his evidence. That he was basically a Chinese spy himself, doing the bidding of his masters in Beijing. Punching the air in triumph as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) collapsed the trial. Come Thursday morning, that particular narrative appeared dead in the water. There was just no evidence to support it. But not to worry. Because another conspiracy theory was at hand. One that was the polar opposite of the previous one. In this exciting new version, it was Starmer’s lack of involvement, his failure to nobble Collins that was compelling proof the prime minister was a Chinese stooge. A true red, white and blue patriot would have done whatever it took to secure a conviction. Stopped at nothing. Putting a gun to Collins’s and Parkinson’s heads. Doing nothing was simply unforgivable. As one door closed for opposition MPs, another one opened. Not that there was any recognition that the terms of reference for the conspiracy theory had just done a U-turn. On days like these politicians imagine themselves to be a tabula rasa. Yesterday doesn’t matter. It never happened. All that matters is what happens today. So it was almost inevitable there would be an urgent question in the Commons to give MPs a platform to air their new theories that had been developed overnight. You can generally gauge how much trouble the government reckons it is in by the minister it sends out to answer a UQ. Get a cabinet minister and the government is supremely confident of its position. So the appearance of Chris Ward, the most junior of ministers in the Cabinet Office making his first ever outing at the dispatch box, on the government frontbench, told you all you needed to know. And, to be fair, Ward did about as well as could be expected under the circumstances. He didn’t die on his arse and only had to endure a modicum of faux pity from opposition MPs. It’s just that he would much rather have been anywhere than in the Commons at 10.30 on a Thursday morning. It wasn’t so much that he had nothing much to say – which he didn’t really – it was more that he knew nothing he did have to say was going to make much difference. Try telling a UFO convention that UFOs don’t exist will only make the audience even more convinced they do. Because the establishment would say that, wouldn’t they? Poor Chris. All he could do was stand up and read the words in front of him. The DNSA had made the witness statements without any interference from government. He wasn’t entirely sure why Collins had added a line from the Labour manifesto about China being an economic opportunity. Presumably to give context that Labour’s line on China was not that much different to the Tories. And you’d have to ask the DPP why the CPS had dropped the case. Then the onslaught, First from shadow minister for policy renewal, Neil O’Brien. The CPS had said they were just 5% short on the evidence they needed to get take the case to trial. Why hadn’t the government done whatever it took to get the case over the line? To a layperson, this sounded very much like expecting the government to fabricate new evidence if the existing material was insufficient. But maybe spy trials don’t count. There again, surely the Met could have knocked something up. They are old hands at that sort of thing. Labour MPs were equally bewildered. Emily Thornberry couldn’t work out why the CPS had not just backed off and let a jury decide on the guilt. Matt Western, chair of joint committee of national security strategies, announced he would be starting an inquiry of his own. Barry Gardiner raised doubts about the quality of information the spies had provided. Careful Bazza. Careless talk cost lives. Just because the spies passed on information freely available elsewhere and gossip picked up in the coffee queue in Portcullis House, this didn’t mean it was any less serious. This was MPs we were talking about. Nothing is more important than that. Tory Tom Tugendhat, one of the two MPs targeted, begged the prime minister to come to his rescue. How could he have abandoned Tom by not leaning more heavily on Collins? This wasn’t party politics, it was a matter of life and death. Just provide the evidence, damn it! If you haven’t got it, then invent it. It wasn’t hard. What was the point of being prime minister if you didn’t bang up spies? The Tories kept on coming. Bernard Jenkin refused to believe Collins wasn’t nobbled in some way. Bernie couldn’t explain whether he had been nobbled to keep quiet or write rubbish witness statements. Jeremy Wright and Nick Timothy wanted the spies banged up regardless of whether they were guilty or not. Miraculously, none of the Conservatives engaged with the fact that it had been their own government’s stance on China that had collapsed the case. Or that the case would have still collapsed if they had been in power. Ward just stood there and took it all. It was all a big cock-up. Look to the CPS for answers. The government was equally gutted the case had not gone ahead. Come the end, there were points of order from Alicia Kearns, another spyee, Tugendhat and Graham Stuart. Stuart asked for an expression of sympathy to be shown towards Ward. Chris looked crushed. Ridicule he could take. Pity was too much.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/china-spy-case-row-shows-why-most-mps-prefer-conspiracy-theory-over-cock-up,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aafddba6dcd8e789dd15dc96c3beee6afdd963f/338_0_1349_1080/master/1349.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=39d66858c9e9ebf85ac9e32a582703a7",2025-10-16T14:48:05+00:00,3f4eb8ea5471b2c37da1d2c8aeb7d963bc7b22b0
96b3b28a9315,China spying case: dream job turns into nightmare for DPP Stephen Parkinson,,"Stephen Parkinson dreamed of being the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales before he even qualified as a barrister, but now finds himself in a situation more akin to a nightmare. As the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Parkinson is facing questions over why he felt he could not proceed with the trial of two men accused of spying for China. He said the case was dropped because prosecutors had tried and failed to obtain a witness statement from the government stating that China posed a current “threat to the national security of the UK”. But that explanation has been called into question by some senior lawyers and, perhaps more ominously for Parkinson’s job prospects, by politicians too. A government minister, Stephen Kinnock, declined to say whether Parkinson was the right person for the job of DPP. A former colleague described him as independent minded, unafraid to take difficult decisions and someone who would follow his principles and would have thought it through before issuing the statement about the China case. In an interview with Counsel magazine , Parkinson described himself as a “late developer” at his Wiltshire comprehensive school, who had not applied to university initially because he had poor predicted grades for his A-levels. He took a year out after better than expected results during which he applied to study law at university – an idea put in his mind by his younger brother who was planning to do the same – and he worked as a dustman, on a kibbutz and as a travelling ballpoint pen salesman in South Africa. Parkinson joined a criminal barrister’s chambers after studying law at UCL. “Already during pupillage, I had decided that I wanted to work for the DPP’s office [the forerunner of the CPS], indeed that one day I’d like to be DPP,” he told Counsel. “In those days, a typical announcement following a serious crime was that ‘the papers have been sent to the DPP’. I thought, ‘I want to be that person’.” In the 40-plus years before he became “that person” he clearly kept his eye on the post, and on those in the seat he coveted. Given his current travails, Parkinson will be hoping that Keir Starmer does not hold grudges as, according to the Telegraph , he was critical of the prime minister’s record as head of the CPS, suggesting he was over-reliant on the advice of others. Parkinson is said to have described the Labour leader as “an average DPP”, adding: “He had no in-depth experience of prosecuting … he was a defence and human rights lawyer.” Additionally, when Starmer stepped down as DPP in 2013, Parkinson was scathing of the fact that the office had, since 1987, always been held by barristers from private practice. “None had any experience of working within the public sector, none have had any serious experience of management,” said Parkinson . “The last two directors have had no significant prosecution background at all before their appointment. Yet the core of CPS work is decision-making on which cases to prosecute, and subsequent pre-trial preparation.” It has been suggested that Parkinson’s criticism of Starmer helped him land the job under the Tories. However, he held several roles in government in Tony Blair’s administration, including deputy head of the attorney general’s office from 1999 to 2003. At the end of his time there, he acted for Blair in the Hutton inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly. It was the same year that protesters – one of whom who would be represented by Starmer – sabotaged US bombers at RAF Fairford before they were due to fly to Iraq. Parkinson continued his work for Blair on the Hutton inquiry when he joined city law firm Kingsley Napley, where he also defended Rebekah Brooks against phone-hacking charges . Given the charges were brought under Starmer’s oversight , that may have contributed to the “average DPP” comment. At Kingsley Napley, Parkinson re-qualified as a solicitor – he is reportedly the first solicitor to become DPP since the 1960s – became head of criminal practice at the firm and then senior partner. He told Counsel magazine that the DPP job came up three times when he was at Kingsley Napley and he was approached each time but it was never the right moment. When he retired as senior partner in 2023 he “was looking forward to dog walking and running” but when approached again “reminded myself how much I had always wanted to do the job”. Two years into his five-year term, dog walking and running may suddenly seem more appealing.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/china-spying-case-dream-job-turns-into-nightmare-for-dpp-stephen-parkinson,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b5115ff3dcbd2ea5f9a91d70b0b53658e27708/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8cd02fe5af3c58c2ad8c316c1a0d4ed",2025-10-16T16:14:50+00:00,c20c3475ce174cd147a13a1f51a24d72adacac73
3bbca7eca904,Four dead as Kenyan security forces fire on crowds mourning Raila Odinga,,"Four people have been killed in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, after security forces fired shots and teargas to disperse huge crowds at a stadium where the body of opposition leader Raila Odinga was lying in state. Odinga, a major figure in Kenyan politics for decades who was once a political prisoner and ran unsuccessfully for president five times, died on Wednesday aged 80 in India , where he had been receiving medical treatment. With thousands of his supporters on the streets from early morning, chaos erupted when a huge crowd breached a gate at Nairobi’s main stadium, prompting soldiers to fire in the air, a Reuters witness said. A police source told Reuters that two people were shot dead at the stadium. KTN News and Citizen TV later said the death toll had increased to four, with scores injured. After security forces fired shots, police used teargas to disperse thousands of mourners, the two broadcasters reported, leaving the stadium deserted. Earlier in the day, thousands of mourners briefly stormed Nairobi’s international airport, interrupting a ceremony for president William Ruto and other officials to receive Odinga’s body with military honours. The incident prompted a two-hour suspension of airport operations. Crowds also flooded nearby roads and tried to breach parliament, where the government had originally scheduled the public viewing. Though mainly known as an opposition figure, Odinga became prime minister in 2008 and also struck a political pact with Ruto last year in a career marked by shifting alliances.

Many of Odinga’s mourners, who were not yet born in 1991 when Kenya became a multi-party democracy, paid tribute to Odinga’s efforts as an activist. Felix Ambani Uneck, a university student, said at the stadium: “He fought tirelessly for multi-party democracy, and we are enjoying those freedoms today because of his struggle.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/kenya-security-fire-on-crowds-mourning-raila-odinga,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7df4bd2af1dff9697f795a611635dc9ad97dc6e/132_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c15217396dbb60335113ce12c8bce776",2025-10-16T17:24:59+00:00,629e8bee8b817f9ab543ec6c8d9ca2d973d8d95c
30dbda97d2d6,"Brazil to ask countries to quadruple biofuel use, leak suggests",,"Brazil will ask countries to quadruple the global use of controversial biofuels despite concerns from environmental experts, the Guardian has learned. A leaked document seen by the Guardian sets out a draft pledge for world leaders gathering at the climate conference next month in Brazil to increase the use of biofuels in the next decade by four times compared with 2024 levels. Brazil is the world’s second largest producer of ethanol, one of several types of biofuel. It argues in the document that biofuels – made from a wide variety of organic matter such as sugar cane in the case of ethanol – will displace fossil fuels, and that they represent a benefit to the climate and environment. But this is disputed by green experts and campaigners, who point out that biofuel production is resulting in increased deforestation in many regions , leading to the replacement of land that is rich in species with monocultures , and reducing the land available for food production. A study by the Transport and Environment thinktank , published this month, shows that at present “biofuels are responsible globally for 16% more CO 2 emissions than the fossil fuels they replace due to the indirect impacts of farming and deforestation”. The report found that by 2030, biofuels crops would require land the size of France, which would make it the sixth largest country in terms of arable land use globally; that a fifth of vegetable oil is used for cars rather than food; that 3,000 litres of water are needed to drive 100km on biofuels; and that solar panels could create as much energy as biofuels while using just 3% as much land. The draft pledge stipulates that the increase in biofuels such as ethanol should be from environmentally sustainable sources. Andreas Sieber, associate director of policy and campaigns at 350.org , said: “So-called ‘sustainable fuels’ must never deflect from the central task: transitioning away from fossil fuels and scaling-up renewables. While Brazil’s interest in biofuels may partly come from good intentions, presenting ‘sustainable fuels’ as an equal pillar to renewables is misguided. These fuels often exaggerate their climate benefits, worsen food insecurity, and drive biodiversity loss through monocultures of corn, soy and sugarcane. The transition away from fossil fuels must remain the overarching goal. “It’s particularly worrying to already see countries like Italy and Japan join this initiative and co-opt this narrative for industrial or political convenience. That’s not climate leadership, it’s a dangerous distraction.” Cian Delaney, biofuels campaigner at T&E, said: “This pledge involves doubling the world’s supply of biofuels. It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where this doesn’t require more land clearance. Without any commitment from countries to meet the target without clearing more land, this will be devastating for the climate, ecosystems and food security.” The Guardian has also seen a draft of the agenda for the leaders’ summit, which Brazil will host in Belém on 6 and 7 November, before the start of the fortnight-long Cop30 climate conference in the same city on 10 November. The plans reflect a divided government, with an uneasy coalition headed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that includes people ranging from some of the world’s most ambitious environmentalists to diehard supporters of agribusiness. The opening day will focus on forests, including a Brazilian initiative, supported by the UK and other European governments, to establish a “Tropical Forests Forever Facility” that aims to raise $125bn (£93bn) to support standing forests. This will be followed by a forest-themed afternoon of speeches, possibly including a “presentation by a representative of indigenous peoples”. On the second day, the leaked plans – still tentative – suggest there will be a discussion about the energy transition. This is a contentious topic. The world agreed at Cop28 in Dubai to “transition away from fossil fuels” , but last year, Saudi Arabia blocked attempts to move forward with this goal. In preliminary discussions for Cop30, Saudi Arabia has again tried to remove this from the agenda. But the Brazilian environment minister, Marina Silva, has pushed for more action and the leak suggests this will be under discussion by leaders. skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

Lula will also call for stronger action on debt forgiveness for poor countries, in exchange for investments in environmental protection and clean energy. A spokesperson from Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry said: “Brazil is not proposing that countries quadruple biofuels. The proponents of the pledge (which include Japan, Italy, India, among others) are calling upon countries to support quadrupling production and use of sustainable fuels — a group of gaseous and liquid fuels that include e-fuels, biogases, biofuels, hydrogen and its derivatives. “The proposed fourfold increase is a global goal (countries are not expected to individually quadruple production). It is based on an IEA report released this week that said this production increase is both feasible and necessary to reduce emissions, particularly from hard-to-abate sectors. The IEA report is a sound, scientific document underpinning the proposed Belém 4x pledge. The word ‘sustainable’ is not used lightly, neither in the report nor in the pledge. “For a fuel to be sustainable, it must have low-GHG intensity over its lifecycle, measured in grams of CO 2 equivalent by megajoule of fuel (gCO 2 ;MJ). It also needs to comply with a set of non-GHG criteria, such as biodiversity conservation, sustainable water management and compliance with social safeguards. These concerns are taken seriously and have been integrated into the design of the declaration itself.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/16/brazil-ask-countries-quadruple-biofuel-use-leak-suggests,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb8a507b22d85ca7275880d8647bb9115c60ee1/365_0_3637_2911/master/3637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06d9b610a3d137811f62ae7fa5ee12e0",2025-10-16T16:26:14+00:00,d1a41d0484b1c91428f9b977430bde28d0718ef9
91b680d7e357,Indigenous and environmental leaders in Ecuador say they are facing state intimidation,,"Indigenous and environmental leaders in Ecuador say they are facing a wave of state intimidation ahead of a national referendum next month on whether to rewrite the world’s only constitution that recognises the rights of nature. The pressure is being applied by the rightwing president, Daniel Noboa , who has begun his second term with a Trumpian agenda of consolidating power and sweeping away legal and social barriers to extractivist businesses, such as mining. The 37-year-old heir to the powerful Noboa family business group says the existing constitution is an obstacle to his national security and economic development agenda, which includes the construction of a US military base and new housing and hotel complexes on the Galápagos Islands, a Unesco world heritage site and biosphere reserve. The referendum on 16 November will decide whether to establish a constituent assembly to reform or replace the constitution, a process that would enable the president to put pressure on the main organisation that is resisting his push for more power: the constitutional court. It will also address several other far-reaching changes proposed by Noboa, including a reduction of seats in the legislative assembly, party funding and foreign military bases.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images The referendum will be the most controversial move yet by the president, who has already prompted alarm with several pieces of legislation that critics say undermine environmental safeguards and democratic checks and balances. A protected areas law, for example, purportedly enhances environmental sustainability and the management of conservation areas, but Indigenous groups say it is a ruse to bypass their right to free, prior and informed consent, while potentially opening up protected land to privatisation and extractive industries. A national solidarity law was ostensibly passed to strengthen the government’s authority and resources to tackle organised crime, but it has been used, say observers, to militarise public security and provide impunity for police and military killings carried out in the name of a war against gangs. A new intelligence law has given unprecedented surveillance powers to the administration, which can intercept communications without a court order. Meanwhile, a public integrity law, which claims to tame corruption, has become a tool to crack down on civil society. Social unrest has mounted steadily in Ecuador. The country has one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Rising prices of food and diesel have added to the tensions, prompting an ongoing national strike. Last month, an Indigenous land defender, Efraín Fueres, was shot and killed by the army during a protest against the high cost of living, a lack of medicine in hospitals, the deterioration of schools and growing social insecurity. Demonstrators are also angry that at least 61 civil society leaders and organisations have had their bank accounts frozen, pending an “unjustified private enrichment” investigation by the public prosecutors office. The Guardian has seen a list of those facing persecution. More than half were Indigenous activists, several of them campaigning against mines. Another quarter were environmental defenders. The rest were academics, journalists, women’s rights activists and local politicians. Among those under scrutiny was the Pachamama Foundation, which released a statement saying it would resist this attempted intimidation. “We categorically reject the criminalisation process that has been initiated,” thefoundation said. The accusations come at a time when Noboa’s administration has been criticised for pushing ahead with mining projects that had been blocked by public consultations, and accused of doing nothing to implement the 2023 referendum decision to halt oil production in block 43 of the Yasuni national park, an area of the Amazon rainforest famed for its ecological diversity. Instead, the president has subsumed the environment ministry inside the mining ministry. skip past newsletter promotion The planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Sebastien Lecocq/Alamy Alberto Acosta, who helped to draft the current constitution as a president of the last constituent assembly, said: “We have the only constitution in the world that recognises the rights of nature. All of this is being systematically trampled on by the government of President Daniel Noboa. The president does not want to respect the constitution or public consultation.” Acosta sees this as part of a global trend, led by the US president, Donald Trump: “What is happening in the United States is encouraging many governments in Latin America, and in Ecuador in particular, to mobilise extractivist forces that are destroying the ecological balance and affecting Indigenous communities.” Justices fear the rule of law is under threat; in recent months, the constitutional court has been the only brake on presidential power, successfully delaying several of Noboa’s moves to remove civil liberties or environmental protections. When the justices suspended security legislation in August, Noboa denounced them as “enemies of the people” and organised protests outside the court. In the past decade, Ecuador’s highest court has also set a global example in its rulings in favour of the rights of nature, most famously in 2021 when it declared mining permits in the Los Cedros cloud forest were unconstitutional because they threatened the biodiversity of a protected forest. The retired constitutional court judge Agustín Grijalva, who played a key role in the Los Cedros ruling, said his former colleagues were under intense pressure, which could get worse depending on the referendum outcome. “They want to reform or replace the constitution so they can impeach constitutional judges,” he said. “They will have their own court. And that is very dangerous for democracy and also for nature. It would put at risk all of the rulings of the past.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/indigenous-and-environmental-leaders-in-ecuador-say-they-are-facing-state-intimidation,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b1bbd531fcc476311df9a419fa76a5534604155/374_0_3737_2989/master/3737.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4be2ea482f8e970737b49e02e48fd272",2025-10-16T16:00:46+00:00,7fbd04eb79c2e1cc14400b89ed7b4ce05bf929a6
6781bd81f656,The 2025 Aussie Bird Count is about to start. Here’s how to take part – and why you should,,"How to join in with the Aussie Bird Count Taking part requires no prior birdwatching experience. BirdLife Australia’s “chief bird nerd”, Sean Dooley, says the process was designed to be accessible to all: 1. Register online . 2. Pick a spot. Choose any location, your back yard, balcony, local park or work window. 3. Take 20 minutes. Quietly observe and record the birds you see and hear in that location. 4. Submit your sightings. Log the species and numbers via the free Aussie bird count app or the BirdLife Australia website. The app offers an identification tool, allowing users to enter a bird’s size, colour and shape to get a list of possible candidates. Participants can count as many times as they would like during the week, as long as each count lasts 20 minutes and is submitted separately. Why take part in the Aussie Bird Count? Last year, more than 57,000 participants collectively tallied 4.1 million birds. The aggregated data is a powerful tool, especially since one in six Australian bird species is now under threat . After more than a decade of reports, the annual count enables BirdLife Australia to track long-term population shifts, identify which species are thriving, and understand the impact of urban development on our diverse bird communities. It is a simple, meditative act that contributes to a collective goal. “It really is a grounding experience, I find it incredibly relaxing, and the feedback we get from people is just that,” Dooley says. What is the power of a single survey? Every survey acts as a “pixel in a national snapshot”, Dooley says. “So the more pixels we have, the clearer the images.” The results of the count indicate some species thrive more than others. Last year the rainbow lorikeet topped the event as the most numerous bird recorded across the country – a position it’s held since the count began in 2014. It was followed by the noisy miner and the Australian magpie. Dooley says common, bold species continue to thrive, often to the detriment of smaller, more vulnerable birds. Aggressive species, like noisy miners, crows, ravens and butcherbirds, are increasingly competing for urban real estate, pushing smaller birds out. “After 11 years of the bird count, we’re seeing that the common birds continue to do well: the rainbow lorikeet, noisy miner, magpie, red wattlebird, the little corella,” Dooley says. Despite coming in third, the magpie was recorded by more individual people than any other species, spotted by one in two participants who completed the count. However, the data also highlights worrying trends. “Bird count trends show a decline in the reporting rates of small garden birds – including silvereyes and willy wagtails in almost every city,” Dooley says.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/17/aussie-bird-count-2025-how-to-take-part-and-why-you-should,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f5604bf0d58e1b10f54fb4563dc48380608cf/345_0_4170_3337/master/4170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=741277debf84c7474b8158534d1699e2",2025-10-16T14:00:46+00:00,e8f743cf56e0ff9c96329a64fb0ab97829a2fa8b
ad0e9c865b73,With climate trigger axed Labor wants to rush new environmental laws through after ‘positive’ talks with Coalition,,"The environment minister wants to pass a major re-write of federal nature laws this year, encouraging miners to lobby the Coalition to work with Labor to help rush it through parliament in the final three sitting weeks. Murray Watt relayed the message in private talks with mining industry leaders in Perth this week after giving a speech promising faster project approvals under a planned overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). On Friday, Watt will brief state and territory environment ministers on the reforms, which aim to finally act on recommendations from Graeme Samuel’s review of the EPBC Act after Anthony Albanese controversially shelved the previous iteration before the May election. Watt has publicly pledged to introduce the bill before the federal parliament rises for the year on 27 November. But Watt has privately expressed a desire to actually pass the laws in that time, which would leave just three weeks, or 12 sitting days, for parliament to scrutinise the most significant changes to the national environmental protection regime since the EPBC Act was legislated under John Howard in 1999. Despite its imminent introduction, details remain scarce. Even the select group of environment and industry lobby groups who meet weekly with Watt to discuss EPBC reform are yet to see draft legislation. Watt has made two announcements: the introduction of “no-go” and “go” zones that either ban or accelerate development approvals; and this week he announced plans for a bi-lateral agreement with Western Australia to allow the mining state – which opposed Labor’s original “nature positive” agenda – to assess projects under federal laws. He is open to similar agreements with other states. But other contentious elements, such as the power of the proposed federal environment protection agency and design of national environmental standards, are either yet to be finalised or remain under wraps. Labor does not have a majority in the Senate, meaning it must strike a quick deal with either the Coalition or the Greens if it wants the laws passed this year. While Watt remains open to either option, senior figures in the Albanese government are understood to favour a deal with the opposition, whose leader, Sussan Ley, commissioned the Samuel review as environment minister in the Morrison government. Watt has been privately encouraging business groups to lobby the Coalition to support the legislation, which would achieve industry’s desired outcome of sidelining the Greens and their push for a “climate trigger” to force decision-makers to factor in a project’s emissions during the assessment process. The shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, said she has had three “positive” meetings with Watt on the reforms, with a fourth imminent, indicating the Ley-led Coalition is far more open to working with Labor than it was under Peter Dutton. The Coalition will wait to see the legislation before deciding a position but the prospect of a deal has increased after Watt this month ruled out a “climate trigger”, even after environmentalists warned the reform would not be credible without it. The major sticking point for the Coalition is likely to be the powers of the environment protection agency, which Bell said must be limited to compliance and enforcement of nature laws – not decision-making on projects. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it would be a climb-down from the proposal Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, tried and failed to legislate in the last term. “There is a healthy level of scepticism around the detail, particularly in relation to a federal EPA and how that would work because there are already seven state and territory EPAs,” Bell said. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy Western Australia, which was among the mining lobby groups that met with Watt in Perth, reaffirmed the industry-wide view that the environment minister must retain decision-making powers. The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said a set of laws backed by industry and the Coalition spelt danger for nature and the climate. “Let’s cut through the spin: if the mining industry and the Liberals back this package, it says everything. It’s a deal for corporate profits, not a deal for nature or our climate,” she said. “No wonder the minister wants the legislation rammed through the Senate without proper scrutiny.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/17/with-climate-trigger-axed-labor-wants-to-rush-new-environmental-laws-through-after-positive-talks-with-coalition,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eda66735bf1b8bb18f71ba08ce1009970f28e68/344_0_5228_4183/master/5228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7653918b454169a05699cb3399b391d8",2025-10-16T14:00:46+00:00,769660601fda90842c1d5aa8041b4246f71dd24f
440afab29106,‘We want our stories to be told’: NSW Labor pledges $3.2m to support writing and literature amid AI onslaught,,"It is a sector that delivers $1.3bn annually to the New South Wales economy and supports up to 22,000 jobs, yet the average writer earns just $18,200 a year from their creative practice. To counter this stark disparity, the NSW government is launching the state’s first ever writing and literature strategy, and has committed $3.2m to support and grow the sector. The NSW arts minister, John Graham, said it was a response to urgent pressures, including low incomes, declining reading rates, and the growing impact of digital media and artificial intelligence on publishing. “This requires direct action, because there is too much to lose and so much to gain from a strong literary sector in NSW,” he said in a statement launching the Stories Matter strategy on Friday. “We want our stories to be told, we want to be part of the global literary conversation, and we rely on the social cohesion that comes from the nuance and empathy that books build.” Stories Matter reflects similar programs operating in Canada, Germany, France and Scandinavian countries. The NSW model will include $630,000 to support a public library membership campaign, including a pilot program to encourage women, girls and LGBTQ+ communities to take advantage of the free services and facilities offered by more than 360 public libraries across the state. A $200,000 development fund for First Nations writers and publishing professionals was also announced as part of the strategy, along with the establishment of up to four temporary and 12 to 24-month affordable housing residencies for artists, writers, playwrights and illustrators. The government will establish a $500,000 Literary Fellowships Fund to support authors, playwrights and illustrators, and a further $225,000 will fund three co-funded Writing Australia collaborations – including a program to develop an international marketing arm to promote sales of Australian writing abroad and financially support writers who are touring internationally. A further $100,000 will go to western Sydney literature organisations, including the delivery of a school-focused program and an emerging writers academy. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The multi-award-winning writer Charlotte Wood was used as a case study by the NSW government’s advisory panel working on the strategy. “I’m hopeful the strategy will recognise that Australian literature is not merely decorative, a nice thing somehow separate from the rest of life,” Wood said in a statement on Thursday. “Literature is absolutely central to the intellectual life and psychology of any nation. Australian books and writers are a dynamic contributor to the cultural, economic and political thinking that shapes our society. And unless governments begin to take reading and literary contribution seriously, that flourishing intellectual life is doomed to evaporate.” The novelist and critic James Bradley, whose work Deep Water was shortlisted for the 2025 Prime Minister’s Literary award for nonfiction, was on the advisory panel. “The NSW government’s new literature strategy will make a material difference to the lives of the state’s writers by investing in creators, strengthening the literary ecosystem, and fostering a range of new partnerships with universities, cultural institutions and other organisations,” he said. “But it also helps ensure the benefits of reading and writing are available to everybody by investing in programs to improve literacy and promote reading in schools, supporting First Nations writers and publishing professionals, and allowing readers of all ages to connect with writers through events in libraries and elsewhere.” The initiative comes in the wake of the Australian Society of Authors launching its latest defence against the onslaught of AI, confirming that Australian writers and illustrators could be eligible for compensation under a landmark US$1.5bn class action settlement against AI company Anthropic in the US. The lawsuit was brought by American writers who allege the company downloaded copyrighted books from the shadow library LibGen to train its chatbot. The ASA chief executive, Lucy Hayward, said the association’s searchable list of works would enable Australian writers and illustrators to check whether their creations are among the half a million included in the class action. But Hayward said she feared some Australian authors could miss out, even though their books were included in the pirated books dataset, because of the narrow definition of the case. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ASA is calling for the government to introduce a mandatory code of conduct that requires big tech to appropriately license the Australian copyright work they wish to use for AI training, as well as to pay ongoing fair compensation to Australian creators whose works have already been ingested – and from whom it is too late to seek consent – for as long as their work remains ingested in the models.” The Anthropic case is one of dozens of lawsuits currently before US courts addressing the use of copyrighted books by AI companies. As two neuroscientists filed a lawsuit last week in California against Apple , claiming the company used shadow libraries to illegally access thousands of pirated books to train its AI model, the Australian Productivity Commission was coming under fire in a parliamentary inquiry hearing for failing to consult anyone in the creative sector about AI’s impact on the arts – an oversight Wood described on Thursday as “an obscenity and a travesty”. In 2023 the Booker prize winner Richard Flanagan discovered his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North was one of as many as 18,000 fiction and nonfiction titles with Australian ISBNs that had been pirated by the US-based Books3 dataset and used to train generative AI for corporations such as Meta and Bloomberg. “I felt as if my soul had been strip-mined and I was powerless to stop it,” he said at the time. “This is the biggest act of copyright theft in history.” The head of policy at the Australian Publishers Association, Stuart Glover, said the Books3 case was ongoing. “Tech needs to stop pretending this is ‘fair use’ of authors’ and publishers’ work,” he said. “We hope future settlements at least meet the benchmarks set by the Anthropic case.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/16/nsw-government-funding-writing-literature-combat-ai-stories-matter,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c455ee5c7e196c7affc79d6387b4be2731dc90/437_0_4325_3460/master/4325.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=68a2192bdcc150f7e47b9457ebe01e41",2025-10-16T13:59:30+00:00,bea8ac8175a8b17eac01e50ce49e3fef32afcc1c

The Labor government’s unpopular bill to impose charges for FoI requests and dramatically curtail what information could be released seems set to fail after Liberal leader Sussan Ley said the opposition would vote against it – although attorney general Michelle Rowland said she remained “absolutely committed” to the proposal. Documents about the FoI proposal, released under FoI itself, reveal two government departments were concerned about a deluge of information requests from online tools. When Rowland announced the contentious proposal in September, which would also prevent anonymous users from requesting documents, she told parliament eSafety was an example of “why the current system is broken”, with the online safety regulator receiving nearly 600 FoI requests in a short period of time from an “automated generator”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email She said in September eSafety should focus on “protecting children rather than processing a mountain of frivolous FoI requests from online trolls”. The “automated generator” was a pre-filled form on a free speech activist website that allowed users to send FoI requests for documents eSafety might hold about their X account. Internal chat logs from February, released to transparency website Right to Know under freedom of information law, revealed panic setting in at the online safety regulator when the emails using this form began. “[They] have created a new tool which has been facilitating applicants sending in a new FoI request every five minutes or so (50 FoIs since 1pm),” the 5.45pm message stated on 8 February. “I am concerned that emails flowing in every few minutes may jam something and prevent work… I suppose or mailboxes are built to sustain that quantum but I wanted to check and make sure nothing needed to be done, just in case.” An anonymised IT staffer at eSafety dryly responded: “If it’s one email every five minutes that isn’t a concern at all from an IT perspective.” “I am concerned at the current pace, the emails might jam something. I am not sure how much data these mailboxes are built to hold,” the first staffer replied. In estimates briefing documents released under FoI in February 2025, eSafety said it had an 1,800% increase in FoI requests in the 2024-25 financial year, which was “largely due to eSafety’s rising public profile and strong regulatory posture, combined with ongoing litigation”. The documents stated that it was suggested to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner that there be reforms to the law to reduce these types of requests and “FoI-bombing”. One staffer in February emailed colleagues saying that there were a higher than usual number of FoI requests via this online tool and “we should not comment further”. “Of course, any discussion of this matter is in itself subject to FoI.” In a separate batch of FoI documents, published by Rowland’s own attorney general’s department , a general counsel in an unidentified branch of the public service claimed in emails that they were receiving a large amount of “AI generated requests/chat GPT responses”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They shared what they claimed were examples of AI-generated FoI requests or communications with their office from people seeking information. Also included in the released documents were “high-level talking points” for ministers and government officials, formulated by the attorney general’s department, which referred to the statistics cited by that office about their sample of AI-generated requests. The talking points said the department had sought advice from Australia’s National Intelligence Community about the risk of foreign adversaries using FoI to access government information, in response to the push to ban anonymous requests. The talking points said it was “not uncommon” for adversaries to seek information through legitimate processes like FoI, but claimed the government couldn’t say more because the intelligence advice was “classified”. The Freedom of Information Act already has specific exemptions to allow the refusal of requests or redaction of information “affecting national security, defence or international relations”. The bill will be examined in a parliamentary inquiry, with a first hearing to be held on Friday.

Salvador Illa, a close ally of Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez , has been in the post since August 2024 and leads the first Catalan parliament in 44 years without a pro-independence majority. The Socialists are in a paradoxical position: while Sánchez’s minority, coalition government depends on the votes of the pro-independence Junts party – led by Carles Puigdemont , the architect of the failed effort to secede from Spain in 2017 – Illa’s regional administration does not. The Catalan president’s separatist critics have derided him as an anaesthetist whose proximity to Madrid is sending Catalonia into a political coma. “What we are trying to do is to bring in an atmosphere of calm and coexistence,” the 59-year-old said in an interview with the Guardian. “What most people in Catalonia want is not just to generate prosperity because that is not enough. They want wealth shared. People will not understand if that prosperity is reserved to an elite, or to the big cities.” Pedro Sanchéz (R) with Salvador Illa at a Unesco conference in Barcelona in September Photograph: Toni Albir/EPA Alongside Illa’s economic agenda is a policy of assuaging Junts and Puigdemont, who remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels after the unilateral independence referendum that was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court. Puigdemont is negotiating a return, using his ability to bring down Sánchez’s minority government in Madrid as leverage to seek political amnesties, the transfer of migration policy to Catalonia and commitments to pursue Catalan as an official European language. Although Sánchez and Illa said before the 2023 national election that they would oppose amnesties, the Spanish parliament passed just such a law in May last year , pardoning those involved in the referendum. Outstanding charges of misuse of public funds against Puigdemont and two others – and not covered by the amnesty law – are also being examined by the constitutional court. Illa was frank about the switch over amnesty, saying: “The circumstances changed after the election and we have to take account of that.” Supporters of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont listen to a public address in Barcelona in August last year. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images He added: “It is about trying to find a way out. This is politics, a pragmatic approach to reality. What we are trying to do is produce an atmosphere of calm and coexistence.” Those who said the Socialists would only empower separatist politicians by making concessions to them had been proven wrong, Illa continued. “It has weakened the independence parties,” he said. “The problem was not that there are people that favour an independent Catalonia, the problem is about respecting the rule of law.” He said he would like to see Puigdemont back in Catalonia and active again in politics, and urged the constitutional court to try to settle the remaining issues as quickly as justice allowed. He had even travelled to Brussels to meet Puigdemont to prove – in his words - that dialogue was “the driving force in a democracy”. Illa ascribed both the nationalist surge in Catalonia that fuelled support for the 2017 referendum – and Brexit in the UK – as populist responses to the financial crisis of 2008. “It was a period when people were offered by quick easy magical solutions to complex problems,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Albert Llop/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock If Catalan nationalism was now on the wane, he argued, the responsibility laid in how Spanish democracy responded to it, the success of a common European approach to Covid, and the war in Ukraine “underlining the need to be part of a public space of 350 million people”. “It has produced a change in the Catalan mindset, and that it is good to be part of something bigger,” Illa added. In some ways, the new political threat that Illa and Junts face is from Aliança Catalana, the far-right, nativist party led by Sílvia Orriols, which thrives on its opposition to immigration and Islam. “Today we need to focus on defending the values of democracy against the far-right totalitarian project,” he said. Illa had identified the need to build and release more housing as the most effective route to tackling soaring rents he said were at the root of much inequality in Spain. He plans to build 50,000 homes for social rent and release land capable of absorbing another 210,000 properties. In the meantime, the national government has introduced a law allowing authorities to cap “disproportionate” rent prices in some areas , and from 2028 bans on Air B&B will be imposed in some cities. The best response, Illa added, was for “social democratic parties to stick to their policies, be bold and not to change our agenda or priorities [to those] of the far right”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/catalonia-socialist-president-salvador-illa-tackling-inequality-separatist-far-right-coexistence-madrid,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e87270573e17381181d7718b2c53f949a77fea3c/806_339_1676_1341/master/1676.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dd43ec1f039a973f6bd358e6c83aa0c",2025-10-16T16:31:21+00:00,9597bd407885a703b62b6385703f6b6f6fe181b7
02211833eed4,Russia bombards Ukraine’s gas sites as Zelenskyy flies to US for Trump meeting,,"A massive Russian drone and missile attack has hit gas facilities in eastern Ukraine as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy , flew to Washington for a meeting with Donald Trump to discuss the US providing Kyiv with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Russia launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, as well as glide bombs early on Thursday, sparking outages in eight regions in another large-scale bombardment targeting Ukraine’s energy network. “Russia launched more than 300 attack drones and 37 missiles, a significant number of them ballistic, against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on X. “This autumn, the Russians use every single day to strike at our energy infrastructure.” Zelenskyy said strikes had hit the regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy and Vinnytsia. One of the facilities hit was the Shebelinka gas processing plant in Kharkiv region, where large columns of black smoke and fiercely burning fires could be seen in the aftermath of the attack. Looping video of blaze at a Ukrainian gas facility after a Russian attack Staff at the plant told the Guardian that it had been hit just after 5.30am by drones and missiles, setting off at least two blazes in different parts of the facility. Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has attacked Ukrainian power infrastructure each winter, forcing Kyiv to impose emergency blackouts and import energy from abroad. Commenting on the strikes, the Russian defence ministry claimed it had hit facilities used by the Ukrainian military with Kinzhal missiles “in response” to attacks on Russian infrastructure, an apparent reference to strikes on refineries in Russia. Sergii Koretskyi, the chief executive of the Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz, said: “There are hits and destruction in several regions at once. The operation of a number of critically important facilities has been halted.” Ukraine’s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, introduced emergency power cuts in every region of the country after the attacks, it said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine’s air force said the Russian barrage comprised 320 drones and 37 missiles, adding that 283 drones and five missiles were downed. Map showing range of Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine to Russia It said the attacks mainly targeted the Kharkiv region in the north, and the eastern Poltava region, where the country’s largest private energy provider DTEK said a gas production facility was shut down. Media reports earlier suggested about 60% of Ukrainian gas production had been halted in recent Russian strikes, and attacks on power stations had cut electricity supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine. The latest strikes came as the Ukrainian military said North Korean troops based in Russia were operating drones across the border on reconnaissance missions – the first time Kyiv has reported a battlefield role for North Koreans in months. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine later said the North Koreans were withdrawn after suffering heavy casualties. Ukrainian troops were pushed out of Kursk in March this year and have not reported engaging North Koreans on the battlefield since. Zelenskyy is expected in Washington on Friday for talks with Trump, after two phone calls between the two leaders over the weekend. Their relationship has warmed since February, when they sparred during an infamous televised meeting at the White House. Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow, showing mounting frustration with Vladimir Putin, while expressing sympathy for Ukraine. Senior Ukrainian officials visiting the Washington this week met representatives of US weapon manufacturers including Raytheon, which produces Tomahawk missiles. Zelenskyy will also meet arms makers to discuss when deliveries to Kyiv could begin, a source told Agence France-Presse. “But they need a political signal,” the source added. Russia has warned that sending Tomahawks to Ukraine – which would put Moscow and other large Russian cities within range of missile fire – would rupture its ties with Washington and cause further escalation. The source declined to disclose how many of the long-range missiles Trump is considering sending to Ukraine, saying only the arsenal would be “enough for Putin to feel it”.

9f4ee73d4598,‘It’s been a shock’: Taylor Swift fans flock to see German museum’s Ophelia,,"A 200-year-old museum in Germany has found itself in the eye of a storm of delighted Taylor Swift fans when it emerged that one of the probable inspirations for the music video of her new song The Fate of Ophelia was hanging on its wall. In the opening scene of the clip for the first song on Swift’s blockbuster new album The Life of a Showgirl, one of the world’s biggest pop stars assumes the role of the tragic Shakespearean character. The video , released earlier this month, was watched more than 27m times on YouTube in the first three days. Since then, fans have been flocking to Museum Wiesbaden in the western German city to see a painting by Friedrich Heyser from about 1900 that appears to have served as the model for Swift’s own take. Taylor Swift’s Fate of Ophelia video “We are having an absolute Ophelia run at the moment and are quite surprised and happy about it,” a museum spokesperson, Susanne Hirschmann, said on Thursday. “It’s been a shock, to be honest. We have a colleague who has a friend who is a Swift fan and she noticed the video’s opening scene had a similarity [with the Heyser painting] and we thought, wow, what a coincidence – that’s exciting.” Although the museum has been unsuccessful so far in its attempts to reach Swift’s team, it did not take long for fans to make the connection themselves, as word spread on social media. Hirschmann estimated that 500 people visited last weekend specifically to see Heyser’s Ophelia painting, having asked museum personnel where they could find it – far eclipsing the usual amount of interest in the wispily romantic image showing Ophelia’s rosebud lips slightly parted and her lifeless body surrounded by water lilies. The visitors, many of them young women and girls, have been posing for photos before the painting. “It’s a lot more teens than we usually see,” Hirschmann said. She said the museum, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, was caught completely off guard by its brush with Swift-mania. Hirschmann said: “We have a wonderful art nouveau collection. Many of our guests want to see Alphonse Mucha; they want to see Hector Guimard. But this is the first time we’ve really had a run on a painting.” “I always liked it,” she said of the Heyser portrait, adding: “Thanks to Taylor Swift , it’s entered a whole new dimension.” At first, the museum’s management was worried that a rush of Swifties could be disruptive to the other guests, but Hirschmann said the fans had “a respectful approach”. “It’s really lovely for us that suddenly everybody is talking about art too, thanks to a global star like Taylor Swift,” she said. “It’s crazy.” It is not the first time the singer has borrowed from Shakespeare for material, with the 2008 hit Love Story taking a page from Romeo and Juliet. It is unclear why Swift appears to have drawn inspiration from Heyser’s vision of Hamlet’s Ophelia, who drowns in a river after her lover accidentally kills her father. In Swift’s song, the “eldest daughter of a nobleman” who “lived in fantasy” meets a happier ending. Initially, Swift watchers thought she had found her muse for the opening scene of the video in the better-known work by John Everett Millais from 1852 at London’s Tate museum, but the colour of the dress and the angle of her pose pointed them to Heyser. Now, staff in Wiesbaden are speculating whether the American superstar had been in their midst to see the painting for herself without their knowledge, perhaps during her three-city sweep through Germany in July 2024 during the Eras tour. “That would be truly insane!” Hirschmann said. “We did ask ourselves: how did this come about? Did she pick the painting out? Has she seen it for herself? Was it a member of her team? I think if Taylor Swift came here, even incognito, we would have noticed.” Seizing on the unexpected opportunity, the museum has organised an Ophelia reception on 2 November, including a guided tour explaining the history of the painting, Shakespeare’s character and her depiction in Swift’s tune.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/16/taylor-swift-fans-german-museum-fate-of-ophelia-painting,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a0f42ac5dbbc736649b556cbbba59c81688768/93_0_1245_996/master/1245.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e17c125f7e3f0b7d141aff520b566d8",2025-10-16T16:23:05+00:00,277683c16a0ffd77107bd1622452e55bf0570483
deeb6e6f175c,"Pets on flights can be classed as baggage, top EU court rules",,"Pets on flights can be classified as baggage, the European court of justice has ruled, meaning airlines are not required to pay higher compensation if the animal is lost. The ECJ, Europe’s highest court, was asked to intervene after a dog was lost during a journey from Buenos Aires to Barcelona, triggering a claim for losses from the owner. The court heard that the passenger and her mother checked into the flight with the dog, Mona, which was put in a special pet crate. However, the dog escaped while it was being taken to the plane and was never recovered, prompting a claim of €5,000 (£4,340) for “non-material damage” by the passenger, and a six-year court case. The airline involved, Iberia , accepted liability for the loss of the pet but not the size of the claim, arguing it exceeded the liability for lost luggage without any special declarations as to the crate’s contents. The court said the passenger, a girl named Felicísima in documents, and her mother made no special declarations in relation to the baggage when checking it in and could not therefore make a claim for these losses. Pets are not often seen on European flights but are more common on transatlantic flights, with small dogs allowed in the cabin. Larger dogs, like the one at the centre of this lawsuit, are required to be placed in the hold by airlines that allow pet travel. “The dog got out of the carrier, started running near the plane and could not be recovered,” the ECJ papers say. At an earlier court hearing in Spain , it was heard that, despite an intense campaign on social media launched by Felicísima, the dog has never been recovered. Felicísima said she would never give up her search, saying it was “a disgrace” if someone in Buenos Aires had taken her dog and claimed it as their own. “Who has Mona, knowing that she is ours; knowing the pain we have felt?” she asked in a Facebook post.The case sets a precedent for anyone travelling with pets who does not make a special declaration about the contents of the pet crate and the animal is lost. The girl’s lawyer in Madrid, Carlos Villa Corta, said he disagreed with the arguments made in the Luxembourg court, claiming “no airline in the world will accept a special declaration of value” for a pet in the hold. “I believe that a great opportunity has been missed to continue raising awareness of the rights of animals and the people who care for them. Ultimately, the ECJ considers that pets do not deserve special or enhanced legal protection compared to a simple suitcase.” The judge in the Spanish court referred the case to the ECJ to examine a matter of law at the heart of the case: whether the concept of baggage applied to the dog in the crate under the Montréal convention, an international treaty setting out rules for airlines’ liability for losses ranging from death to delays and lost cargo or baggage. The ECJ said: “The Montréal convention clearly refers to persons and baggage. It therefore follows from the clear wording of this provision that the term ‘persons’ covers ‘passengers’, such that a pet cannot be considered a ‘passenger’. “It must therefore be considered that, for the purposes of air transport, a pet falls within the concept of ‘baggage’ and compensation for damage resulting from its loss during such transport is subject to the liability regime laid down for baggage.” The judge also noted that the liability of an airline for lost baggage could be determined by any special declaration on contents – which did not happen in this case. As a special declaration about the animal was not made before the flight, Felicísima was entitled to only €1,578.82, the Spanish court ruled. In a statement, the ECJ said: “The fact that the protection of animal welfare is an objective of general interest recognised by the European Union does not prevent animals from being transported as ‘baggage’ and from being regarded as such for the purposes of the liability resulting from the loss of an animal.”",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/oct/16/pets-on-flights-can-be-classed-as-baggage-iberia,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c37bbe9829b8a5be280ad6b9b690bfc93b564ef9/0_0_877_702/master/877.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4e4ce944dc4e936311f50eb52b98b73",2025-10-16T15:34:54+00:00,ac5d18c672aded8a1e0bf3763128108489e033c0
67afac194d54,Spanish police investigate as Picasso painting vanishes on way to exhibition,,"Police in Spain are investigating the disappearance of a tiny Picasso painting, worth €600,000 (£520,000), which vanished en route from Madrid to an exhibition in the southern city of Granada. The gouache and pencil work, Naturaleza muerta con guitarra ( Still Life with Guitar), was due to go on show at a new exhibition at the CajaGranada foundation, which opened last week. But the picture, which was painted in 1919 and measures 12.7cm x 9.8cm, never made it to the foundation’s Still Life: the Eternity of the Inert exhibition. The painting belongs to a private collector in the Spanish capital and had been expected as part of a consignment of loaned exhibits that arrived by van from Madrid on Friday 3 October. The foundation said that when the van arrived at 10am that day, its contents were unloaded and checked. Despite the fact that some of the carefully packaged works were not correctly numbered, making “an exhaustive check” impossible, the delivery was signed off and the van and its crew went on their way. The following Monday, the pieces, which had been under video surveillance all weekend, were unpacked. “Once the unpacking had been done, by the CajaGranada foundation’s own staff, the works were moved to different parts of the exhibition room,” the foundation said in a statement. “Mid-morning that day, the exhibition’s curator and the foundation’s head of exhibitions noticed that one work was missing. The piece is a small gouache by Pablo Picasso , called Still Life with Guitar.” The foundation said it had reported the painting’s disappearance to the Policía Nacional, adding: “We have also put ourselves at the disposal of those investigating, and we have complete faith that the case will be properly resolved.” Spanish media reports suggested the van may have stopped overnight near Granada, and that the two people aboard may have taken turns guarding its precious cargo. Picasso’s fame – and the enormous sums his works command – have long made his art a target for thieves around the world. In February 2007, two Picasso paintings worth a total of €50m were stolen from the Paris home of the artist’s granddaughter . Two years later, a Picasso sketchbook worth more than €8m was stolen from a Paris museum dedicated to the artist. Twelve Picasso paintings, valued at around £9m, were stolen from the French Riviera villa of another of his grandchildren, Marina Picasso, in 1989. Several other Picasso paintings have been stolen from galleries. In 1976, 118 works were stolen from a museum in the southern city of Avignon in one of France’s largest art thefts. In 1997, a gunman walked into a central London art gallery and stole Picasso’s Tête de Femme , worth more than £500,000, before fleeing in a taxi.

3faf3947331d,India casts doubt on Trump’s claims that it has agreed to stop buying Russian oil,,"India has cast doubt on claims by Donald Trump that its prime minister, Narendra Modi, had agreed to stop buying Russian oil. On Wednesday, Trump claimed that Modi had assured him “today” that India would put an end to its purchase of Russian oil. “I was not happy that India was buying oil, and he [Modi] has assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. You know, you can’t do it immediately. It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” Trump told reporters, before claiming he would soon convince China of the same thing. However, in a press briefing on Thursday Indian officials appeared to undermine the US president’s account, stating that there was “no telephonic conversation between PM Modi and US President Trump yesterday”. India, which maintains a strong relationship with the Kremlin, has become one of the biggest purchasers of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine . It has been a significant source of contention with Washington in recent months since Trump failed to secure a peace deal with Russia. In August, the US president imposed some of his highest tariffs on India to penalise its purchase of Russian oil as he accused Delhi of helping to finance Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. India is subject to additional 25% import tariffs, on top of a base of 25%. India has publicly stood firm, claiming it would not let the US dictate its energy needs or interfere in its relationship with Russia, which dates back to the cold war. Russia remains the largest supplier of arms to India. Earlier on Wednesday, the Indian government said discussions with the US over trade and tariffs were ongoing. A statement by the Indian ministry of external affairs said the priority was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that all policies were dictated by the imperative to diversify and secure India’s energy sources. India has reaped significant benefit from its purchase of cut-price Russian oil since the Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, becoming one of its top purchasers globally, second only to China. However, it has led to a severe deterioration in US-India relations. The White House has increasingly sought to accuse Delhi of bankrolling the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s actions against Ukraine, describing the conflict as “Modi’s war”. However, on Wednesday the US president spoke glowingly of Modi. ““Modi is a great man. He loves Trump,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/india-casts-doubt-on-trumps-claims-that-it-has-agreed-to-stop-buying-russian-oil,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6075b72a217452981d2ada9b594c8c259d7bd149/530_0_5281_4228/master/5281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=748a9a4be65d8d364b5a894b69db2520",2025-10-16T17:18:07+00:00,0e2d0f3e6f932ee52058dc96cc3dbdb4110918f7
6a5ffa62e80c,Timely arrival: Great British Railways clock launches at London Bridge,,"Commuters rushing through London Bridge station may have missed it, but on Thursday morning a new era in railway timekeeping and design was looming above them: a 1.8-metre-high digital timepiece, hanging above the concourse, the first physical manifestation of the Great British Railways ’ signature station clock. The design, the first such for more than 50 years, will appear in digital form on electronic information boards at stations across Britain. The black and red clock face draws on the old British Rail logo, which the rail minister, Peter Hendy, said “represents a bridge between the historic past and a new future for our railways”. The railway, 200 years old this year, played a pivotal role in creating a unified national time zone, with cities previously setting their own clocks by the sun; Bristol remained 10 minutes behind London for some decades before the demands of fast trains and a railway timetable made it catch up. London Bridge was chosen for the prestigious first clock and ceremonial opening as it was the second station in 1852 to have an electronic clock linked by telegraph to the Greenwich Observatory (the first was Lewisham, earlier that year). The design, chosen in an international competition for architects and designers, was selected for ease of reading as well as reflecting the railways’ brand. Mark Wood, a creative partner at the winning agency, Design Bridge and Partners, said he hoped it would become “the face of time across the railway for many years to come”. London Bridge was chosen for the prestigious first clock as it was the second station in 1852 to have an electronic clock linked by telegraph to the Greenwich Observatory. Photograph: Matt Crossick/PA The new clock at London Bridge features only hours and minutes in numerals, with seconds represented by the “double arrow” of the British Rail logo – splitting in two before circling the face as if on opposing tracks, rejoining hypnotically every minute. According to the designers, “this subtle yet powerful visual metaphor speaks to the constant flow and convergence of journeys”. After the garish advertising boards at Euston , could this once again risk passengers missing their train? The Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, was quick to dispel suggestions the rebrand would signal a more relaxed attitude to time. “There will be seconds displayed in full on platforms,” he said. “As a railwayman, there was no way I was having a clock without seconds.” While the success of the clock will be measured over decades, some are already enthusiastic. Gerry Barney, who created the old British Rail logo in 1965, was approached by the clock’s designers and pronounced himself “thrilled … what [they] have created is really magic”. At London Bridge, Tim Dunn, a rail historian, said of the design: “When I first saw, it I cried.” (In a good way.) A pop-up shop at the mainline station was selling expensive rail-branded merchandise and the swish design of the clock face could be another design hit, the rail industry hopes. An app is planned to allow smartwatch wearers to download the clock face for their own wrists. Hendy, who was proudly sporting a (borrowed) smartwatch with the new design, said that as the government continues in its labours to rebuild a nationalised, integrated railway for passengers, “good design, like this brilliant, clever timepiece, is a fundamental part of achieving this”. The unified design would make stations instantly recognisable, following a plethora of different clocks after rail was privatised and fragmented, the rail minister said.

ec1675430794,"Brace for early flu season in England and get vaccinated, say experts",,"The flu season could be coming early this year, public health experts in England have said, adding that those who are eligible for a free vaccination should take up their offer. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), an increase in flu levels in England is being driven by cases among younger adults and schoolchildren. It comes as Japan’s health authorities declared an influenza epidemic , with a higher than usual number of infections for the time of year. A report by the UKHSA suggests that while flu levels are rising in England, they remain within baseline – or typical – seasonal ranges. But it added that the levels were similar to those seen when the flu season came early in 2022-23. Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: “It looks like flu cases are going up early this year. Seasonal epidemics often get going in children first and then spread through the adult population.” According to the latest report by the UKHSA , which covers 6-12 October, influenza-like-illness consultations in primary care rose to 5.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 4.2 per 100,000 in the previous week. There has also been a rise in influenza hospitalisations, increasing to 1.27 per 100,000 people in the most recent week, compared with 0.73 per 100,000 the week before. Dr Conall Watson, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: “This week’s data is showing a rise in positive tests for flu, particularly in children and younger adults, as well an increase in GP and A&E attendances. It is relatively early in the autumn to be seeing these increases and we will be monitoring this closely in the coming weeks.” Watson added that it was “absolutely crucial” for everyone eligible for a flu vaccine to book their appointment. “It could make all the difference in avoiding severe illness and hospitalisation,” he said. Among those eligible for a free flu jab are people aged 65 or over, pregnant women, people with certain long-term health conditions and people who live in a care home. A nasal spray vaccination is also available for children. skip past newsletter promotion Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finn also stressed the importance of vaccination, adding that those not eligible for a free dose could buy one at a pharmacy. “Don’t make the mistake of assuming flu is always a mild disease. Even among children we see severe cases admitted to hospital every winter,” he said. “Vaccination reduces the risk of getting flu and of getting seriously ill with it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/16/brace-for-early-flu-season-in-england-and-get-vaccinated-say-experts,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f608ce6aa5988d671fdbea3f82f30a58485513/946_0_6261_5008/master/6261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2bc405e66471cd3777f84f097d75c0f",2025-10-16T16:43:19+00:00,30438a67f51f59ceee0d74b69585305051939358
626cce5afd6d,Cardiff becomes first UK council to impose higher parking charges on larger vehicles,,"Cardiff council will force drivers with larger vehicles to pay more for parking, becoming the first local authority in the UK to impose a parking premium to combat the dangers of larger vehicles. Councillors voted on Thursday to approve a new parking plan for the city which will see owners of larger vehicles charged more for parking permits because their cars “take up more parking space and are a danger to other road users”. The plan states that vehicles that weigh over 2,400kg fully laden will be subject to a surcharge “to encourage drivers to switch to smaller vehicles”; this will later be reduced to 2,000kg for non-electric vehicles. There has been a growing backlash against the sharp increase in large vehicles on roads, which cause more pollution and are more likely to cause fatalities if involved in a collision. Research has shown that sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which combine features of a passenger car with an off-road vehicle, have increased from 3% to 30% of existing cars in the past two decades . Oliver Lord, the UK head of campaign group Clean Cities, said “other cities across the UK could learn from Cardiff’s leadership”. “Cardiff is showing real vision by standing up to the SUV ‘carspreading’ that is taking over our streets,” he said. “It’s only fair that those driving the biggest, heaviest and most polluting vehicles pay more for the extra space and danger they bring.” The Welsh capital is following in the footsteps of Paris which last year tripled parking charges for SUV-style vehicles, leading to a two-thirds reduction in the number of SUVs using surface parking . The decision in Cardiff follows a public consultation in which two-thirds (66%) of respondents said they agreed that larger vehicles should pay more for permits. Dan De’Ath, the cabinet member for transport, said SUVs were “much larger than your average car, they produce far more wear and tear on our roads, but fundamentally if you hit a child while driving a heavy SUV the chances of that child dying are grossly inflated”. “We don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask people driving those kinds of vehicles to pay a little bit more for road wear and the extra space they take up,” he said. “We’re not taking about SUV-shaped cars, we’re talking about very heavy American-style vehicles. “It’s not about banning things, it’s about gently encouraging behaviour change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/16/cardiff-becomes-first-uk-council-to-impose-higher-parking-charges-on-larger-vehicles,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/803e26250d6a84d46b0452142972cfd493ba020f/46_0_3480_2784/master/3480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e62c4ff2e0afabeacd72094afea9eca8",2025-10-16T16:43:13+00:00,f7966c4edbb196c1211fe245e8ead021181902d8
d8a964d9ed0a,"US ‘on a trajectory’ toward authoritarian rule, ex-officials warn",,"The United States is “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to a stark new intelligence-style assessment by former US intelligence and national security officials, who warn that democratic backsliding is accelerating under the Trump administration – and may soon become entrenched without organized resistance. The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, was released on Thursday by the Steady State, a network of more than 340 former officers of the CIA, NSA, state department, and other national-security agencies. The authors conclude with “moderate to high confidence” that the US is moving toward what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections and courts continue to function, but are “systematically manipulated” to consolidate executive power and weaken checks and balances. According to the assessment, these trends are increasingly visible in the US, as part of a broader effort by Donald Trump in his second term to “ensure loyalty and ideological conformity” across the federal government. To conduct the assessment, the authors applied the same analytic methods used by US intelligence agencies to assess the fragility of democracies abroad but turned them inward for what the group called a “first-of-its-kind” analysis of domestic democratic decline. “We wrote it because the same tools we once used to assess foreign risks now show unmistakable warning signs at home,” the authors said in a statement. Since returning to the White House, the president has pardoned January 6 rioters who assaulted police, fired independent watchdogs, purged career officials viewed as disloyal, publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute political opponents, deployed troops to US cities, attacked judges who ruled against him, threatened universities and restricted press freedom – all while testing the boundaries of executive power in ways federal courts have repeatedly deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional. Just last week, Trump’s justice department indicted Letitia James , the New York attorney general who successfully sued him for fraud, and separately charged the former FBI director James Comey , a longtime political adversary. He has also called for jailing the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker , and Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, both Democrats who opposed his deployment of federal troops there. While the report mirrors the “finished intelligence” model used by the US intelligence community, the authors emphasize that this analysis was conducted entirely by private citizens and relied only on open-source material such as news reports, public statements and independent watchdog analyses, as opposed to classified intelligence. Among the key indicators of democratic decline identified in the report: the expansion of executive power through unilateral decrees and emergency authorities; the politicization of the civil service and federal law enforcement; attempts to erode judicial independence through strategic appointments and “noncompliance” with court rulings or investigations; a weakened and increasingly ineffective Congress; partisan manipulation of electoral systems and administration; and the deliberate undermining of civil society, the press, and public trust. “We judge that the primary driver of the US’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of Executive Branch overreach,” the assessment states. It also cites a “worrying” shift in public opinion among Americans, pointing to surveys that show a growing share who think “having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections” is a “very good or fairly good system”. The report’s findings are echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses. A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017. On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54. Political scientists and human rights activists have increasingly drawn comparisons between the US and countries like Hungary or Turkey, where elected leaders retained power by weakening institutional checks while preserving a democratic facade. “Absent organized resistance by institutions, civil society, and the public, the United States is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion,” the Steady State report concludes, “risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/trump-authoritarianism-warning,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fee4f7a0e64df0d8620012c6bef4e69072ab45/512_0_3544_2835/master/3544.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=802095bd6b6320948eb94a2b41b53936",2025-10-16T17:00:47+00:00,146d0e6d2062edf3c56b1c8d5b34e7113c582639
5e9cade1445a,"Virginia Giuffre’s story reveals system in which men abuse women with impunity, UK campaigners say",,"Virginia Giuffre’s latest revelations are a “mirror held up to a system” that still enables powerful men to groom, abuse and exploit women with impunity, women’s rights campaigners have said. Excerpts from Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, which were released ahead of the book’s publication next week, lay bare how Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell took advantage of their position of power to manipulate and groom Giuffre. In the posthumously published text , Giuffre warns that more women will suffer similar experiences if people continue to believe that Epstein was “an anomaly, an outlier”. She wrote: “The way he viewed women and girls – as playthings to be used and discarded – is not uncommon among certain powerful men who believe they are above the law. And many of those men are still going about their daily lives, enjoying the benefits of their power.” Her view was echoed by women’s rights experts and campaigners, who told the Guardian that wide-ranging reforms were needed to challenge deep-rooted societal and institutional misogyny. Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and women’s rights campaigner, described the memoir as both a “personal account of unimaginable abuse” as well as “a mirror held up to a system that still enables powerful men to exploit girls and women with impunity”. She added that the account exposes “the network of privilege” that protected Epstein and Maxwell. “Epstein was not an aberration, he was a symptom of a culture that normalises male entitlement and protects those at the top,” she said. Mags Lesiak, a criminologist at the University of Cambridge who researches gender-based violence, agreed that the memoir underscores how “sexual exploitation is not an individual aberration – it’s a system”. “Grooming doesn’t begin with violence. It begins with flattery, opportunity, charm, and access,” she said, noting that despite public scepticism about Giuffre’s lack of agency, her research shows that psychological dependence is created long before violence happens. “What’s most chilling is not Epstein’s uniqueness, but how unexceptional his methods were. The psychology of coercive control, emotional conditioning and ‘reward-punishment’ cycles, mirrors what we see in countless abuse cases – from elite trafficking networks to private homes.” Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) said the memoir sheds light on the ways “perpetrators with power, wealth and status are able to silence victims of sexual violence by weaponising the law”. “This entitlement has its roots in gender inequality and the power and control it produces. Until we tackle inequality, we won’t address the root causes of violence against women and girls,” she said. Giuffre, who died by suicide on 25 April 2025, wrote in her book that many people were complicit in Epstein’s crimes, because they “watched and they didn’t care”. Gemma Sherrington, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Refuge, said violence against women is known to “thrive in silence”, which is amplified by the way it “continues to be trivialised or outright ignored to this day”. “Throughout history, survivors who have fought to break that silence have been scrutinised, ridiculed and disbelieved – simply for having the courage to challenge not only their perpetrator, but the systems that enable misogyny to persist,” she said. She urged a whole-society approach to tackle violence against women and girls, starting with education to challenge pervasive societal attitudes, and increased funding for specialist support services, but also emphasising the need to listen to survivors, especially in the justice system. Lindsey Blumell, an academic at City, University of London, who has produced a documentary on sexual assault, noted that Giuffre and her peers “experienced greater backlash and negative consequences for telling their stories than most of the men they’ve accused”. “In a system where there is little justice for sexual abuse survivors, there can be no realistic expectation of avoiding sexual abuse in the future,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/16/virginia-giuffres-story-jeffrey-epstein-system-men-abuse-women-impunity-campaigners-say,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247cdb3c99d0559da78a87e05dfc8672defe8a43/283_0_3720_2976/master/3720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bced9bd9da532e29b7b9fc7ea9be93fb",2025-10-16T16:58:28+00:00,09058383e88e45db49b4f7de36193dda4400dba2
ba77326ab7ba,Queer and trans immigrants allege forced labor and sexual assault in Ice facility: ‘I was treated worse than an animal’,,"Queer and trans immigrants at a detention facility in south Louisiana have alleged that they faced sexual harassment and abuse, medical neglect and coerced labor by staff at the facility, and that they were repeatedly ignored or faced retaliation for speaking out. In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana, said they were recruited into an unsanctioned work program that forced them to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. Detainees also alleged that queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who stalked, harassed and sexually assaulted them. Three current and former detainees who spoke to the Guardian said that, between 2023 and 2025, they endured months of abuse from an assistant warden named Manuel Reyes and his associates. In their complaints to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the detainees also said that they faced retaliation for reporting the abuse to authorities, alleging that Reyes and other staff beat them and denied them medical treatment. “I was treated worse than an animal,” said Mario Garcia-Valenzuela, one of the detainees. “We don’t deserve to be treated like this.” Garcia-Valenzuela, a trans man detained at SLIPC, has alleged that, as part of the unsanctioned work program, Reyes forced him to move heavy cabinets and cinder blocks, and to clean using industrial-strength chemicals without gloves or protective gear. When Garcia-Valenzuela complained of injuries from the work program, he said, Reyes and his associates forcefully stripped him naked and mocked him. Kenia Campos-Flores. Photograph: Kenia Campos-Flores Kenia Campos-Flores, who is trans and non-binary, told the Guardian that they suffered from persistent migraines and chest pain after exposure to cleaning chemicals they were made to use during unofficial, overnight work shifts. Campos-Flores also alleged in a complaint they were persistently sexually harassed by Reyes, who entered their dorm and stole possessions including their boxers. Another trans detainee, Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, complained that a stripper chemical he was told to use to clean the facility floors seeped through his fabric shoes and burned the skin of his feet. On more than one occasion, while Renteria-Gonzalez was bent over cleaning, he said, Reyes came up from behind and inappropriately touched him. The assistant warden also told Renteria-Gonzalez he was watching the detainee through security cameras, including while he was showering. A fourth detainee, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, is a cisgender, queer woman who said that Reyes forced her to perform oral sex on him on a “near daily basis” between February and May 2024, threatening to kill her if she refused, according to her complaint. Doe, who was deported to the Dominican Republic in January this year, has chosen not to share her name or speak publicly because she fears that Reyes will make good on his threat to find and harm her, her lawyer said. Taken together, the detainees’ stories present a troubling pattern of mistreatment and abuse inside SLIPC, their attorneys said. Though the alleged abuse took place across two presidential administrations, advocates worry that conditions inside detention facilities could further deteriorate amid the Trump administration ’s present push to arrest and detain a record number of immigrants. Trans and queer immigrants in detention are especially vulnerable, advocates said, given that the administration is also moving to roll back key civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people in federal custody. The detainees’ allegations are detailed in four separate administrative complaints filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue the government for injuries caused by federal employees. The government has six months to adjudicate the complaints, or the claimants could move forward with a federal lawsuit. They were submitted in September by Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project. Those groups have also submitted a civil rights complaint to the DHS oversight bodies, including the office for civil rights and civil liberties (CRCL), on behalf of the detainees. “This was a sadistic late-night work program,” said Sarah Decker, a senior staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. “It was designed to target vulnerable trans men or masculine-presenting LGBTQ people, who [Reyes] coerced into participating.” When detainees tried to report their abuse, Decker said, Ice officials repeatedly disregarded them. Officials dismissed multiple reports of abuse in accordance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), Decker said, as well as complaints to the Ice office of inspector general (OIG), the department charged with oversight of Ice. These people screamed for help. They filed grievances. They filed complaints. They did everything. And they were ignored Sarah Decker, RFK Human Rights “These people screamed for help. They filed grievances. They filed complaints under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, they filed verbal complaints through the office of the inspector general. They did everything to get help,” Decker said. “And they were systematically ignored, and complaints were buried.” The Guardian attempted to locate Reyes though multiple means, including public records and social media searches and were unable to contact him. Reyes is not facing criminal charges for the alleged sexual abuse at the facility. He is no longer employed at SLIPC, Decker said – he left the facility in July 2024. But, Renteria-Gonzalez and Garcia-Valenzuela, who remain detained at SLIPC, told the Guardian other staff at the facility have continued to retaliate against them, placing them in solitary confinement and denying them full access to medical care. The DHS and Ice did not respond to the Guardian’s queries about the detainees’ allegations, nor did the agencies address whether any of the detainees’ Prea complaints were investigated. ‘It’s devastating and heartbreaking, everything that they do to us in here’ Located about 90 miles (145km) from the Gulf coast in the rural town of Basile, Louisiana, SLIPC was once a correctional facility. But in 2019, it opened as an Ice detention facility, operated by Geo Group, one of the largest private prison and surveillance firms in the US. Over the past several years, the detention center, which houses mostly women as well as a few trans people, has attracted a string of allegations of civil and human rights violations, medical neglect and poor hygiene. In 2022, an internal inspection by the office of the immigration detention ombudsman – an independent office within the Department of Homeland Security – found that the facility had insufficient medical staffing, and had been inconsistent in addressing the medical and mental health needs of detainees. A 2025 report by the Yale Law School also found that detainees were “left hungry, cold, and in an atmosphere detainees describe as abusive”.

Photograph: Google Maps “It’s devastating and heartbreaking, everything that they do to us in here,” said Renteria-Gonzalez, who first arrived at the facility in May 2023. “We struggle on a daily basis.” He said his decision to remain in detention while his immigration case is under review – rather than accept deportation – has been painful. Renteria-Gonzalez came to the US when he was 12 and has been in the country for 31 years. His eight-year-old daughter is a US citizen. “It is for my daughter and my family that I have endured everything that I have in this detention facility for the past 28 months,” he said. “It’s so that I can make it back home to her.” Monica Renteria-Gonzalez. Photograph: Monica Renteria-Gonzalez Renteria-Gonzalez said Reyes first recruited him to participate in the late-night work program in September 2023, according to his complaint. Reyes would often come into his dorm late at night – at around 2 or 3am – to wake him up for his night shift. “It’s like he lived [at the detention center] 24/7,” Renteria-Gonzalez told the Guardian. Each recruit worked alone, during different times or in different parts of the detention facility – meaning they were often alone with Reyes, the detainees allege. During these times, Renteria-Gonzalez said, he would watch them work and probe them with invasive and inappropriate questions. “It made me feel uncomfortable,” he said. “He used to sit on his phone and asked us for personal information to look us up on Facebook and stuff.” Sometimes, he said, Reyes entered detainees’ dorms late at night for no particular reason, and would take their used underwear and personal hygiene products. On other occasions, Renteria-Gonzalez alleged in the complaint, Reyes would stalk him as he went to and from the showers and ask invasive questions: “And after, he would say: ‘Tell me what were you doing in the shower?’” Twice, Renteria-Gonzalez said, Reyes came up behind him and touched him inappropriately. Another SLIPC officer, according to Renteria-Gonzalez, began to sexually harass him as well, sending him explicit notes and showing him pornographic images of herself. “I just felt overwhelmed,” he said. “I thought enough was enough.” Eventually, he realized he wasn’t alone. After being detained at SLIPC in February 2024, Garcia-Valenzuela said he also found himself trapped in Reyes’s unofficial work program. Mario Garcia-Valenzuela. Photograph: Mario Garcia-Valenzuela Garcia-Valenzuela had fled to the US in 2014 from Mexico, where he was tortured by members of a drug cartel. “I have no choice, that’s why I’m fighting,” he said. “Because I know that as soon as they deport me, I’m going to be handed over to the cartels and I’m going to be tortured and killed – ripped into pieces.” But in SLIPC he faced a new kind of horror. He alleged that on more than one occasion he was told to move heavy metal filing cabinets back and forth across a room. When he struggled to lift the furniture, Reyes would taunt him, he said, saying: “If you think you are a man, I’m going to treat you like a man.” In the spring of 2024, Garcia-Valenzuela reported sexual harassment on the basis of his gender, in accordance with Prea. He said he felt targeted due to his gender identity and wanted the fact he is transgender removed from his file, as a measure of protection. But an Ice officer responded that “even if we take off your transgender marker, there is no hiding that you are transgender”, noting Garcia-Valenzuela’s physical appearance, he said. To Garcia-Valenzuela’s knowledge, no follow-up investigation into Reyes was conducted. Renteria-Gonzalez’s complaints were dismissed as well, Renteria-Gonzalez said. A spokesperson for Geo categorically denied the allegations detailed in the complaints. “GEO strongly disagrees with these baseless allegations, which are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government’s immigration facility contractors,” said Christopher V Ferreira, a Geo group spokesperson. Ferreira added that “GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by standards and requirements established by the US Department of Homeland Security.” Geo did not respond to questions about Reyes’s employment status at SLIPC. Harsh retaliation The detainees who filed complaints against Reyes and other SLIPC staff said that they faced harsh retaliation for doing so. When Jane Doe filed a Prea complaint with Ice using a paper form and through the phone hotline, detailing that Reyes had sexually assaulted her, she received no response, according to her legal complaint. But afterwards, Reyes redoubled his efforts to stalk her, the complaint alleges – and forced her to perform oral sex on him, saying he had her cornered in the facility’s “camera blind spots” where no one would see them. When she attempted to resist, Reyes told her he had found her mother’s home address in the Dominican Republic, Doe alleges in the complaint, and told her that if she were deported, he would follow her to her family’s residence where “you won’t have any protection”. A spokesperson for Geo categorically denied the allegations detailed in the complaints. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images Jane Doe said Reyes and other staff also blocked her from accessing medical treatment for her epilepsy, even as her seizures became more severe and frequent during her time in detention, the complaint states. He repeatedly cornered Doe as she was en route to the medical center to receive treatment, and told her he would watch her on cameras while she was receiving medical evaluation. On one occasion, he told Doe he was “masturbating to her because he saw her body in medical condition when she was in an observation cell”, the complaint alleges. “We feel so vulnerable, impotent,” Renteria-Gonzalez said. After he reported that Reyes had sexually assaulted him, Renteria-Gonzalez said, Reyes burst into his housing unit and yelled, “You should have never put my name on it!”, in reference to the complaint to Ice. Renteria-Gonzalez said he was then placed in solitary confinement for two weeks. After Renteria-Gonzalez reported harassment from another officer, his complaint was dismissed as “unsubstantiated” and the officer came back and told him: “They can’t do nothing to me,” according to the complaint. Meanwhile, Garcia-Valenzuela said he was repeatedly sent to solitary confinement, he believes in retaliation for speaking out. He said staff at the detention center falsely reported that he had attempted self-harm, and needed to be placed under suicide watch, even though he had not in fact tried to hurt himself. At one point, while Garcia-Valenzuela was in the medical isolation unit, officers delivered him a meal that consisted of a few potatoes and a few grains of cereal. There was no spoon provided, he said, and there was a note that instructed him to eat it “like a dog”. Shortly after that incident, he said, a doctor at the facility suddenly – without explanation – stopped providing him access to medication for hand pain that had been exacerbated by his working in Reyes’s night-shift program. He has avoided making further complaints. He tries not to speak to or make eye contact with staff, and avoids leaving his dorm. He limits trips to the restroom, he said. And rather than go to the cafeteria to warm up his food and eat, he takes his meals cold, and dines in bed. “I have to stay in the back-most corner of my bed, and eat there,” he said. “I don’t ever feel at ease.” Trans people in federal custody under threat The allegations of abuse at SLIPC come at a time when the health and safety of trans people in federal custody is especially under threat, advocates say. On the first day of his presidency, Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of executive actions targeting trans rights, rolling back anti-discrimination protections and mandating that people in immigration detention be placed in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth. On 16 January – the last day of Joe Biden’s administration – Ice reported that 47 trans people were in Ice detention facilities around the country and that 69 had been arrested since the start of the fiscal year. As soon as Trump took office, the agency began omitting data on the number of transgender people in immigration detention from its reports. “The government is essentially refusing to acknowledge the existence of trans people, let alone their humanity,” Decker of RFK Human Rights said. Line chart showing the number of transgender detainees in immigration detention, with a gap during the Trump administration. The Trump administration stopped reporting those numbers Although a federal judge has blocked enforcement of Trump’s ban on transgender healthcare in federal prisons, Decker told the Guardian that inside detention centers, guards and staff have been emboldened to deny healthcare to trans clients, or retaliate against them for requesting care. “I worry that the situation will only get worse from here for trans people,” she added. The administration also closed the civil rights division of the DHS, as well as the ombudsman office overseeing immigration detention, arguing that the staff in these congressionally mandated divisions were “internal adversaries that slow down operations”. The divisions included employees tasked with regularly visiting detention centers, investigating complaints and preparing reports for Congress. Detainees facing discrimination, neglect and abuse now have even fewer options for recourse, Decker said. It’s a scary, difficult moment to speak out, said Campos-Flores, a 37-year-old single parent of two children who came to the US from El Salvador when they were 11 years old. During the seven months that Campos-Flores was detained at SLIPC, they would call their parents every day, just to reassure them that they were still alive. Periodically, they would beg their family and their lawyer to find ways to get them out. “I asked them to try to book me into another facility,” they said. “It was too much – just too much.” In November 2024, they were deported – and immediately they felt a sense of relief to be freed from Reyes, they said. But they couldn’t stay away from their children, who are US citizens – so they crossed back into the US and were again apprehended. They are currently detained at a different correctional facility in Louisiana, serving a criminal sentence for illegal re-entry. But after finishing their sentence, it is likely they will be transferred back to SLIPC before deportation – and face the same officers who harassed them, or ignored their complaints. “But I have my 12-year-old son. He is also gay, he likes boys, and I don’t want him to experience anything like what I have experienced,” they said. They want to fight for his rights, too, they said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/ice-immigration-queer-trans-louisiana,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75dc6d6703eba36902f2c71aa9ec4bdaf0fafd51/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7be42692766d60c0de090187a2cb7817",2025-10-16T16:56:19+00:00,d543dda4ebc33d2f7958b73464f72f6cbc1bf644
e1257b7b461f,"US marine resigns after 24 years, citing ‘concern for country’s future’ under Trump",,"A former US Marine Corps colonel and combat veteran has said that after 24 years of service he “resigned from the military because of Trump”, citing what he described as the US president’s contempt for the constitution. Doug Krugman left his role in the military on 30 September, coinciding with the day that Donald Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth delivered controversial , partisan addresses to US military leaders brought to a special meeting in Virginia from across the world, about military priorities and the administration’s agenda. “I gave up my career out of concern for our country’s future,” Krugman wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post on Thursday. He even warned of “collapse” of the conventional US government system. He quietly urged other military personnel to reflect on their own positions. “They should be confident in questioning possibly immoral or illegal orders,” he said, “remembering they are responsible for their own actions, and knowing others are asking the same questions.” “If they have doubts about their orders, they are not alone,” Krugman added. When Trump addressed the country’s highest-ranking military leaders on 30 September, he delivered a stern warning: “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.” Krugman, however, said he had already decided he was leaving the military and that was to be his final day. In the essay, he talks about how the 6 January 2021 riots first made his position in the military difficult, when extremist supporters of Trump were encouraged by the then outgoing president to stop the certification of his election loss to Joe Biden, and they broke into the US Capitol , chasing down lawmakers. But it was the subsequent pardoning of the insurrections when Trump returned to the White House in 2025, and also the administration’s refusal to grant refuge to many Afghans whom Krugman acknowledged had risked their lives for the US during the war in the region. That made him begin questioning Trump’s morality, he said. “Ignoring reality to take advantage of vague laws to assume emergency powers is also immoral,” Krugman wrote. “These are not the kinds of actions that I’m willing to risk my life to defend.” Krugman goes on to highlight how the federalized deployment of the national guard where they had not been requested crossed “legal limits” and that by declaring Portland, Oregon, for example, a war-zone, Trump’s words had “ little connection to reality ”. “Instead of trying to work within the Constitution, or to amend it, President Trump is testing how far he can ignore it,” he wrote. Krugman ended the essay with a warning. “If voters and legislators cannot close the gaps in our laws to clarify the limits of presidential power, those who serve our government will continue to struggle. The next president – of either party – may continue us down this path toward collapse,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/marine-resigns-trump-hegseth,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c3323c25270a990c82ef4b613908f383622a63/312_0_3116_2493/master/3116.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b38931ad16148f165e3899ace4a7b163",2025-10-16T16:44:51+00:00,e8d2abc2de32e2e585cf9cd8ad4bf928b1509f4c
7c58b2ed4521,Waving his flag all over the place: Trump adds ‘Arc de Trump’ to presidential renovations,,"More than two centuries have passed since France celebrated the emperor Napoleon’s birthday by laying the foundation stone of the Arc de Triomphe . Now Donald Trump has imperial ambitions of his own. On Wednesday, the US president unveiled plans for a grand arch in Washington that has already been dubbed the “ Arc de Trump ”. The project, likely to be seen by critics as evidence of monumental hubris, is the latest attempt by property developer-turned-politician Trump to transform the US capital for good . He told wealthy guests about the idea during a glitzy dinner in the White House East Room. The president pointed to a map displaying its proposed location as a gateway to Washington from northern Virginia. “Every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, something is supposed to be here,” he said. The location is overlooked by Arlington House, the former home of Robert E Lee, who led the army of northern Virginia on the Confederate side during the civil war. Various statues of Lee were removed after the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. But, Trump added: “That’s Arlington Memorial Bridge and, at the end of it, you have a circle that was built 150 years ago … In 1902, they were going to put a statue of Robert E Lee up, would have been OK with me – would’ve been on with a lot of the people in this room.” Trump picked up and showed off 3D models of the project in three sizes with a gold Lady Liberty statue on top. “Small, medium, large,” said Trump, eliciting laughter in the room. “I happen to like the large one. Why are you shocked?” Among the many differences between Trump’s first and second terms is his willingness to unleash his inner builder. Wednesday’s dinner was designed to thank billionaires and top companies for donating to another of his pet projects: a new $250m ballroom at the White House. He opened the curtains of the East Room to show guests where work has started on the giant ballroom, the biggest addition to the White House in more than a century. He said the building would have four walls of bulletproof glass and a capacity of 1,000 people, and would be able to host a presidential inauguration. The guests reportedly included representatives from tech firms such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Palantir and the defence giant Lockheed Martin, as well as twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of crypto platform Gemini. Trump told the gathering: “So many of you have been really, really generous. I mean, couple of you I have sitting here are saying: ‘Sir, would $25m be appropriate?’ I said: ‘I’ll take it.’ “So, we are going to have a phenomenal ballroom. It’s going to be one of the best anywhere in the world. There won’t be anything like it, actually. It’s four sides of beautiful glass. We will be able to have state dinners. We would literally not even have state dinners because it is not set up.” Trump has said the ballroom will be built entirely with private money. It includes $22m from a settlement with YouTube in September after the company suspended his account over the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. It is the biggest in a series of renovations Trump has made to the White House since returning to power in January, including erecting flagpoles, covering the Oval Office with gold decor (the New York Times called it a “ gilded rococo nightmare ”) and paving over the Rose Garden. Along the colonnade, he installed a “presidential walk of fame” with gold-framed pictures of every president except Joe Biden, who is replaced by an autopen. In recent days, he placed a statue of George Washington in the garden and a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln beside the Oval Office. According to the Axios news site , Trump has treated Benjamin Netanyahu and his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, to 40-minute tours of the White House renovations. He told guests on Wednesday: “It’s so relaxing for me. Real estate is relaxing. For a lot of people, real estate is a very trying business. I’ve always liked it. I’ve always done well with it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/donald-trump-washington-arch,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b71ad7c6baa478cfedf24d533444552778345e/237_0_4165_3333/master/4165.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2dc6b013a769c378c7047a7a06c62175",2025-10-16T16:42:15+00:00,504453a3180cda3b3791288d491ed04287be894e
4d942e1a4591,Head of IMF says risks in private credit market keep her awake at night,,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has admitted that worrying about the risks building up in non-bank lending markets keeps her awake at night. Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday urged countries to pay more attention to the private credit market, after the failure of the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor and the car parts supplier First Brands . Speaking at the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington DC, Georgieva said the fund was concerned about the “very significant shift of financing” from the banking sector to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Those NBFIs are not regulated as closely as the banking sector, she pointed out, meaning the world could end up in “a difficult place” if the private credit sector continued to grow significantly and the global economy then weakened. “This is why we are urging more attention to the non-bank financial institutions,” Georgieva told reporters, suggesting there should be more oversight of the sector. “You are asking the question that keeps me awake every so often at night.” First Brands and Tricolor had both been backed by private credit within the so-called shadow banking sector, which is not directly regulated and is not forced to disclose the level of risks on their books. On Tuesday, the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, warned that more “cockroaches” could emerge from the private credit industry . “My antenna goes up when things like that happen. I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. And so everyone should be forewarned at this point,” Dimon said. Georgieva said the IMF was being “very watchful”, but argued that “so far, not that many cockroaches” had been spotted. She said she was encouraged that countries across the globe had better policy frameworks than were in place before the global financial crisis of 2008, while “systemically significant economies” had accumulated massive reserves to cope with problems. But, she cautioned that many countries had exhausted their fiscal buffers, meaning they had little budget headroom to handle a financial crisis, while central banks were still battling inflation, and she urged vigilance over the non-bank sector. “In this environment, of course, the security blanket is covering us, but maybe we have a foot out in the cold. We have to be vigilant. What do we do? We watch it very carefully,” Georgieva said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back in June, BlackRock predicted that the private credit sector’s assets under management would grow to $4.5tn by 2030, up from an estimated $3tn today. BlackRock’s Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly said there was an “expanding addressable market” of investors and borrowers for private credit. “Indeed, private credit has evolved from an asset class that was best placed to accommodate niche financing solutions, or lending to smaller, middle-market borrowers, to a sizeable, scalable, stand-alone asset class,” they added. Earlier this week, the IMF warned that the growing exposure to NBFIs was generating concentration risk among some banks in the US and Europe. The fund is concerned that banks are increasingly lending to private credit funds because these loans often deliver higher returns on equity than traditional commercial and industrial lending, thanks to the lower capital requirements allowed by their collateral structure. It also warned US stock markets – which have rallied during the AI boom – were at risk of a “sudden, sharp correction” while government bond markets were under mounting pressure.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/head-of-imf-says-risks-in-non-bank-lending-keep-her-awake-at-night,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44ad485b1bb0d1a7c2c3097057dd802d2cc5d294/1001_277_3794_3035/master/3794.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc0aa6910675df84a1fe60dba2cc6792",2025-10-16T15:00:07+00:00,91b83aaacafe42eeb17bb8e9d542f716a79a4ebf
f41158c11a24,"‘When I was a child, everyone used it’: woman blames Johnson & Johnson talc for her cancer",,"I t was Sue Rizzello’s husband who persuaded her to see a doctor, concerned about the bloating in her abdomen that was making her more and more uncomfortable. Rizzello, then in her late 40s, had assumed it was menopausal weight gain, but agreed to go to her GP. “A smart locum said: ‘There’s something wrong here,’ and sent me for a blood test … And that saved my life.” It was the worst news: Rizzello had stage 3 ovarian cancer that had begun to spread. She would need to begin chemotherapy immediately and prepare for the complete removal of her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and omentum, a procedure that would put her into immediate menopause. It was the summer of 2012 and her husband, a chef, was working at one of the Olympic venues in Windsor, near to their then home in Slough. For Rizzello, however, “that whole summer was a blur” of painful treatment, including a clinical trial that was so tough, she was told, that many others had been unable to see it through. Six months later, the marketing consultant was told her cancer had gone. “But I was never the same. It was massive. It was an earth-shaking experience that really shook my confidence to the core.” Rizzello, now 60, was lucky, but she does not believe her cancer was just “one of those things” – she believes it was caused by talc. Johnson & Johnson continued to sell its talc products in the UK until 2023. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP She is one of about 3,000 British-based people – overwhelmingly women – who on Thursday brought a landmark legal action in the high court in London against the pharmaceuticals company Johnson & Johnson, claiming they or a family member contracted cancer after a lifetime using J&J’s baby powder. Backed by a specialist law firm, the claimants argue that the US-based multinational knew for decades that its talc products might contain dangerous asbestos but failed to warn consumers and carried on selling the products in the UK until 2023. J&J denies the allegations. A spokesperson for Kenvue, J&J’s former consumer health division that was spun off two years ago, said the talc used in baby powder complied with regulations, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer. Rizzello says she was in the dark about the origin of her disease, after genetic tests showed she did not carry the BRCA genes that significantly increase the risk of ovarian cancer. “And then I found out about the talc claims, and I thought, hang on.” “I’ve used talc all my life. I mean, when I was a child, everybody did,” she says, whether after swimming or after a bath. “It was just always there. It was just always something you use. I’m totally convinced this was the cause of my own illness, and all the nightmare of treatment and trials that followed.” J&J has been the subject of long-running lawsuits in the US over similar allegations of cancer links to talc, which it wholly disputes. Two years ago it spun off its consumer health division as Kenvue, which has responsibility for talc-related claims outside the US and Canada. Kenvue said: “We sympathise deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers – that’s why the facts are so important. The high-quality cosmetic-grade talc that was used in Johnson’s Baby Powder was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.” Two years ago, to mark the 10-year anniversary of being given the all clear, Rizzello asked friends to sponsor her to shave her hair again to raise money for cancer charities, in memory of others with the disease who did not survive. “I felt I really had to do something,” she says. “Many of the women I’ve met along the way had died, and so I always feel like it’s for them as much as it is for me. “I value some things much more highly than I did before. I think I’ve always dreaded the idea of getting older.

658bf2921386,Barrister found to have used AI to prepare for hearing after citing ‘fictitious’ cases,,"An immigration barrister was found by a judge to be using AI to do his work for a tribunal hearing after citing cases that were “entirely fictitious” or “wholly irrelevant”. Chowdhury Rahman was discovered using ChatGPT-like software to prepare his legal research, a tribunal heard. Rahman was found not only to have used AI to prepare his work, but “failed thereafter to undertake any proper checks on the accuracy”. The upper tribunal judge Mark Blundell said Rahman had even tried to hide the fact he had used AI and “wasted” the tribunal’s time. Blundell said he was considering reporting Rahman to the Bar Standards Board. The Guardian has contacted Rahman’s firm for comment. The matter came to light in the case of two Honduran sisters who claimed asylum on the basis that they were being targeted by a criminal gang in their home country. Rahman represented the sisters, aged 29 and 35. The case escalated to the upper tribunal. Blundell rejected Rahman’s arguments, adding that “nothing said by Mr Rahman orally or in writing establishes an error of law on the part of the judge and the appeal must be dismissed”. Then, in a rare ruling, Blundell went on to say in a postscript that there were “significant problems” within the grounds of appeal put before him. He said that 12 authorities were cited in the paperwork by Rahman, but when he came to read the grounds, he noticed that “some of those authorities did not exist and that others did not support the propositions of law for which they were cited in the grounds”. In his judgment, he listed 10 of these cases and set out “what was said by Mr Rahman about those actual or fictitious cases”. Blundell said: “Mr Rahman appeared to know nothing about any of the authorities he had cited in the grounds of appeal he had supposedly settled in July this year. He had apparently not intended to take me to any of those decisions in his submissions. “Some of the decisions did not exist. Not one decision supported the proposition of law set out in the grounds.” Blundell said the submissions made by Rahman – who said he had used “various websites” to conduct his research – were therefore misleading. Blundell said: “The most obvious explanation is … that the grounds of appeal were drafted in whole or in part by generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT. “I am bound to observe that one of the cases cited in Mr Rahman’s grounds … has recently been wrongly deployed by ChatGPT in support of similar arguments.” Rahman told the judge that the inaccuracies in the grounds were “as a result of his drafting style” and he accepted there might have been some “confusion and vagueness” in his submissions. Blundell said: “The problems which I have detailed above are not matters of drafting style. The authorities which were cited in the grounds either did not exist or did not support the grounds of which were advanced.” He added: “It is overwhelmingly likely, in my judgment, that Mr Rahman used generative artificial intelligence to formulate the grounds of appeal in this case, and that he attempted to hide that fact from me during the hearing. “Even if Mr Rahman thought, for whatever reason, that these cases did somehow support the arguments he wished to make, he cannot explain the entirely fictitious citations. “In my judgment, the only realistic possibility is that Mr Rahman relied significantly on Gen AI to formulate the grounds and sought to disguise that fact when the difficulties were explored with him at the hearing.” The judge’s ruling was made in September and published on Tuesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/16/barrister-found-to-have-used-ai-to-prepare-for-hearing-after-citing-fictitious-cases,Technology,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570d98206eb3576040ec72d4f196e09bc52dc624/243_0_2425_1941/master/2425.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff32dcefcf9bf1f60b4e9116a96cfca3",2025-10-16T13:47:04+00:00,6265fe6901fa092b9a9d1a31405ad8de5bdb05d2
7c1ebd43258c,Night owls versus early birds: who is superior according to science?,,"W e all know that early birds get the worm. But who wants a worm? Not me. For most of my life I have identified as a night owl , clambering out of bed as late as possible and not so much seizing but reluctantly easing into the day. US work culture is not really optimal for night owls. Rather, it favours CEOs who get up at 4am and run a marathon while the rest of us hit the snooze button. Still, I always consoled myself with the idea that night owls are actually more intelligent and creative than their early bird counterparts. Franz Kafka and Thomas Wolfe wrote at bedtime; Bob Dylan recorded at night. Even scientific studies indicated it was true . However, something weird has happened. Due to a combination of existential dread, cutting out alcohol and having a small child who wakes me up at an ungodly hour, I’ve started to go to bed earlier and earlier. These days, a 9pm bedtime is perfection. The idea of routinely staying up until the wee hours, as I used to, is now horrifying. This shift has me questioning everything. Is it actually possible for your body clock to change? Am I really turning into an early bird or have I just been forced into a child-dictated schedule? And if I am an early bird, does that make me a lesser being? I went on a mission to settle the owl-versus-lark debate for once and for all. What makes someone an early or late riser? My first discovery: you can’t help who you are; your optimal bedtime is hardwired into you. “We all have an internal biological clock, or a circadian rhythm, that controls numerous physiological outputs, including alertness levels, sleep, hormone levels and blood pressure,” says Kristen Knutson, an associate professor at Northwestern University who specializes in sleep research. Your “chronotype”, meanwhile, is your circadian preference: the scientific way of saying whether you’re a morning lark or night owl. Someone with an early chronotype will naturally find it easier to go to sleep early than someone with a later chronotype. While it is difficult to fundamentally change your chronotype, it does naturally shift as you age. Anyone with a small child will understand why I don’t bother with an alarm clock any more – my four-year-old rudely wakes me up at 5.30am instead. But biological clocks delay as puberty hits, says Knutson: teenagers “have a later chronotype. Then, as we get older, our chronotype tends to drift earlier and earlier. By the time we are in our 80s, we are an early type.” We all go through this same cycle, but from different starting points. “In young adults, morning and evening types can differ by as much as approximately four hours in how their biological clocks affect their behavior,” says Hans Van Dongen, director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University Health Sciences Spokane. It’s not entirely certain why these differences exist but, along with possible evolutionary reasons, there’s probably a genetic component. “Children born to evening-type parents are more likely to be evening types, and likewise for morning types,” says Van Dongen. Is there any evidence night owls are smarter than early birds? Back to that all-important question, though: does being a night owl make you more creative and intelligent? One 2007 study found “that evening-disposition is correlated with the ability to apply divergent thinking strategies to visual content” – a science-y way of saying “more creative”. In a 2009 study called “Why night owls are more intelligent”, psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa checked the bedtimes of 20,745 adolescents against the results of an intelligence test. He found people with higher intelligence were more likely to be night owls, and posited that it might be because it’s “evolutionarily novel” to stay up late. More recently , researchers at Imperial College London studied UK data on more than 26,000 people who had completed various intelligence tests. The 2024 paper found that those who stay up late had “superior cognitive function” to morning larks. Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ However, all the experts I spoke to were cautious about making definitive links between chronotype and traits like creativity, intelligence or sociability. While they make for good headlines, all of these studies have important limitations . That 2009 study, for example? Van Dongen notes the “analysis is based on how late individuals choose to go to bed … [and] cannot rule out the possibility that adolescents with higher IQ choose to study longer into the night and require more sleeping in for recovery on the weekend, or are involved in more or different after-school activities.” (I emailed Kanazawa, the study’s lead researcher and an academic at the London School of Economics, to get his take on this criticism and got a reply saying: “Yeah, like I’d speak to someone from the Guardian . ” It turns out that Kanazawa, who once claimed that a study showed black women to be less attractive than women of other races, is somewhat controversial and definitely not a Guardian fan.) So my beliefs about night owls were built on shaky ground. But the stereotypes of creative geniuses burning the midnight oil and early bird CEOs could still be relevant. “The timing of the biological clock determines more than just when people like to go to bed and get up and when they feel most alert during the day,” says Van Dongen. “It also determines in part the kinds of activities they may end up participating in and the experiences they get exposed to.” If you naturally get up early, it may be easier for you to thrive in a corporate work environment, for example. The dark side of being a night owl One thing sleep experts all seem to agree on is that trying to force a routine that is at odds with your biological clock is unhealthy. In fact, it could send you to an early grave. In 2018, Knutson, of Northwestern, co-authored a study that found night owls have a 10% higher risk of early death and more health problems compared with early risers. The study couldn’t determine the underlying reasons, but Knutson notes the issue may have something to do with “circadian disruption caused by desynchrony between their internal clock and the external world”. In other words, she says, “it is difficult for a night owl to live in a morning lark’s world”. skip past newsletter promotion Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 2024 study from Stanford Medicine researchers found that being up late is not good for your mental health, regardless of chronotype. The reasons are unclear, but researchers suspect it’s because unhealthy behaviours such as drinking alcohol or eating junk food are more likely late at night. Similarly, University of Groningen researcher Ana Wenzler worked on a recent study that found staying up late is linked to cognitive decline . Wenzler notes that at least 25% of the effect was because of lifestyle rather than anything intrinsic; again, you’re more likely to make poor choices late at night. Can you hack your chronotype? While you can’t change your chronotype, you can try to work in harmony with it. But to do that, you first have to understand which type you are, and it’s not always obvious. Looking back, I thought I was a night owl for many years just because of my habits. I was young and went out a lot. Yet once I stopped drinking, my body clock seemed to shift. But it’s not like I’m waking up with the birds like Snow White, ready for the day. In fact, I’ve started to think I’m neither a morning person nor an evening person, but something in the middle. Which, apparently, is possible. According to sleep specialist Dr Michael Breus, someone whose chronotype sits firmly in the middle is a “bear” . And us bears actually dominate: by some estimates , half the population is in that category. So how do you figure out your natural biological clock? Wenzler says the way to determine a person’s chronotype is to measure the melatonin levels in their saliva “throughout the day to see when the melatonin goes up”. Melatonin is a hormone your body secretes to signal to you that it’s night; morning people release it earlier. Obviously, saliva tests won’t be practical for most people. In the absence of a home science lab, says Wenzler, try sleeping without an alarm for a week. Stay away from depressants and stimulants like alcohol and coffee and avoid artificially extending your natural bedtime by doomscrolling or bingeing TV, and your body will find a natural rhythm. You’ll wake up whenever your body deems best. I would have tried this experiment myself, but you can’t really get rid of your alarm clock when that alarm is a small child. Finally, if you are certain you’re a night owl, but have to get up early for work (or, in my case, entertain a hyperactive four-year-old in the wee hours), can you tweak your biological clock? Sort of! “It’s possible to shift, but usually only modestly,” says Matthew P Walker, director at the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Walker mentions a 2019 study that “advanced night owls by about two hours in three weeks using structured routines: morning light, fixed mealtimes, earlier exercise and caffeine cutoff. People reported better mood and performance in the mornings, though most drift back if the changes aren’t maintained. “One could not imagine anyone sticking to this regimen in perpetuity,” he adds, and these findings indicate that people should operate in tune with their chronotype, not against it. “Yes – the early bird may catch the worm.

Gio is now being stretchered off. Portales comes on in her place. Share Updated at 13.30 EDT 39 min: Gio is still down and receiving treatment. Her face is covered by her hands. Meanwhile, the referee has now been sent to the screen. Is this going to be changed to a red card?! 37 min: Gio almost gets past Janssen and the latter sticks out a leg out to prevent her from coming across. The United defender gets a yellow and the hosts have a free-kick in a dangerous area on the right side of the box. 34 min: How is it not 2-0?! Malard and Zigiotti Olme link up for a quick give-and-go. The former, right in front of goal, tries to hit it with the outside of her boot and the ball dribbles just wide. So close! 33 min: The referee blows her whistle after Medina tries to jump for the ball and falls on Riviere in the process. It has been an intriguing battle between the two so far. 28 min: It is a deserved lead for United, who have had four attempts on goal compared with Atlético’s one despite having less of the ball. They have found their rhythm and their tactic of pressing and crowding the opposition box has worked well so far. GOAL! Atlético Madrid 0-1 Manchester United (Rolfö 24) It has been coming! From the right Zigiotti Olme’s curls it in and Toone attempt to head it down. It falls to Rolfö invitingly and from the volley, she hammers it into the roof of the net to score her first goal for Manchester United.

Atlético in their traditional red and white tops with blue shorts while United don their all-black third kit. Some pre-match post bag from all of you. Marc (Skinner?) sends his prediction: United have been a lot of fun to watch this season, in my very biased opinion. I have been so pleased with our defensive structure. Tonight is probably our biggest challenge though. Up the reds! And Amy checks in from Madrid: I am at the Centro Deportivo Wanda Alcalá de Henares (what a mouthful) as a neutral – tickets were quite affordable – and it might be a small stadium but the Spanish fans I have seen are loud! Hopefully they keep up the tempo throughout the 90. Here is what Marc Skinner had to say in yesterday’s pre-match press conference. We’re excited. We’re looking forward to playing Atléti, fantastic team, fantastic club. We’re really looking forward to it. We know how good we are, we believe in ourselves, we also know we’re facing a really tough challenge. Tomorrow night will be a really good challenge for us – everyone is raring to go. [Atlético Madrid] have an incredible attack. They have flair, they have aggression, they are very evasive. They have got Vilde Bøe Risa, who used to play for Manchester United and is a wonderful footballer. They defend very well as well, so they have quite a good balance. I think we have to defend well tomorrow night because of the threats they have. Also, with the ball, I think they have to be aware of us. We’ve spoken about it, we have to be focused and defensively alert because Atléti can spring counterattacks quickly and have the ability to beat you one v one. Also, in front of their fans, I think it will be a good atmosphere. We see a lot threats, but also hopefully we can give them our threats too. Tonight’s broadcast of Atlético Madrid v Manchester United is available to watch on Disney+ after they acquired rights across multiple European territories. Tom Garry’s verdict? An intriguing collaboration but room for growth. Chelsea were in WCL action last night, cruising to a 4-0 win against Paris FC. Sophie Downey was at the Bridge to watch it unfold. Their pressure eventually told, however, when Nüsken went down in the box with half an hour played. The offence from Le Moguédec was not initially spotted by the referee, Michalina Diakow, but after a brief trip to the VAR monitor, she duly pointed to the spot. Baltimore stepped up to convert for the second week in a row. Chelsea consolidated their advantage just before the break when Thompson broke forward at pace. A clever turn gave her space to stand up a cross for Rytting Kaneryd to loop a header home. The winger looked slightly bemused that it had ended up in the back of the net, celebrating with an expression that said she is not accustomed to scoring with her head. Read the full report below.

Last Wednesday Marc Skinner’s side made their debut in the Women’s Champions League after qualifying for the main phase of the tournament for the first time in their history. It was not particularly thrilling but a Maya Le Tissier penalty was enough for the hosts to earn the win against Vålerenga .

77daeeb88380,Mohammed Ben Sulayem set to remain FIA president after Mayer denied by arcane rule,,"Mohammed Ben Sulayem will stand unopposed for another term as the president of the FIA, motor sport’s governing body, with the last remaining candidate due to pull out on Friday because of an arcane election rule. Tim Mayer, a former FIA senior steward with 15 years in the role until he was sacked last November , was one of three candidates who had announced they would oppose Ben Sulayem, alongside the former racing driver Laura Villars and the Belgian journalist Virginie Philpott. None of them, however, are able to meet the FIA requirements for the election process. Mayer is expected to formally announce the end of his campaign in Austin on Friday , the Guardian understands, where he will make clear the reasons behind it and his assessment of the current electoral process. The regulation in question requires any presidential candidate to submit six prospective vice-presidents, one from each of the FIA’s global regions. Extraordinarily, the person who has unwittingly found themselves at the heart of the issue is the former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone’s wife, the Brazilian Fabiana Ecclestone, who is the only world council representative for South America and has already declared for Ben Sulayem. With no other representatives from South America, candidates cannot name a potential vice-president for the region and are thus ineligible to stand, leaving Ben Sulayem unopposed in December’s election. It is believed Mayer will nonetheless continue to campaign in order to demonstrate that he would have been a credible alternative. The FIA said in a statement: “The FIA presidential election is a structured and democratic process, to ensure fairness and integrity at every stage. Prospective candidates have had since the publication of the detailed information on 13 June to prepare their applications.” Recently Ben Sulayem has come under increased criticism surrounding the issue of governance of the FIA, including accusations of a concentration of power in his hands and that of the senate and in limiting the efficacy of the ethics committee that would allow enquiries to be suppressed by the president. David Richards, the chair of Motorsport UK, noted he had “concerns about the erosion of accountability and good governance within the FIA”. While the former deputy president for sport Robert Reid, who resigned in April, cited his unhappiness with “critical decisions being made without due process” and a “fundamental breakdown in governance standards”.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/mohammed-ben-sulayem-set-to-remain-fia-president-after-tim-mayer-fails-to-meet-requirements,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a27017cc3542c7f5dc7174c87b81510525d8f1/111_0_3966_3173/master/3966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e42b33adc89e940a649953eb16a4d264",2025-10-16T15:42:49+00:00,9d870529b56fe16bf5ae2bacde16721b29c2ed95
cc4f5c2b1428,Nick Woltemade was a risky signing but is already central to new-look Newcastle,,"W hen Alexander Isak sealed his £125m British record transfer to Liverpool , Newcastle fans braced themselves for a period of turbulence. Losing their talismanic striker, who scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances, felt like a decisive blow – until a 6ft6in German forward began to quietly win them over. Replacing a centre-forward is not as simple as matching goals with goals. Newcastle’s task was to replace a player ​around who​m the team’s attacking identity had been built? The answer was 23-year-old Nick Woltemade, a young, promising forward from VFB Stuttgart but untested at the very top level. Newcastle were linked with a series of strikers in the summer. Benjamin Sesko’s explosive speed and ability to exploit high defensive lines seemed like a natural replacement for Isak, but he had his heart set on Manchester United . Hugo Ekitike offered silky dribbling and flair akin to Isak’s technical ability, but he chose league champions Liverpool . Viktor Gyökeres could not stop scoring for Sporting but he ended up at Arsenal . Woltemade looked like a compromise, a punt on potential rather than a direct heir to Isak. The club record £69m price tag looked hefty, particularly for a player who had been playing for SV Elversberg in Germany’s third tier two years earlier. Even Newcastle legend Alan Shearer was unsure, warning in early September: “He’s probably had maybe seven or eight months of good football … it’s a big, big ask for him to go in and lead the line as Newcastle’s No 9.” His goal-per-game rate – 0.2 in the Bundesliga – hardly compared to Isak’s rate of 0.63 per game in the Premier League and Woltemade’s style made him a curious choice. Whereas Isak thrives as a technical, poaching No 9, Woltemade’s game revolves around link-up play, dropping deep and facilitating others. For a club that had spent the last three seasons building its shape around a different style of attacker, this was a tactical gamble as much as a financial one. But what looked like a compromise is showing early signs of being the right solution Newcastle. It took the towering forward just 29 minutes to win over the sceptical fans at St James’ Park on debut, rising above Emmanuel Agbadou after some smart movement to head home the winner against Wolves . He backed up that effort with three more goals, taking his tally to four in six Premier League and Champions League appearances. Just like that, the Isak hangover was gone, the noise of a summer of turmoil was drowned out by the chants from the Toon Army. Nick Woltemade scored his first goal and the winner for Germany this week against Northern Ireland. Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Though his goals have been a welcome addition to a side that has started the season with the fifth fewest goals in the Premier League (six), Woltemade’s real impact lies in how he is transforming Newcastle’s attacking approach. He offers the team a new dimension to their traditionally direct style of attacking. The German blends the physical presence of the traditional No 9 with the technical qualities of a deep-lying playmaker. Unlike Isak, who thrived on stretching defences and getting in behind the last line of defence, Woltemade prefers to play between the lines, dropping into midfield zones to link play and help his team progress play. He gives his side another route out of a high press rather than a long ball and drags defenders out of position in tight areas, which in turn gives Newcastle greater positional fluidity as as Anthony Gordon, Anthony Elanga and Jacob Murphy now push higher and narrower from the wing, using Woltemade’s movement to find gaps behind defenders. Newcastle still transition quickly - they have taken the third fewest touches in their own penalty area and the least touches in their own defensive third, while advancing the ball toward the opponent’s goal during a sequence of play at the third fastest rate in the league. But, where there was once an emphasis on pace and movement in behind the last line of defence to exploit Isak’s finishing ability, there is now more controlled possession, using Woltemade’s link-up play to build attacks rather than relying solely on transitions. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The front line is still finding its rhythm. His movement patterns are not yet fully understood by his teammates and the fluid attacking triangles that once thrived between Lewis Hall, Joelinton and Gordon have been disrupted as roles have shifted. The team is still learning how to make the most of his hold-up play and his ability to link midfield to attack, with a tendency to be overly direct at times. Replacing Isak was never going to be simple, and Eddie Howe is still ironing out some kinks, but Woltemade’s influence on Newcastle’s attack is already clear.

1f10c3403634,‘My name is Manchester United’: the superfan who fought to change his identity,,"A sk any Manchester United fan of a certain age what 26 May 1999 means to them, and they will tell you the date has marked them for life. It was the night injury-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær sealed United’s 2-1 comeback in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou. It was also the night the life of one United fan in Bulgaria, who has died this week at the age of 62, changed for ever. That supporter was born Marin Zdravkov Levidzhov in Svishtov, a town on the Danube with a population of 22,000. Growing up in communist Bulgaria adoring football, he dreamed of changing his name to … Manchester United . To claim the name of a football club from the capitalist west, however, was mission impossible. Had Marin tried to do so before the fall of the regime, he would almost certainly have ended up in jail. Ten years after the end of communism in Bulgaria – on that night in May 1999 – Marin’s idiosyncratic dream edged closer to reality. Watching the final from his modest home in Svishtov and with United trailing, Marin made a promise to himself: if United somehow turned the game around, he would do anything to change his name to that of the club he loved. Then the impossible happened. Marin fulfils his dream of visiting Old Trafford. Photograph: Family handout The next day, Marin visited a lawyer expressing his unusual request and so began a long, hard battle. Marin’s father, from whom he had inherited his love of United, was long gone and the 36-year-old was living with his mother, working all kinds of odd jobs, including as a construction worker on £15 a day. He was hardly making ends meet, yet his dream became an obsession. He quickly turned into the talk of the town, then became an international sensation, but 15 years full of legal battles and disheartening court decisions lay ahead. Marin’s wish was rejected initially for copyright reasons: he could not change his name to a trademark known around the globe. Then a local judge ruled partially in his favour, saying Marin could change his first name to Manchester but that he was not to use United as his official surname. “But I don’t want to be named after a city in England, I want to wear the name of my favourite football club,” Marin told the court. The struggle continued. When not in court, he was often looking after his cats. He had plenty of them in his back yard in Svishtov and loved them as much as the Red Devils. He named them all after United players: from Rio to Rooney, they were the most famous cats in town. Which was the favourite cat of Man U (as his close friends called him)? A kitty called Beckham. Marin bedecked in United gear. Photograph: Family handout Marin managed another breakthrough in court: he was allowed to add United as an official nickname to his ID card. But still he wasn’t happy. “I won’t stop until my full name is Manchester United,” he vowed. His story soon led to commercial propositions – an offer to have fan merchandise produced under his new name – but despite his financial struggles, he rejected the opportunity because he did not want to profit from his favourite club. The Manchester United name was sacred to him. A documentary followed in 2011. The crew turned Marin’s dream of visiting Old Trafford into reality and there he even met Dimitar Berbatov, the Bulgaria striker playing for United at the time. Marin tattooed the United crest on his forehead three years later as a protest against the court decisions and in his last few years it became more and more difficult for him to continue his legal battle.

853159b4f6e8,‘It’ll Never Go Away’: Three Jeffrey Epsteins on What It’s Like to Live With Their Notorious Name,,"Jeffrey Epstein needs no introduction. After years of media coverage and wild conspiracy theories, the late financier is practically synonymous with human trafficking and sexual abuse. He was a real-life boogeyman who spent years preying on underage girls while being shielded from prosecution by his immense wealth and powerful connections. This made him into an enduring symbol of moral rot among American elites, not to mention a lack of justice for victims of sexual violence. Still, the Epstein saga might have gradually faded from the national consciousness, even in spite of the widespread, unfounded belief that his 2019 suicide in a jail cell while awaiting trial was in fact a murder carried out to prevent him from implicating associates in his crimes. But, because one of his longtime friends was Donald Trump — the two were close until a falling out sometime around the mid-2000s — Epstein’s ghost has continued to haunt the political landscape. It’s not just that things like a creepy birthday letter the president allegedly wrote to him have become a matter of public record (though Trump denies authoring the document); there’s also the administration’s embarrassing, ongoing failure to disclose more material related to federal investigations of Epstein after many assurances to the MAGA base that they would release these supposed bombshell files. And so “Jeffrey Epstein” is a name that still commands headlines. It also happens to be a fairly common name, in use among a great many men who have done no wrong. One database search returned information on nearly 300 Jeffrey Epsteins around the U.S. Rolling Stone reached out to dozens of them in hopes of learning how the Epstein story has affected their day-to-day lives over the past few years. Perhaps understandably, only three replied to share their experiences. The Singer Jeff L. Epstein, 53, resides in an area of New Jersey outside Philadelphia and works full-time as a singer covering Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and many others, in senior living centers, where he says residents are thankfully not too plugged into news developments involving the other Jeffrey Epstein. (He also says that only his older relatives call him Jeffrey.) When the topic does come up, he’s taken to feigning confusion, acting as if he doesn’t follow the news himself. “Every now and then some resident, like 80 years old, might say, ‘Will you ever release the tapes?'” Epstein says. “And I’m like, ‘Yeah, I don’t know what you’re talking about — what are you referring to?” This strategy, he says, tends to shut down the conversation quickly and effectively. It irks him that the case seems to be a joke to people who make these comments. “If you treat the subject seriously, there is never a reason to say that to me, ever,” he says. This Epstein first learned of the infamous Epstein in the mid-2010s. With the latter’s arrest and suicide in 2019, he recalls, things turned “nightmarish,” particularly online. He shares a screenshot of a Facebook post he made that year in a local community group where he asked for recommendations of a cleaning service, only to be met by hostile and mocking comments addressing him as Epstein the criminal, as well as a photo of that Epstein. Elsewhere on social media, people have demanded to know why his username is “Jeff Epstein,” assuming it’s an intentional provocation. In some instances, he has tried to roll with the unfortunate coincidence, like when he occasionally made appearances on the YouTube show of comedian Graham Elwood, who would introduce him by saying, “No, not that one!” Epstein acknowledges that the bit “was pretty funny.” More recently, though, Epstein says, he is trying to reclaim his name. At a weekly open mic with musician friends where he’s been a regular for two years, he says, he used to call himself “Jeff L.” to avoid any unwanted association with a notorious sex offender. Then he had a change of heart. “It just doesn’t feel right,” he says. “It’s just awkward. So maybe six months ago, I’m like, ‘I’m done. My name is Jeff Epstein.'” He told the open mic host to introduce him by his full name going forward. Initially, the host started telling audiences that he was “the good one, not the bad one,” Epstein says, but he soon put a stop to that, telling him that “the only reason” he still deals with a certain stigma is because “people keep saying that.” “It’ll never go away,” he reflects, in part because of the other Epstein’s many links to rich and powerful people, but also since “we’ll never know the total truth” of what went on in his social circles. “So people are going to make up whatever, and just keep it going,” Epstein says. The Warehouse Manager Asked whether the name has caused him much grief, another Jeff Epstein, a 45-year-old warehouse manager in New Jersey, says, “You have no idea!” His friends, at least, appear take a certain pleasure in the unfortunate coincidence. Epstein shares an email thread between him and a few pals about being approached for this interview — one person advises that he tell Rolling Stone “that you haven’t been laid in six years because of this, and make sure they put your picture and address in the article.” “I went to my primary care doctor, whom I haven’t seen in years,” Epstein says. “He walks in and says, ‘Back in the news!’ I can’t make this shit up.” He admits that the remarks are pretty much inescapable. “I get comments all the time, especially when I need to show ID,” he says. Epstein knows how to take these interactions in stride, however. “I usually tell them they are uninvited to my yacht party if they tell me to change my name.” The Flooring Company Owner Then there’s Jeff Epstein, 57, who runs a flooring company in Tuscon, Arizona — and says that his name has thankfully never put a dent in his business. “My customers get a kick out of it,” he says. “When they don’t know my full name, and I call them, because of my iPhone, it says Jeffrey Epstein is calling. And so I’ve had customers block my phone immediately, then I have my office call and tell them, ‘No, no, that’s Jeff.'” “It comes in waves,” Epstein says of conversations about being a Jeffrey Epstein. “Sometimes I don’t get anything for months at a time, and then some weeks, I’ll have three or four people mention it,” with some asking if it’s his real name. He adds, “It can be annoying, but it has never been negative, other than the inconvenience. It’s just never-ending. It’s funny, if the news is on when I walk in, I’ll hear my name three or four times in two minutes. There’s always something that reminds me every day that I share a name with this guy.” Epstein says the unusual situation has affected the rest of his family, too. While his company doesn’t make use of his surname, his brother has a business that does, which has led customers to make jokes. His brother tells them that he has a sibling named Jeffrey who has to put up with much more of this commentary. “I’m non-political, so that also helps,” Epstein says of his random connection to reviled criminal frequently invoked in partisan attacks. Even so, he has a clear personal interest in seeing the Epstein case come to some kind of resolution. “I did post ‘release the Epstein files,’ but that’s basically because I want my name back,” he says. “Yeah, let’s get it over with. Why are we not doing this?” He’s referring to the current administration’s attempts to move on from the matter, with Trump and the White House taking the bizarre, nonsensical line that lingering questions about the late Epstein’s activities constitute some kind of “ hoax ” from Democrats. “You mean my name was ruined because of… nothing?” “Would definitely love to have no one talking about my name anymore,” he continues. Although they’ve each found ways to deal with the headache, these Jeffrey Epsteins agree that it’s a tired subject. At this point, they’ve all heard the same lines thousands of times. “It’s run its course, but just won’t go away,” Epstein says. If you ever meet a Jeffrey Epstein, then, do him a solid: pretend you’ve never heard the name in your life.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jeffrey-epstein-infamous-name-1235446383,Entertainment,the guardians,Miles Klee,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jeffrey-epstein-same-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900,2025-10-16T14:20:57+00:00,081027376823596f500078a90b4f80548679ef14
93ceef048ff3,‘We want to use this as a launchpad’: can A24 also conquer the world of theater?,,"O n a recent Saturday night in downtown Manhattan, a sold-out crowd at the Cherry Lane Theatre delighted in one of the most bizarre sights in recent New York stage memory: comedian Natalie Palamides, dressed as if in split screen – her left side bedecked in Y2K girl signifiers (butterfly clips, low-rise jeans), her right in bro clothes (cargo pants, flannel) – barreling across the stage and tangling with … herself. In her one-woman show Weer, the Los Angeles-based clown plays two halves of a toxic relationship over three late-90s years, flipping between perspectives with the velocity of a spinning top. The show is difficult to describe and perhaps more difficult to market, as well as gloriously unhinged and riotously funny – a bold gambit for a performer, as well as for the new Cherry Lane, the West Village staple recently renovated and reopened by A24 . The film distribution company turned production studio turned cultural lodestar purchased the historic theater, billed as the “birthplace of Off-Broadway”, for $10m in 2023, as part of its expansion beyond the cultish, acclaimed arthouse films – Moonlight, Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All at Once, to name a few – that built their hip reputation for the cool and cutting edge. (Or, as some would argue, a certain loose but identifiable aesthetic – neon-drenched palette, buzzy cast, faces that have seen an iPhone – and provocative bent.) Following an interior overhaul – including new lighting and sound systems, redone upholstery, a screen and curtains for “cinema mode” and a restaurant ( Wild Cherry ) from hot Manhattan restaurant group Frenchette – Cherry Lane is reopened for business and aiming to attract high-minded, zeitgeist-oriented New Yorkers, whether or not they own an A24 hat . Photograph: A24 “We want to become a live destination where anyone can stop by on any given night and see something engaging and interesting,” said Dani Rait, Cherry Lane’s programming director. Rait’s vision for Cherry Lane is partly informed by a decade of booking talent and musical guests for Saturday Night Live , scanning for the au courant and adaptable. “We want to capture the culture of the moment and be all-encompassing,” spanning film screening, musical performance, conversations, live theater and more for “an overarching body of work” in New York. After a soft opening this summer that included acoustic shows by Haim and standup gigs by Ramy Youssef and Alex Edelman , Cherry Lane officially opened in September with a lineup of events indicating the space’s flexibility and limited-edition appeal: a live reading of True West featuring Michael Shannon; a screening of 25th Hour and Q&A with Spike Lee; a night of comedy with Jerrod Carmichael; a Sunday film series hosted by Sofia Coppola. And Weer , which became the new Cherry Lane’s first long-term booking after Rait caught a performance at last year’s Edinburgh fringe festival. With diabolical physical gags and a thrilling mix of belly laughs and pathos, the show builds on A24’s longstanding reputation for trusting the market appeal of challenging work, as well as for anointing emerging artists. (See: Aftersun, Lady Bird, Eighth Grade and Midsommar.) Palamides is “the most fearless performer I’ve ever seen”, said Rait. “You can’t experience Weer in any other medium besides the live space. It really is setting the tone for the type of work we want to do here.” Intimate, strange and tightly contained, it also plays in contrast to the sprawl of A24, which has rapidly ballooned from indie kingmaker to all-encompassing brand. In recent years, the company, founded in 2012 as an arthouse distributor, has widened its ambition from producing and marketing taste-making films to all-encompassing world – A24 as a signifier of something adult-oriented, polished, discerning. It moved into television, formed a membership program , backed a beauty brand , sold merch, and partnered with a talent management company . Natalie Palamides outside the Cherry Lane Theatre. Photograph: A24 The infusion of more private equity capital – Jared Kushner’s Thrive Capital led its latest seed round for a valuation of $3.5bn, a 40% increase over its prior funding in 2022 – brought a mandate for more growth, reflected in a slate of commercially ambitious films with increasingly lavish budgets and mixed reviews. Some bets have paid off, such as Alex Garland’s Civil War ($127.3m box office last year, on $50m budget) and the Celine Song’s Materialists ($103m haul this summer, on a $20m budget). Others, such as Ari Aster’s Eddington and Death of a Unicorn , have struggled to connect with audiences. Earlier this month, The Smashing Machine , a wrestling epic from Benny Safdie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson , bombed spectacularly, with just over $5m on opening weekend, the lowest haul of Johnson’s career. (It did have the misfortune of going up against Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl “movie” .) In December, the company will premiere Josh Safdie’s Marty Supreme, reportedly A24’s most expensive movie yet with a budget of about $60m. Cherry Lane, with a staff of 30 and 167-seat capacity, represents a nimbler corner of a company, in touch with its experimental roots and able to pivot according to audience demand and interest. Programming will be ad hoc and regular-ish; Weer remains its only long-term booking. The company is not requiring performers or material to have any tie to A24 , nor are there any plans to develop original theater. But both remain a possibility. “We want to use this as a launchpad for emerging voices and talent that maybe don’t have a TV show yet or a film deal yet but have a story to tell,” said Rait. “We just want to give them a stage to tell it on.” The redesign of Cherry Lane, and A24’s move into live events, comes during a period of significant commercial investment in off-Broadway theaters long run by non-profits, as well as concern over the accessibility of theater in New York. The Amazon subsidiary Audible has partnered with the Minetta Lane Theatre since 2018; the Greenwich Village playhouse became the launchpad for Together , a collective effort by Hugh Jackman, super-producer Sonia Friedman and director Ian Rickson to counteract Broadway’s ballooning ticket prices with intimate, affordable theater. (A quarter of tickets at its two initial shows were comped to various community groups, and another quarter sold at the box office for $35). The Cherry Lane Theater is now a for-profit entity, though A24 is preserving some of its non-profit programs, including one for playwright mentoring. Though it has no set policy for ticket prices yet, Rait said the theater was “always thinking about accessibility with tickets. It’s really important to us to keep prices low enough for all different types of people to come see our shows.” (For each performance, Weer has a dedicated allotment of rush tickets sold an hour before showtime for $24 each.) The emphasis on the buzzy and the boundary-pushing seems to be working – this week, after a sold-out run, Cherry Lane announced a second extension for Weer through 21 December. Word of mouth has been strong, in line with the theater’s goal to be, as Rait put it, a “reflection of what culture is talking about today” in a physical space. “This intimate setting, with a bunch of people trying to have fun, is the best way to experience Weer,” said Rait. “And that really is what we’re trying to build here – once in a lifetime opportunities to come see something in the flesh.”",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/16/a24-cherry-lane-theatre-new-york,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de0be484c0c8465354612ae0f2ef6fdff7e183e5/0_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a5558c0821b401228468bcbd9e372b2",2025-10-16T15:41:30+00:00,1719e492f420ad541da471894784c725dd7e3f24
29f611624590,Jimmy Kimmel: ‘Trump’s inner circle knows how dangerous the incessant misinformation from Fox News can be’,,"Late-night hosts recapped the many vile leaked messages from a Young Republicans group chat and Donald Trump ’s ongoing Fox News-fueled delusions. Jimmy Kimmel “It’s hard to imagine, but one day this avalanche of insanity we get buried under, each day deeper and deeper than the next, will one day be taught in history books in every place other than Florida,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday evening. “What a stupid time to be alive.” To wit, Kimmel cited a Daily Beast report that Trump’s inner circle has become “alarmed” by the impact of Fox News on his decision-making. “Trump officials became concerned when Trump asked if he could get a reverse mortgage on the White House and one of those Terry Bradshaw walk-in tubs,” Kimmel joked. The report noted that Trump probably sent the national guard to Portland, Oregon, based on footage he saw on Fox News of the Black Lives Matter protests from summer 2020, mistaking them for current unrest. “He still might think that’s happening in real time,” said Kimmel. “He’s on a five-year delay from the rest of us. “Trump’s inner circle knows just how dangerous the incessant misinformation from Fox News can be, because they all worked there 10 months ago,” he continued. “It is frightening to know that the president of the United States is being briefed on world events by the same source as everyone at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport Chili’s To-Go.” But “one thing you can say about Donald Trump though: he has a vivid imagination,” he said. “He has created a dangerous organization to get the old people excited and fired up, a supervillain called antifa. And the reason we know that antifa is organized against the government is because their matching signs indicate that they are somehow in league with Kinko’s, or something.” On Fox News, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, falsely claimed “thousands” of protesters had signs that were “pre-bought, pre-put together – they’re organized, and someone is funding them”. She also threatened: “We’re going to get to the funding of antifa, we’re going to get to root of antifa, and we are going to find and charge all of those people who are causing this chaos in Portland and all these other cities across our country.” “And if we can’t find them, we’re going to pretend that we did,” Kimmel added. Kimmel made one thing clear: “There’s no chaos in Portland. None. There’s no chaos in Chicago. There was no chaos in Los Angeles. They’re pretending there’s chaos as pretense for a military takeover.” And he once again asked for viewers to submit videos of non-chaos in these cities under the hashtag #showmeyourhellhole – “and maybe you too can help educate our president on what is happening in the country that he runs.” Stephen Colbert Nine months into the second Trump presidency, “it feels like we’re about to give birth to an unvaccinated porcupine,” Stephen Colbert joked on the Late Show. “Every day, he finds disturbing new ways to undermine our norms.” And on Wednesday, the Republican National Committee chair, Joe Gruters, revealed that Trump prefers to combine his McDonald’s hamburger and filet-o-fish entrees. “I can’t help but feel for everyone who has to fly with the president,” said Colbert. “Imagine being stuck on a 12-hour flight with an old man hot-boxing you with filet-o-farts.” “That’s the light part of tonight’s monologue,” he added. Because this week, Politico published a report based on thousands of private messages between leaders of the Young Republicans organization full of offensive rhetoric. “OK, look, I know politics can be rough and tumble, but how offensive could these texts be?” said Colbert. “It’s not like they wrote ‘I like Hitler.’” In fact, someone did write “I love Hitler.” “That is a tough one to spin,” Colbert joked, mocking the chat – “What? I was talking about Pete Hitler and his honky tonk bluegrass band. You’re telling me there’s another Hitler?” In 2,900 pages worth of texts, the Young Republicans sent each other an array of slurs, joked about enslavement and made disparaging comments about Jewish people, women, Black people and other minorities. One also texted: “If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr [for real].” JD Vance, naturally, downplayed the language, dismissing the report as “kids do stupid things, especially young boys”. However, the group’s minimum age requirement is 18, and some members of the chat were up to 40 years old. “Cause nothing says young like getting your first routine colonoscopy,” Colbert quipped.",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/16/jimmy-kimmel-trump-fox-news-young-republicans,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf1f0bddbd15984cb28325a21fef28a8bfbe751/357_88_1962_1569/master/1962.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa1577541f6579751b2e3d86138eedde",2025-10-16T15:15:17+00:00,48ce4295930d1123487f09292cbb01ff5a0efc48
5f8703838c58,"Pop-rock wizard Todd Rundgren: ‘When I met John Lennon, he was a bundle of rags with nothing to say’",,"I Saw the Light is extraordinarily brilliant. How did you write it? Eamonmcc I was still learning about songwriting and by the time I got to Something/Anything? [1972, featuring I Saw the Light] I was slipping into formula – verse, chorus, bridge and so on, always about the girl or boy who broke your heart. I moved my hands about the keyboard and 20 minutes later that song was done. It’s partly why I went completely off the grid for my next album, A Wizard, a True Star [1973] – because I realised I couldn’t keep cranking out songs in 20 minutes about that one relationship in high school. The prettiest girl in school had suddenly taken a shine to me – I think because I had long hair, which was also the reason her dad made her break up with me, which messed me up pretty bad. Wikipedia says A Wizard, a True Star was “heavily informed by Rundgren’s hallucinogenic experiences”. Were you actually taking LSD? mjhmjh I didn’t smoke or drink anything until my first album [Runt, in 1970]. In my first band they’d smoke pot and the rehearsal would turn into a 30-minute giggling session. Then, when I was 21 I was living in [rhythm section] the Sales brothers’ house and their mom said “I can’t believe you’ve never had a drink” and got me drunk. Then my best friend who was studying to be a psychiatrist suggested I try psychoactives. I trusted him implicitly, so I did. I was taking drugs occasionally throughout the building of the studio. Not when we were doing the music – I had to run the sessions – but I remember lying on my back as high as a kite trying to do the wiring. Through psychoactives I discovered there was more going on in my head than that high school relationship. In your book The Individualist you said that when you were travelling around you wrote a song but didn’t have a recorder, so kept replaying it in your head until you got back to the States. Which song was it? JanetDM I believe it was Lost Horizon. I was in a little hotel room in Kathmandu and a song started going round in my head. The only way I could remember it was to visualise a piano keyboard and practise the piano part on the imaginary keyboard, so when I got back I was able to play it. You never know when a song will hit you. I once woke up in the middle of the night with Bang the Drum All Day in my head. It wasn’t a song I’d normally have written, but I’ve realised that my subconscious doesn’t stop when I go to sleep. Did Levon Helm really chase you around the studio when the Band were making Stage Fright ? tomcasagranda There may have been an episode. It was my first major project as an engineer and I was a smart-ass kid, like calling Garth [Hudson] “old man” thinking he was too old to stay awake, not realising he had narcolepsy. I wasn’t into that kind of music and not cognitive of the fact the Band were one of the biggest acts in the world. They suddenly had all the money, drugs, drink and sycophants available to them and it affected some of the guys. Levon got into opiates so while he may have chased me round the studio he spent as much time underneath a pile of curtains, dead to the world. In later years they all became my friends … except Robbie [Robertson], who was kind of a snob. When you produced Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, did [composer] Jim Steinman mean it, or was it a parody of the ever earnest Bruce Springsteen? roxusrollus Steinman never admitted what a Springsteen fan he was, even though he took me to see him, but from my point of view it was a parody. Everyone they’d played stuff to had said the songs were too long and Meat Loaf was too weird, but I heard it in the context of Springsteen’s leather jackets/50s thing – but not a handsome guy from New Jersey, a big sweaty guy. It’s not that well known that Steinman had a keen sense of humour, so even in the most sincere moments Steinman is taking it purposely over the top. That album unleashed a force upon the world – the brand of excess. After that everything Steinman did was excessive. With Meat Loaf during Musicourt ‘82 at Forest Hills in New York City. Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images What was Laura Nyro like when you worked together – and why do you think she’s not held up alongside the likes of Joni Mitchell and Carole King? laurasnapes I met her just after Eli and the Thirteenth Confession [1968] and was in awe of her. She asked me to be her bandleader but I was busy with my own band, the Nazz. Over a decade later she’d built a house with a studio but couldn’t get an album started so called me in desperation. We worked on each song until she was satisfied, but I became uncomfortable because she had a girlfriend there offering opinions which meant more than mine. I withdrew, but she did finish the record [Mother’s Spiritual, 1984]. Her music was remarkably sophisticated and passionate, completely individual, but audiences don’t really want people who sound completely different to everybody else. Some artists exist to influence other artists, to go where others won’t and show them how. Your DIY approach to recording albums was apparently a huge influence on Prince, and Bebe Buell has spoken of a young and star-struck Prince Rogers Nelson waiting to meet you backstage at a show. Do you have any recollection of this? TheManWithoutFear No recollection whatsoever, which isn’t to say it didn’t happen. Prince took the play-every-instrument thing to another level. I wanted to write beyond what I could play and realised there are better players, whereas he tailored the songs to his capabilities as a player. So the drums are simple, certainly not like Stevie Wonder’s, who was a crazily funky drummer. I thought some of Prince’s stuff was great but some of the lyrics made no sense to me at all. I don’t know what the hell Purple Rain is. Is it some kind of pollution? Rundgren poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California, circa 1977. Photograph: Aaron Rapoport/Getty Images Did you keep the amusing letters that John Lennon sent you? kaipahead I met him at a party in the period he was drinking with Harry Nilsson and misbehaving all over Hollywood. He looked like a bundle of rags in the corner and as a Beatles fan I was disappointed that he had nothing to say. Later I was being interviewed by NME and I said something along the lines of that you can’t be a revolutionary and preach one thing if you’re behaving in another way, and that became the headline. John wrote a letter ostensibly to me but as an open letter in NME. There was a kerfuffle. Then one day I got a call and it was John, saying: “I think we’re being used here, so let’s bury the hatchet.” I said: “Fine” and that was that. What do you think of the XTC album Skylarking, 39 years after you produced it? Is it hard to divorce the record from the notoriously fraught recording sessions? Angrysince1967 I don’t think Andy [Partridge] ever wanted a producer. He’d already steamrollered over the likes of Steve Lillywhite and Gus Dudgeon. When I did Skylarking, Gus sent me a letter of condolence. Everything came to a head when we recorded Earn Enough for Us, the only song on the entire album where they played together. It was great, but the next day Andy made Colin [Moulding] punch in every note of the bass part. I said “Oh God, for once you did something like XTC the band …” and Andy flipped out. I told him “I’m just trying to make the best record I can for you guys”, and he said “Then why do I feel like cleaving your head in with an axe?” Andy told anyone that would listen that it was the worst record they ever made, but I heard he has since confessed it’s one of their best. Rundgren performs on the Midnight Special. Photograph: NBC/Universal/Getty Images When you produced the New York Dolls ’ debut did you realise the record would prove so divisive – a well-known UK television presenter called them “mock rock”? willcantopher I don’t think that was inaccurate. Most people categorise them as punk rock simply because John Lydon cited them as the principle influence on the Sex Pistols. Technically the New York Dolls wanted to be the Rolling Stones: that album cover is straight from the Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? era. The more cynical rock critics like Lester Bangs liked them because it was the kind of music a rock critic could play – three chords. Even though the Dolls were New York celebrities in Max’s Kansas City every night they all lived out on Long Island, some of ’em with their moms. To say you’re prolific would be an understatement. I particularly like Liars, State and White Knight of your most recent catalogue. How do you rate these albums in your body of work? MonsieurMadeleine With Liars I was getting my sea legs after the transition from the traditional record company model to the internet thing. State was essentially me trying to get up to date with techniques I’d kinda pioneered in the 70s but another generation had taken over, like electronic and drum’n’bass. White Knight was my first serious collaborative record, so I wasn’t continually stewing in my own juices. For my last album, Space, I got people to give me demos of songs they’d never finished, and we’d finish them together. I am working on a new record, which I’ll finish after the next touring leg, but playing live keeps me youthful. My body likes me to get out there for two and a half hours each night.

07e8204786f9,UK woman who travelled with husband to assisted dying clinic will not face charges,,"A woman who accompanied her husband to an assisted dying clinic in Switzerland has been told she will not face charges. Louise Shackleton, 59, handed herself in to police on her return from a Dignitas clinic after the death of her husband, Anthony, last December. North Yorkshire police said this week that although the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was evidence of assisted suicide, it was not in the public interest to prosecute her. In England and Wales, “assisting a suicide” is a crime with a maximum sentence of 14 years. A similar law is in place in Northern Ireland. There is no specific crime of “assisting a suicide” in Scotland, but it is possible that helping a person to die could lead to prosecution for culpable homicide. Shackleton’s husband decided to end his life at Dignitas, in Zurich, six years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. She said his condition had deteriorated to the point where he would choke on his food. He considered options for ending his life and decided on an assisted death at Dignitas. “It was his choice, his autonomy, how he died and when he wanted to die,” Shackleton told ITV Tyne Tees . She sought advice before travelling to the clinic with her husband and handed herself in to police at Manchester airport last December. “I had literally been crying for 24 hours and couldn’t see properly and could just see uniforms. It wasn’t actually police, it was Border Force, but they were absolutely brilliant with me. They were just so kind and compassionate,” she said. After hearing that she would not be prosecuted, she said: “The worst thing in my life had already happened. There’s nothing anyone could have done to me to make anything any worse. “But for my children, for my boys, it was lovely that I could give them that news that they didn’t have to worry about their mum any more.” She told the Mirror : “I have had the excruciating pressure of a possible court case being brought against me. “If my husband had taken his own life in this country the scenario would have been extremely different. I would not have been criminalised, I would have been supported … However if someone decides to take their life in a foreign country, the family member who is with them is automatically under suspicion.” A North Yorkshire police spokesperson said: “This has clearly been a complex and sensitive investigation which has required detailed examination by the Crown Prosecution Service. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion “Whilst they concluded the evidential test had been met regarding assisted suicide, it was decided not to be in the public interest to prosecute.” Dignity in Dying, which campaigns for a change in the law to allow assisted dying for terminally ill adults, said the decision “comes as a significant relief to a grieving family. The trauma of a months-long investigation lays bare the cruelty of the status quo on assisted dying in the UK. No one should have to endure a criminal investigation for an act of compassion at the end of their loved one’s life.” The House of Lords has begun detailed scrutiny of a private member’s bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, brought forward by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. The bill passed its third reading in the Commons in June. Dignity in Dying said: “The status quo is not neutral, it is actively harmful. It forces dying people to travel abroad to seek a dignified death and leaves their loved ones facing police interviews, investigations and legal uncertainty at the very worst time in their lives.”",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/16/woman-who-travelled-with-husband-to-assisted-dying-clinic-will-not-face-charges,Society,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c2475c76308d1f015775f3390a6285eec2cc86/0_132_3236_2588/master/3236.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b5018d40b7e6e7cf8f4ebc960d59b43",2025-10-16T16:04:10+00:00,e828cd571b09a0292c8694c0d46fcf56464325f9
3f704d09515d,Head of CPS faces cross-party pressure to explain China spy trial collapse,,"The director of public prosecutions has come under intense cross-party pressure to explain why the China spy trial collapsed as MI5 expressed frustration at the decision and MPs launched a series of inquiries into how it was taken. The chairs of the home affairs, foreign affairs, justice and national security committees wrote together to Stephen Parkinson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), on Thursday calling on him to give “a fuller explanation for the dropping of charges”. They asked Parkinson “what steps did you take to make ministers aware” that the case was at risk of collapse because of a change in the case law that required China to be designated a “threat to the national security of the UK”. The committee chairs also asked if a key government witness, one of the UK’s deputy national security advisers, Matthew Collins, was warned his evidence may be insufficient and “what consideration was given to seeking evidence from other sources” as to the level of security threats posed by China. Parkinson is expected to be brought before MPs to explain why the CPS dropped charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, in September, a month before a trial had been due to take place. Earlier on Thursday, MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum, said he was frustrated at the decision and revealed security services had disrupted a threat from Beijing within the last week, though it was not related to parliament. Ken McCallum, the director general of MI5. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/AFP/Getty Images/PA “Of course I am frustrated when opportunities to prosecute national security threatening activity are not followed through for what ever reason,” the spy chief said, emphasising he would “never back off from confronting threats to the UK”. Chinese state actors, McCallum added, posed a national security threat “every day” and he warned that the number of all individuals under investigation by the spy agency over state-based threats from all countries had risen by 35% in the past year. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, reiterated his disappointment that the case was dropped and stressed there was no government involvement in the decision. Downing Street argued that it would have been “frankly absurd” for the prime minister to intervene when he was told a few days in advance that the case was on the brink of collapse. Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, also wrote to Parkinson demanding he release all the correspondence the CPS exchanged with the government about its evidence. The row concerns the decision to abandon a prosecution under the 1911 Official Secrets Act against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher for the Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, on 15 September. Christopher Cash, left, and Christopher Berry were the two men accused of spying for Beijing. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images The CPS said previously it had dropped the case because the government had not provided sufficient evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, a definition required by the espionage legislation, which has since been repealed. On Wednesday, Starmer published the three witness statements submitted by Collins in an attempt to dispel claims that the government had a hand in disrupting the trial. But the prime minister still faces questions over why he did not step in to stop the case from being dropped over the contents of the government’s evidence. Parkinson told committee chairs at a private meeting on Wednesday that the evidence was just 5% off what was required, having said earlier that prosecutors tried for “many months” to obtain what was needed. Ministers have also faced questions over why the final statement submitted by Collins echoed the Labour government’s policy towards China, despite Starmer’s insistence throughout that the collapsed case relied upon the previous Tory government’s stance. Downing Street said Collins had included the line at his own initiative to provide context about the current government policy. The joint committee on the national security strategy (JCNSS) and the intelligence and security committee (ISC) will both hold inquiries into the matter , which will have the power to compel ministers, prosecutors and government and intelligence officials to give evidence. Unlike select committees, the ISC has statutory powers to compel witnesses. Its chair, Lord Beamish, said it had “received the intelligence background behind the case” and now planned to “investigate how that classified material was then used”. The government is still pushing ahead with its reset in UK-China relations, with several high-level trips planned this year including another by the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. Plans are being drawn up for Starmer to make a bilateral visit to China next year. China said spying allegations contained in the evidence from Collins were false and that it never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs. An embassy spokesperson added: “The so-called ‘witness statements’ released after the CPS dropped the case are rife with unfounded accusations against China. They are nothing but sheer fabrications made out of thin air.” A crunch decision over whether to approve controversial proposals for a huge Chinese embassy in east London was delayed for the second time, and will now be taken on or before 10 December. The head of MI5 signalled he was relatively relaxed about the embassy proposal, which could clear the way for ministers to approve it despite vehement opposition from critics. “MI5 has more than a century of experience of dealing with the national security risks, which do flow from the presence of foreign embassies on British soil,” McCallum said. He said MI5 and sister agency GCHQ had the available counter-espionage expertise and were advising ministers on how to handle the development. “You would expect us to give our best professional security advice to government and you would expect us to keep that advice private,” he said. However, Matt Western, the chair of the JCNSS, wrote to the government on Monday warning that approving the embassy was “not in the UK’s long-term interest”. In a letter to Steve Reed, the housing secretary, who is responsible for taking the decision, Western said the proposed location of the outpost posed “eavesdropping risks in peacetime and sabotage risks in a crisis” owing to its proximity to fibre-optic cables, datacentres and telecoms exchanges serving Canary Wharf and the City. The Guardian revealed last year that China was blocking the much-needed redevelopment of Britain’s embassy in Beijing while the fate of its own proposed embassy was being decided.

fa9e40686aa7,The Guardian view on UK national security: a case of state failure,,"T he China spying row has revealed disturbing weaknesses in the processes of the UK state. It cannot be in the national interest for a case involving national security to get so close to the courts and then for it to be abandoned in what remain mysterious circumstances. Public confidence, as well as security itself, are inevitably placed at risk. But this genuinely important issue now risks being blanketed by the fog of the party-political battle at Westminster. For the third time this week, MPs spent Thursday trading accusations about whether the Conservatives or Labour are more to blame for the fiasco of last month’s collapsed prosecution. To be fair, the latest exchanges did not descend to the abject “did-didn’t” level that was reached at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday . Politicians from Sir Keir Starmer down are fond of saying that the national interest comes before the party interest. But there has been too little evidence of that principle in the current dispute. The main issue is not, in fact, whether China is a security threat to the UK. That is a no-brainer. Many countries, including Britain, spy on their foes – and perhaps on some of their friends too. But the threat posed by China reflects its size, wealth and values. Delivering his annual threat update on Thursday, the head of MI5, Sir Ken McCallum , said that he encountered that threat on a daily basis. “Do Chinese state actors present a UK national security threat?” he asked. “The answer is, of course, yes.” What is in doubt is whether the processes of the British state are as well honed as they should be to cope with such cases in modern circumstances. The collapse of an alleged spying case involving one of the three countries identified by Sir Ken as the chief threats to the UK – Iran and Russia are the others – provides its own answer. Very obviously, this was a case of state failure. The governance problem is on two levels. The first is that the law has not kept pace. The two defendants (who denied any wrongoing) were charged and faced trial under the Official Secrets Act 1911, which was still in force when they were first arrested. Yet the security world of 2025 is radically different from that of 1911. Hence the changes brought in by the National Security Act in 2023. Hence, also, the pressure at a late stage to strengthen the witness statements by civil servants that were published this week. But the law should, and could, have been reformed years ago. The second problem is with decisions to prosecute in national security cases. This necessarily involves a sensitive balance between the government, as the primary custodian of the national interest, and the independent Crown Prosecution Service , headed by the director of public prosecutions. Ministers insist that, like the head of MI5, they wanted the China trial to go ahead. But the collapse of the case suggests that this government and these law officers have got that balance wrong. That must change. Fairly or unfairly, the China case collapse damages trust. It makes Sir Keir’s government look hesitant where national security is concerned. Labour’s struggle to get its story straight has not helped. This even has distant echoes of the very first Labour government, which fell after Ramsay Macdonald’s decision not to proceed with the Campbell incitement to mutiny case in 1924. Labour now has a big majority, while Mr Macdonald had none at all, but Sir Keir should not underestimate the stakes.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/16/the-guardian-view-on-uk-national-security-a-case-of-state-failure,politics,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa142646dc817c64c276bb421e936cef66a3b847/351_0_4988_3989/master/4988.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4ce4fccde12a8a33b2556935a8f97a08",2025-10-16T17:48:19+00:00,fbb3574344252daee62860a409dffa4e63514fad
3e7d74847a52,Zelenskyy to make missiles case in US as Trump plans to meet Putin in Budapest,,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to head to the White House for a crucial meeting with Donald Trump, with the possible supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles expected to top the agenda. The US president has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks that he may deliver Tomahawks, which would give Kyiv its longest-range weapon yet that would be capable of striking Moscow with accurate, destructive munitions. “If this war doesn’t get settled, I may send Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. “A Tomahawk is an incredible weapon. And Russia does not need that. If the war is not settled, we may do it. We may not. But we may do it,” he added. The missile has a range of up to 1,500 miles. Trump, fresh from brokering a peace deal in Gaza, has signalled he is eager to build on the momentum of that diplomatic victory by increasing pressure on Moscow to end Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year. Twice over the weekend, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as ‘productive’ talks. Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP On the eve of Zelenskyy’s visit, Trump said he was planning to meet Putin in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on a date still to be determined in an effort to end the war. They previously met in Alaska in August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough. The announcement of another Trump-Putin summit followed a phone call with the Russian president. “I believe great progress was made,” Trump said on social media of the call. In the past, Trump has set deadlines for Moscow and vowed to impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s economy, only to back down. He has frequently softened his stance after speaking to or meeting Putin. While supplying Tomahawks, the idea of which has already annoyed the Kremlin, would be symbolically significant, they are only available in relatively small numbers, estimated by some experts at 20 to 50 missiles. Twice over the weekend, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as “productive” talks – a stunning reversal from February’s White House dressing-down that had laid bare the rift between the two leaders. “He [Zelenskyy] would like to have Tomahawks,” Trump said on Tuesday. We have a lot of Tomahawks.” Tomahawk cruise missiles are usually launched from ships or submarines, which Ukraine does not have. Photograph: US Navy/Getty Images Tomahawk were first used in combat in 1991 and normally launched from ships and submarines, which Ukraine does not have. They cost an estimated $1.3m (£1m) each and have a range that puts Moscow well within reach as well as offering far greater destructive power than long-range drones. There is also a relatively new land-launched variant, the Typhon, more obviously suitable for Ukraine, but the launchers are in short supply. The US army is known only to have two, although another launcher, the X-Mav, which is considered more mobile than the Typhon, was demonstrated this week. Tomahawks graphic Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute , said: “My understanding is that US doesn’t have a lot of Tomahawks. There are launchers that can launch them from the ground, but the military doesn’t have many of them.” Pavel Luzin, an independent Russian military analyst, said: “The Typhon system itself is new, still being produced for the US military. And it’s not just a launcher – it includes transport and reloading vehicles as well as a dedicated command post.” In recent weeks, the Trump administration also authorised the sharing of US intelligence to help Ukraine carry out precision strikes on Russia’s oil refineries using domestically produced drones and US-supplied Atacms missiles. These attacks have led to fuel shortages and a sharp rise in gasoline prices across Russia. Politicians and experts believe the cruise missiles could reinforce that strategy, though the missiles are generally considered most effective if launched in salvos, which would be difficult with limited numbers. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Institute for the Study of War estimates that there are 1,900 Russian military targets within range of the longer 1,500-mile plus Tomahawk variant. The key question, however, is whether Trump is dangling the prospect of supplying Tomahawks to pressure Putin, while remaining unwilling to take a step that could bring the US closer to direct confrontation with a leader he still calls a “close friend”. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska in August, but the summit did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters The Kremlin hassaid Ukraine’s reliance on Washington for training, logistics, and targeting intelligence to operate Tomahawks would draw the US into the war on a scale not seen before, undoing the progress Moscow claims to have made with the Trump administration. Some in Moscow said the Kremlin saw Trump’s talk of Tomahawks as little more than a negotiating gambit to pressure Putin – a move they said was unlikely to faze the Russian president. “Russia sees it as bluff from a bullshit artist in chief … The threat is not credible as there are no practical ways to do it in meaningful numbers. Russia will shrug it off,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat. Still, the Kremlin has in recent days issued its strongest warnings to Trump since he assumed office – a striking shift in tone for Moscow, where many had expected Washington to help secure a Ukraine settlement favourable towards Russia. Putin last week warned the US against supplying Tomahawks, saying their transfer would mark a “qualitatively new stage of escalation.” On Thursday, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov struck a similar note, telling the state-run Radio Mayak that the delivery of the cruise missiles to Ukraine “could lead to a qualitatively new level of escalation in the conflict”, adding: “It would be a very serious new step in that direction.” A former senior Russian defence official said Moscow was less worried about the impact of Tomahawks on the battlefield than about what delivery of the weapons would symbolise. “Moscow doesn’t believe Tomahawks will dramatically change the situation on the ground,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But it would be the clearest sign yet that Putin is losing Trump – and that is deeply concerning for them. Their delivery would cross a red line, after which Trump could feel emboldened to expand US arms supplies to Ukraine.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51cd3898c82e95c4273866b1f07667c6bfb3314/287_0_1654_1324/master/1654.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60e75365182b92c577660b14b7e3e749",2025-10-16T18:59:27+00:00,0b51e0d7054112d0be49abb4105256a86d8c1b00
15b5c0ac3e25,Woman alleged to have tortured and killed 12-year-old to stand trial in France,,"A woman who allegedly abused and tortured a 12-year-old girl before leaving her to suffocate will go on trial for murder on Friday in a case that has shocked France and caused political waves. Lola Daviet’s body was found stuffed into a plastic trunk that had been dumped on the street near her home. Dahbia Benkired, 27, is accused of the murder of a minor, aggravated rape, torture and an act of barbarity in a case that provoked widespread horror in France three years ago. The far right also attempted to make political capital from the killing after it was discovered Benkired, who was born in Algeria, had no right to remain in France and had been issued with an order to leave the country two months previously. Daviet had walked a few hundred yards from school and arrived at her home in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, where her parents were the building’s concierges, just after 3pm on Friday 14 October 2022. The building’s video surveillance records Benkired, who was homeless and unemployed but staying at her sister’s flat in the building, meeting Lola just after 3pm in front of the building. Daviet’s parents raised the alarm when their daughter did not arrive home. An hour and a half later, Benkired was filmed in the entrance hallway of the building surrounded by suitcases including a large trunk. Benkired, who was said to have given confused accounts of events, was examined by several psychiatrists and psychologists but judged able to stand trial. She has been held in Fresnes prison, south of Paris, for the last three years. Shortly after the killing, Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National attempted to make political capital out of the alleged murderer’s irregular migration status. Éric Pauget, of the rightwing Les Républicains, said in parliament that Lola had been killed as a result of France’s purported weakness on immigration.

6a6c0c401756,"Church of Norway says sorry to LGBTQ+ people for ‘shame, great harm and pain’",,"Against a backdrop of red stage curtains at one of Oslo’s most prominent LGBTQ+ spaces, the Church of Norway apologised for the discrimination and harm it had inflicted. “The church in Norway has caused LGBTQ+ people shame, great harm and pain,” the presiding bishop, Olav Fykse Tveit, said on Thursday. “This should never have happened and that is why I apologise today.” The “discrimination, unequal treatment and harassment” had caused some to lose their faith, Tveit acknowledged. A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology. The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the 2022 shooting that killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings. Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishops described gay people as a “social danger of global proportions”. Olav Fykse Tveit in the London Pub, Oslo, where he gave his speech of apology. Photograph: Javad Parsa/Reuters But as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed. In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able to marry in church since 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church. Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”. For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”. Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologised for what it described as its “shameful” treatment, though it continues to refuse to allow same-sex marriages in church. Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last year apologised for its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman. Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church life. “We have failed to celebrate and delight in all of your beautiful creation,” Rev Michael Blair, the general secretary of the church, said . “We have wounded people instead of seeking wholeness.

d35829064571,Manchester Pride ‘determining best way forward’ after claims performers have not been paid,,"Manchester Pride has said it is “determining the best way forward” with legal and financial advisers after allegations that its performers have not been paid. One of Europe’s biggest LGBTQ+ Pride events issued a statement after performers who took part in this year’s three-day festival claimed they are owed thousands in unpaid fees. In the statement posted on Instagram on Thursday, its board of trustees said: “Manchester Pride is currently in the process of determining the best way forward with our legal and financial advisers. “The aim is to provide additional communications by Wednesday 22 October. We will provide further information to our communities and stakeholders as well.” It added that it wanted to ensure that “our staff, intent, artists, contractors and suppliers, who are all a part of our community, are heard and considered”. Zahirah Zapanta, who appeared in season six of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, has claimed they haven’t been paid for their appearance, saying in an Instagram story: “It is deeply disappointing to share that Manchester Pride has failed to pay me, along with many other artists who performed at the events. Zapanta added that “repeated emails and requests regarding outstanding payments have been ignored”. The event, which took place at the end of August, came under fire in 2021 for ending its funding of two community charities while giving its chief executive a £20,000 pay rise. The BBC reported that Saki Yew, who was on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK in 2024, is also among those who say they haven’t been paid. Yew told the BBC: “As performers, we’re used to waiting for money but there’s no communication and no answer. A lot of performers are starting to give up hope of being paid.” Manchester city council has been approached for comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/16/manchester-pride-determining-best-way-forward-after-claims-performers-have-not-been-paid,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba04332d8e3490d5eca2fdfaf2b4eb18ffc0da29/1120_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33834316e404fb95c9ffb7f518f9fd7a",2025-10-16T17:49:59+00:00,c62330ac4567bf920a0e51c4930836b3b2b9cba4
d35d4d76f9b7,"Illinois governor JB Pritzker won $1.4m gambling last year, tax filings reveal",,"The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, made more than $1.4m while gambling in Las Vegas last year, according to federal tax filings released by his campaign team. Pritzker, already a billionaire with a family net worth of $41.6bn, who is widely seen as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, won the money after playing blackjack at a Las Vegas casino while on vacation with his wife and friends, according to his campaign spokesperson. The governor plans to donate his winnings to charity, his campaign told NBC. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Pritzker said: “I went on vacation with my wife, with some friends. I was incredibly lucky, you have to be to end up ahead, frankly, going to a casino anywhere. “It was in Las Vegas and I like to play cards … I founded a charitable poker match here in Chicago called the Chicago Poker Challenge that … has raised millions of dollars for the Holocaust museum here and particularly to stand up for civil rights. And so anyways, that’s all I can say about it. I mean, I had fun doing it. I encourage people to come to the state of Illinois and gamble in our casinos. We have some really lovely places to go,” Pritzker continued. He added that the $1.4m was a net number and that “it all happened over one trip”. “Anybody who’s played cards in a casino knows that … you often play for too long and lose whatever it is that you won. I was fortunate enough to have to leave before that happened,” the governor said. Pritzker is personally worth approximately $3.7bn and is an heir to the Hyatt hotels chain. Upon becoming governor in 2019, a position for which he does not receive a salary, Pritzker placed his assets into a “blind” trust, in which a beneficiary hands over control of assets to a trustee who manages them without the beneficiary’s knowledge. Nevertheless, Pritzker’s tax summaries have revealed that the governor made more than $10m in adjusted gross income last year, Capital News Chicago reported . The Democratic governor has emerged as one of Donald Trump ’s strongest critics , particularly as the president called for Pritzker to be jailed over his opposition towards the federal deployment of national troops to Chicago. Earlier this summer, he announced that he was running for a third gubernatorial term next year and in response to whether he is planning to run for president, Pritzker said : “I don’t know what the future holds … What I can tell you is I’m totally dedicated to upholding the rights of people in the state of Illinois and making sure that we’re protecting them, especially from a tyrant who’s taken over the White House.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/jb-pritzker-illinois-gambling-money,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30e730026554153d586b49203182ad52e8000305/493_42_2394_1916/master/2394.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b442b12881595b748c315e0d05c3d969",2025-10-16T18:30:09+00:00,20e5101ff565355c315b48226d8bd9a672be8f6e
46f2a1213a7d,Al Pacino on co-star and ex-girlfriend Diane Keaton: ‘She lived without limits’,,"Al Pacino has paid tribute to the his co-star and ex-romantic partner Diane Keaton who died last week . The 85-year-old actor had been filming in Paris and reportedly needed some time to put together his thoughts and feelings on Keaton, who died of pneumonia on Saturday at the age of 79. “When I first heard the news, I was shaken,” Pacino said to Deadline . “Diane was my partner, my friend, someone who brought me happiness and, on more than one occasion influenced the direction of my life. Though over thirty years has past since we were together, the memories remain vivid, and with her passing, they have returned with a force that is both painful and moving.” Pacino and Keaton starred together in The Godfather in 1972 and the pair had an on-and-off romantic relationship into the 1980s. Keaton once called him “the most entertaining man” who had “the most beautiful face”. “She lived without limits, and everything she touched carried her unmistakable energy,” Pacino said. “She opened doors for others, inspired generations, and embodied a once-in-a-lifetime gift that radiated through her work and her life. On screen, she was magnetic – lightning and charm, hurricanes and tenderness. She was a wonder. Acting was her art, but it was only one of the many ways she expressed her imagination and creativity.” He added that she was “unstoppable, resilient, and above all, deeply human”. Keaton told People in 2017 that she had a crush on Pacino when they started working together. “I was mad for him,” she said. “Charming, hilarious, a nonstop talker. There was an aspect of him that was like a lost orphan, like this kind of crazy idiot savant. And oh, gorgeous!” She said she “worked hard” on the relationship but when he wouldn’t commit to marriage, she gave him an ultimatum and it ended. “I went about it in not a perfect way,” she added. Pacino is one of many Hollywood names to have paid tribute to Keaton. Michael Douglas called her “one of the greatest icons in our industry” while Francis Ford Coppola called her “creativity personified”. Nancy Meyers, who directed Keaton in Something’s Gotta Give, also remembered a “giant” in an Instagram post. “A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories,” she wrote. “As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a film-maker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/al-pacino-diane-keaton,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf1bf35a8e0d1ead004c47ad375544fe0b6fdd5/125_0_2083_1667/master/2083.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=759b692424aa22404c94b11c58bc051e",2025-10-16T18:11:06+00:00,877b08c79aac96eca24f52b91c92eb52052e1ce4

A good effort, though the keeper Lena Pauels had it covered. 15 min There’s kind of nothing to report. It’s not a bad game at all; there just hasn’t been any incident. 11 min The match has become more evenly matched – and a little scruffier – after a very confident start from Arsenal. Still no shots on target at either end. 8 min And nothing comes of that either. Benfica are at least enjoying their first extended spell in the Arsenal half. 6 min Nothing comes of the Arsenal corner – and then Smith concedes one at the other end with an overhit pass back to Van Domselaar. 4 min No chances to speak of but Arsenal have started really well. Smith’s cross is turned behind for the first corner of the game… 1 min Peep peep! We’re under way in Lisbon and Arsenal are already zipping the ball around with confidence. “Some things to like in the Arsenal lineup, but also some things to fret over,” says Charles Antaki, inadvertently capturing the defailt emotional setting of the association football fan. “Good to see Taylor Hinds on from the start; she’s less, er, combative than Katie McCabe but seems to have more zip about her at the moment. Kyra Cooney-Cross in midfield will please a lot of fans who want a bit more oomph in that department. Delighted to see Lotte Wubben-Moy back in, of course; but it only underscores the fact that Leah Williamson is still very much out and very much missed. And at the back of it all there is the crisis–murmur. So a thoroughly convincing win, please.” Full time: Atletico Madrid 0-1 Man Utd As the players line up for the anthems in Lisbon, a quick note on a very hard-fought victory for Manchester United in Madrid.

Share Updated at 15.00 EDT Hello and welcome to live, minute-by-minute coverage of Benfica v Arsenal in the WCL. Arsenal’s Champions League defence got off to a false start last week with a 2-1 defeat at home to Lyon; and while it’s too early to talk of must-win games, they’ll be keen to get up and running tonight in Lisbon’s Estadio Jose Alvalade – the ground on which they beat Barcelona in last season’s final. It won’t be straightforward against a Benfica side who have won five Portuguese titles in a row. They also started this season’s competition with a 2-1 defeat, in their case away to Juventus. But unlike Arsenal, Benfica don’t have much pedigree in this tournament – at least not yet. Their best run, two seasons ago, ended with a 6-2 aggregate defeat to Lyon in the quarter-finals. Benfica, and Portuguese football more generally, will want to make a dent in the competition as soon as spossible. Victory over the reigning champions would be a nice place to start.

e4d6ae425cba,England and New Zealand find ‘special’ camaraderie amid hard graft,,"E ngland’s white-ball team have played 24 times this year, most recently a little more than three weeks ago . New Zealand’s have played 28 games, the latest was this month. These are groups who spend a lot of time together, but before the start of their Twenty20 series on Saturday both chiselled some space out of their schedule to do something surprisingly unusual with each other: nothing very much. Brendon McCullum took his team to Queenstown in New Zealand’s Southern Alps where, in Harry Brook’s words, they were “just left to our own devices”. There was some hiking, a bit of go-karting and, inevitably, a lot of golf. “We had an amazing time,” Brook said. “They’ve got some amazing golf courses down there and we were lucky enough to get on a couple of them. A couple of lads managed to get out and explore Queenstown. We had a few drinks here and there and team meals. “We had a lot of fun – it was about trying to spend a bit of time together because we don’t really get that in the white-ball [team]. If you’re having a lot of fun off the field and enjoying spending time with the lads, then it’s going to be even better on the field. So I encourage everybody under mine and Baz’s leadership to just enjoy themselves.” The Black Caps, meanwhile, were in the spa town of Hanmer Springs, attempting something very similar with the aid of thermal pools and water slides. “It was the first time in a very long time we had everyone in the room, everyone who’s involved in the Black Caps touring party and all the contracted players,” said Rachin Ravindra. “We’ve got a new coach [Rob Walter] and trying to understand our environment and go back to what we’ve been doing really well for the last few years and getting together is special. It’s more than your performances on the field, it’s also getting on well as mates and getting to know the coaches and support staff. The more we can understand and care for each other, the better.” Matt Henry, the New Zealand seamer, said: “When you have a small window to get guys together and work on the environment it’s always important. In the moving landscape of international cricket there’s people coming from all around the world and it’s important that when you get together you make sure you enjoy it. “It’s probably always been our strength, the people we have. It’s amazing to play for New Zealand, but to be able to share a dressing room with mates is pretty special too. It’s always good to acknowledge that and come to a series refreshed.” Harry Brook signs autographs for fans in Christchurch. Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty Images That feeling of being refreshed may be hard to maintain when some England players left home last Friday knowing they will not return for three months, with these three T20s to be followed by the same number of one-day internationals and then the short flight to Australia for the Ashes. There is an awareness that these extended periods away should not come to be seen as a grind. “Touring’s awesome,” Brook said. “I get to see some of the best places in the world, experience some of the greatest things with a load of my mates. I love touring. skip past newsletter promotion Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

3aedeb37b99e,Oisin Murphy: ‘I found escapism but also an awful lot of trouble in the bottle’,,"‘I didn’t feel good,” Oisin Murphy says with a grimace as he gestures towards the birthday cards still standing in his house more than a month since he turned 30. Murphy has already spoken for an hour, in raw and moving detail, about the guilt he will feel when he has to walk down a guard of honour to mark his fifth champion jockeys’ title at Ascot on Saturday, his daily struggle with alcoholism , his near catastrophic return to drinking this summer, the dangers of racing and the Sylvia Plath poem he loves most. But the milestone of his 30th birthday troubles him. “It was incredibly significant because I never thought I’d get to 30,” Murphy says, as he uses a smouldering cigarillo to light another in an unbroken chain stretching across this corner of Lambourn. They call it the Valley of the Racehorse and, on a Monday morning, mist hangs over the village – in the same way that Murphy is enveloped in a cloud of smoke. “I never had any plans past 30,” he says amid a fresh puff. Did he think he would die before then? “It wasn’t quite that morbid but all the time you have targets: ‘I want to win this race, I want to win this championship, I want my own house.’ I never made any targets past 30. “That’s another thing getting to 30. Lots of people are in serious relationships and beginning to have children. Maybe I’m selfish. I was in a very serious relationship with a beautiful girl and a lovely person, Elizabeth Nielsen. That ended at the beginning of this year, but we’re still very good friends. We still speak almost every day. Most of my ex-girlfriends I’ve remained friendly with, which is great. I never feel like the reason those relationships ceased was because of them. It was because of me.” Is he close to finding new targets for himself? “It’s very different now. Every day I have to work at being sober and it’s going well. But I’ve had good periods in the past … ” In late April he was driving at night when, with a passenger alongside him, he crashed into a tree . Murphy was fortunate that no one was hurt because, hours after the accident, he was “just shy” of having twice the legal limit for alcohol in his system. When the case went to court in July, he was fined £70,000 and banned from driving for 20 months. Murphy at his home in Berkshire: ‘Every day I have to work at being sober and it’s going well. But I’ve had good periods in the past.’ Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian These were the latest in a litany of punishments. Murphy’s longest suspension occurred in December 2021 when he was banned for 14 months by the British Horseracing Authority after he admitted various disciplinary offences, including misleading BHA officials, breaches of Covid-19 protocols and two failed breath tests. “During those 14 months I didn’t find it difficult to remain sober. I got some confidence thinking: ‘This is easy.’ What I failed to remember was I had no stress in my life. I wasn’t putting pressure on myself to ride winners. But that’s false confidence, because someone with a drink problem has to work at it every single day and that’s where I failed. “I tried numerous times to drink like a nice fellow, probably like you, a fellow that can have one, two and, on a crazy night, three glasses of wine or four pints of beer. Some days I was capable of doing it. But the days that I’m not capable? Dangerous is the correct word. Even with all the effort I was putting in I had to surrender [this year], I’m afraid.” Did he feel before his accident in April that he was sliding back into darkness? “No, I thought I was doing very well. I thought I had some controlled drinking evenings but I lied to myself. I did the same thing I’d done previous times and lost control. I didn’t need to drink-drive that evening. It was just awful. But I’m very lucky there weren’t more severe consequences because people don’t often get a second chance.” Murphy lights up a cigarillo at home. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Now, as he counts each new day of being sober, Murphy is mortified by his actions that night. His new book, Sacrifice, is an unsparing account of the all-consuming demands jockeys face and he admits that drink can be a refuge from gruelling travel, the constant need to “waste” and make weight and the perennial hazards of riding a racehorse at 40mph. Most of all, as he writes in his diary of last year’s championship victory, Murphy is tormented by a voracious need to win. Yet even generational jockeys lose more than three-quarters of their races. “It takes its toll if you try and escape and hide from it, because that’s when I was most susceptible to drinking to black out.” He now reminds himself, as soon as he wakes, about the importance of not drinking today. “In 2024 I prayed to be sober every day, and then I forgot. I still prayed that my family are healthy every single morning and night but it shows that, when someone really wants to drink, being sober is no longer on the priority list.” That quest is now paramount and Murphy attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings in different cities, wherever he is racing, and he stresses: “I’ve never had a problem saying: ‘I’m an alcoholic.’ “I listened to a man the other day. He was Irish and we were in London and he said: ‘Life is still shit. It’s not any better now that I’m sober. Actually it can feel worse – because I can’t run away from the shit parts. But one thing is clear to me. If I pick up a drink, it won’t be any fucking better.’ That stuck with me.” His father and grandfather both lived for decades with alcoholism. Does he believe the disease has genetic roots? “I don’t know. Both of them never drank during my lifetime. My dad really was a wonderful father. He never told us not to drink but he used to tell us about the pitfalls on the way to mass. He never shoved it down our throats and my father’s been 35 years sober.” Can he speak to him about his drinking problems? “I can. I tell him sometimes if I had a good [AA] meeting. About seven years ago he left this book on a table for me. It might have been the big [AA self-help] book. That was a hint.” Oisin Murphy: ‘There are a couple of hours where I feel I can walk on water. But it leaves and you don’t know when it’s going to return.’ Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Murphy laughs quietly and then says: “Counselling and therapy is great – if you’re completely honest. But if you hide anything, it’s a waste of time, not just for you but for the person trying to listen. That year I was off racing I thought therapy was the best thing in the world and my therapist was a female god. But I decided I could try and drink like a gentleman again.” Does he still see the same therapist? “I stopped seeing her in February and now I have a few. One man is Irish, and he’s dealt with Irish jockeys in the past. At Sporting Chance, I speak to a former alcoholic and heroin addict who has been clean and sober for 20-odd years. Those two fellows are very good. And there’s another female doctor who is also excellent. Do you know what I love about them? It’s often not scheduled. They’ll just ring up or WhatsApp message me for a chat. The problem with scheduled therapy is that you can almost plan what you want to say.” He shakes his head. “Everyone’s looking for a reason for Oisin Murphy’s drinking. Something terrible must have happened as a child. But it didn’t. I had a wonderful childhood. And hence I didn’t have a drink problem at 20. But the bottom line is I found escapism but also an awful lot of trouble in the bottle.” Murphy still has highs in the saddle: “The odd day where I feel like I did in Doncaster when I had that four-timer or round Salisbury a few weeks ago where I had another four-timer. There are a couple of hours where I feel I can do anything, that I can trust my instinct and walk on water. But it leaves and you don’t know when it’s going to return.” In his book Murphy insists he was so drained by winning the 2024 jockey title that he would never chase the championship again. Yet here we are, a year on, and Murphy will be crowned once more as the leading jockey. “I doubt myself a lot,” he says and he will try to avoid eye contact with the other jockeys as they form two lines to applaud his achievement. Murphy feels almost guilty. “Maybe it’s the realisation that a lot of the guys are as good, and talented, as me. They just don’t have the number or the quality of horses to ride. Maybe they aren’t as lucky in being able to communicate as well, but I don’t think there’s much separating us.” Jockeys risk serious injury, paralysis, even death and, as Murphy points out, most of his colleagues in the weighing room are doing “the exact same hours” as him, hacking up and down the motorways, riding seven days a week without the plaudits or the money he earns. Murphy after winning the Nunthorpe Stakes on Asfoora at York in August. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Murphy loves riding great horses and he is obsessed with winning, but his hinterland extends beyond racing. He talks about the crisis in Afghanistan and devastation in Gaza. “As I’ve got older, I’ve realised I don’t want to get too wrapped up in horse racing. I need to educate myself on other matters because I don’t want to be one of those fellows that’s still riding and he isn’t very good any more – and there’s nothing else to discuss.” He is “really interested in insurance” and the poetry of Plath. Murphy recently bought a new anthology of the American’s poems. “You have to go quite deep to understand what she’s saying. She lived in a time where there was also a stigma around having a mental health problem. But there’s much of her work I never get depressed by even though I comprehend how she’s leaving [the world].” He answers decisively when I ask him for his favourite Plath poem: “ Poppies in July . You feel the want and lust for escape.” It’s a short and painful poem. Yet Murphy stresses that, unlike Plath, he doesn’t experience depression. “Being busy helps because I have to go out early every morning, I’ve got things to do.” His searing focus is exhausting, but more manageable now. “I remember the 2019 championship season , when I was so tired and the pressure went up. But I was lacking sleep because I’d been drinking heavily. Now, on the whole, I’ve been sleeping well. I don’t feel exhausted. My lifestyle has never been better managed. It’s still hectic but it’s not chaotic.” As he gently waves away the pall of smoke around him, Murphy nods with the hard-won knowledge that now frames his life as a champion jockey and an intelligent yet vulnerable man. “It will remain absent of chaos provided I stay sober.” In the UK, Action on Addiction is available on 0300 330 0659.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/oisin-murphy-jockey-interview-horse-racing-alcoholism,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc24f1615d87d62264f5bc5c3c5ba5c4d332e112/182_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0fc851f98d64bf4ca9d7885066ede5a",2025-10-16T19:00:50+00:00,9d2f6c8eb900a3be6fc92da1d3a540bbb4b4ca83

Education ministers from across the nation, whose armies of school teachers will help police the restrictions, will assemble for the high-level meeting on Friday. Less than two months from the ban kicking in, federal communication minister Anika Wells and eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant are set to speak to state education ministers on Friday. The duo will unveil a resource package for both educators and parents to help them understand the laws and how to engage with kids on them.

First Peoples’ Assembly says not too late for Victorian Liberals to back treaty Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly says it’s not too late for the opposition to back the state’s Indigenous treaty bill as it passed parliament’s lower house on Thursday. The Coalition this week announced it would repeal the agreement – Australia’s first formal treaty with First Nations people – if elected next year. The opposition already withdrew its support for the treaty process after the failure of the 2023 referendum to change Australia’s constitution to create a federal voice to parliament. The bill passed the lower house with the support of Labor and Greens MPs. Opposition MPs voted against it. Assembly co-chair and Gunditjmara man Rueben Berg urged the opposition to support the bill in the upper house: Aboriginal voices from across the state have been clear that Treaty is the change we need to create a better future for our people. As the Bill moves to the upper house, my message to Liberal and National representatives is it’s not too late to again walk with us. Parliament’s upper house will debate the bill at the end of the month. Once the bill passes parliament, as expected with the support of the Greens and other progressive crossbenchers, the government and the assembly will formally sign the treaty agreement. Jacqui Lambie accuses parliamentary committee of 'stealth hearing' on controversial FOI bill The independent senator Jacqui Lambie has accused a parliamentary committee of conducting a “stealth hearing” on controversial changes to freedom of information legislation. The Senate referred the bill to an inquiry last month, which has now received submissions, will hold its first public hearing today and will make recommendations for the bill, which is due by 3 December. But notably absent from the list of submissions and list of witnesses is former senator and self-proclaimed “transparency warrior” Rex Patrick , who looks like he’s been “censored” says Lambie. The Tasmania senator also claims the committee did not provide advance notice to her office of the upcoming public hearing, despite her “strong interest” on the issue. “I have moved amendments on this legislation ... but I wasn’t notified of the hearing in a timely way. There’s something unusual going on here – it’s like they’re trying for a stealth hearing on changes to legislation that is about secrecy and transparency. What really blows me away is that the witness list has been published without consultation and it looks like Rex Patrick and [former ABC investigative journalist and barrister] Paul Farrell – two of the most experienced FOIers in the country – haven’t been invited to give evidence. It looks like Mr Patrick’s very comprehensive submission on the bill, has been censored. Mr Patrick did accuse the prime minister of hypocrisy in his submission, but his accusation is grounded in fact. Guardian Australia has contacted the committee secretary for comment. Hail and storms forecast for Sydney this afternoon Sydneysiders: batten down the hatches. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, a storm is coming. While the city is forecast to hit a high of 32C, it’ll get cloudier during the day and thunderstorms are likely in the afternoon and evening, possibly severe, with damaging winds and large hail. Good luck out there. For those outside the NSW capital, Perth will be sunny and 28C, Adelaide partly cloudy and 21, Melbourne cloudy and 20, Hobart showery and 16, Canberra windy and 27, and Brisbane sunny and 28. Ley says Albanese must get 'concrete outcomes' from Trump meeting The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has challenged Anthony Albanese to extract “concrete outcomes” on Aukus, trade and tariffs from his meeting with President Donald Trump next week. The prime minister heads to Washington DC on Sunday ahead of a White House meeting on Monday. It will be the first formal face-to-face meeting between Albanese and Trump, after a series of phone calls, a cancelled meeting in Canada and a brief chat in New York last month. The Labor government is downplaying prospects of any immediate outcomes on the Pentagon’s Aukus review, tariffs on Australia, or a mooted critical minerals deal coming during Albanese’s trip. But Ley has continued the opposition’s criticism that Albanese hasn’t met Trump before now. She said she’d written to Albanese saying she hoped to see an assurance on the American review of Aukus, “real commitment” on pillar two of the Aukus agreement on future technologies, a “deal” on Trump’s trade tariffs and progress on Australia becoming a supplier of advanced weapons systems. Ley wished Albanese well, but yet again noted “this meeting could have, and should have, occurred sooner.” When it comes to the prime minister stepping into the Oval Office, there is only Team Australia. But this must be more than a photo opportunity, Australians are relying on the PM to deliver. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog.

f8df95ddcf83,US Senate vote to end government shutdown fails for 10th time,,"The US Senate failed on Thursday to re-open the government and to vote to fund the military during the federal government shutdown, ensuring that the standoff will stretch into next week. The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed for the 10th time with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding in the afternoon similarly failed in a floor vote, meaning the process to begin fully funding military operations also becomes a non-starter. After the votes, senators are expected to leave Washington for the weekend, almost guaranteeing the shutdown lasts until at least Monday. Thursday’s vote on defense spending exposed how deep the divisions go in the Senate, with only three Democratic senators – Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada – breaking ranks to support the measure. The $852bn bill had sailed through subcommittee in July, led by appropriations committee leaders Chris Coons, a Delaware senator, and Mitch McConnell, a senator from Kentucky, with broad Democratic backing. But the politics on it have fallen apart since then. “I won’t vote just for the defense appropriations bill, even though that’s my bill,” Coons, the top Democrat on the appropriations panel overseeing military spending, told reporters. The Senate majority leader, John Thune , made his clearest offer yet to Democrats on Thursday morning, telling MSNBC he would guarantee them a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies – the most crucial ask from the Democratic side – by a fixed date if they agree to reopen the government. “At some point, Democrats have to take yes for an answer,” Thune said. On Wednesday evening, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pre-emptively rejected that kind of promise during a 90-minute CNN town hall , insisting they need actual legislation signed into law before they will budge. “I don’t accept IOUs. I don’t accept pinky promises. That’s not the business that I’m in,” Ocasio-Cortez told the audience. When asked if a Trump pledge would be enough, Sanders replied mockingly: “Oh yeah, no doubt, because the president is a very honest man.” The New York congresswoman and Vermont senator rejected any short-term fix, calling it an attempt to delay political pain until after next year’s midterm elections. “What we will not accept is for the ACA premiums to skyrocket on the American people,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez participate in a CNN town hall, moderated by Kaitlan Collins, in Washington DC on Wednesday. Photograph: Eric Lee for CNN After the shutdown vote fail on Thursday, the White House put out a press release calling the town hall a “clown show”. “Make no mistake: Chuck Schumer and his band of obstructionists – on orders from the Radical Left lunatics in control of the party – deliberately shuttered the government to extort their socialist agenda at the expense of hardworking Americans,” the White House statement read. Meanwhile, the House speaker, Mike Johnson , has kept the chamber out of session for four weeks after Republicans passed their funding bill, with GOP leaders arguing that returning to Washington would only reduce pressure on Senate Democrats. Johnson and the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have traded barbs over the month, and have now agreed to debate on C-Span , though no date has been set. Thune said he would support extending the healthcare subsidies if they included reforms such as income caps, but he would not commit to a one-year extension estimated to cost $35bn annually, and acknowledged he could not guarantee an outcome. He did not rule out the potential for the shutdown to run until Thanksgiving, over a month away: “I hope it doesn’t last through Thanksgiving,” he said. The standoff has left federal workers without paychecks for weeks, with no end in sight . At the CNN town hall, one worker with four children asked how he was supposed to feed his family. Another woman said her housing was at risk because the shutdown had blocked her government-backed loan. Ocasio-Cortez tried to reassure them while holding firm: “My hope is that we’re ready to resolve this as quickly as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/government-shutdown-aoc-bernie-sanders-republicans,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15a5affc9d387a8e92b23be694fb5dc70295d967/997_0_5662_4531/master/5662.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=18a47058d75fd4e43cc02560b3c44920",2025-10-16T19:57:07+00:00,5f53b83c23b7c3ca3e3b13f11a74dcaedd1173cc
765b1d61d6dd,US regional bank stocks fall amid Wall Street concern over credit markets,,"US regional banking stocks fell sharply on Thursday after two banks disclosed issues with bad and fraudulent loans, amplifying concerns on Wall Street around the state of credit markets. Zions Bancorp announced it had a $50m charge-off over two bad loans from its subsidiary, California Bank & Trust in San Diego. Western Alliance also said it was dealing with a fraudulent borrower. Zions stock was down over 11% by Thursday afternoon, while Western Alliance was down over 10%. Shares of Jefferies Financial Group were down 9% for the day. The sell-off knocked the wider market, with the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Dow Jones down 0.6% in New York. The regional banking industry has been under scrutiny after First Brands, an auto parts supplier, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September over creditor concerns. In its bankruptcy filing, First Brands disclosed that it had at least $10bn to $50bn in liabilities against $1bn to $10bn in assets, the product of what appeared to be risky off-balance-sheet financing. Amid the bankruptcy, First Brands’ creditors filed an emergency court filing saying that $2.3bn of the company’s assets had “simply vanished”. Prosecutors at the justice department said they were investigating the bankruptcy, and regional banks have faced intense scrutiny in light of what some worry were questionable lending practices. Jefferies, a regional bank, and UBS said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to First Brands. Shares in Jefferies have fallen 25% over the past month. In the aftermath, some experts have pointed out the bankruptcy shows cracks in the system that allows for “shadow banking” – when a borrower turns to private services outside the traditional banking system to get financing. In the case with First Brands, the company gave lenders unpaid invoices as a form of collateral. On a call with analysts on Tuesday, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said his “antenna goes up when things like that happen”. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” he said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/us-regional-bank-stocks-fall,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faec43000dcb303c0774a46833784afc551de59d/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=022d31b23bc2d6b0ea9091410b6f8ee5",2025-10-16T19:19:08+00:00,d516a32fff974b2563e1a51c9644baac629734e9
d427560abdca,Judge orders federal immigration officers in Chicago area to wear body cameras,,"Federal immigration officers in the Chicago area have been ordered by a court to wear body cameras after they repeatedly deployed pepper balls, smoke grenades and tear gas against protesters and local police , seemingly in violation of a federal judge’s ruling from last week. Sara Ellis, a US district judge, who had previously required immigration agents to wear badges and banned them from using riot-control techniques such as tear gas without warning, railed on Thursday against the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) continued aggressive tactics, many of which have been caught on camera , and which appear to violate her order. “I live in Chicago if folks haven’t noticed,” she said on Thursday. “And I’m not blind, right?” Ellis added: “I’m getting images and seeing images on the news, in the paper, reading reports where I’m having concerns about my order being followed.” Her new requirement of immigration officers using body cameras comes as Chicago has become the latest focal point of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in recent weeks, with forceful federal enforcement, led by Ice but also including other agencies, and as DHS has been relying on extreme strategies against immigrants and citizens alike, in the Chicago area and elsewhere. At the same time, locals in Chicago have been organizing to prevent arrests within their communities, while DHS has compared those efforts to “rioting” and said it “is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers”. On Tuesday, after federal agents led a car chase and caused a multi-car collision, protesters chanted “Ice go home” and threw objects at the agents, who, seemingly without warning, threw tear gas in the direction of the protesters – and 13 Chicago police officers who were also on the scene. Elsewhere on Tuesday, a masked agent cursed at protesters, ordering them to back away while pinning a 19-year-old, Warren King, to the sidewalk, while a witness shouted “he’s a citizen,” and it was unclear why King was under arrest, the New York Times reported . On Sunday, when attorney Samay Gheewala tried to ask agents for a warrant as they detained an immigrant in his neighborhood, he was shoved to the ground so hard his hands bled. Agents later threw tear gas toward the crowd of protesters that had amassed. Meanwhile, some local schoolchildren ended up obliged to stay indoors for recess after tear gas filled the streets near their playground. Similar anecdotes have emerged across the country, even as former immigration officials warn that arrests appear to be indiscriminate and sweeping under the pressure that the Trump administration has imposed on officers to deport as many people as possible. “They don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety,” John Sandweg, a former acting Ice director, told Politico. “They just say, ‘If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.’” The Associated Press contributed reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/chicago-ice-immigration-body-camera,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b3949b4d4dfb343fe7d470fd6392afee33dd0f/333_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e9cc1d36cccbe5b40426dc82baa4f05",2025-10-16T19:14:06+00:00,79a142f034b33bcb9059d9fba511159c769b9714
01f64ca1e3ba,A surge of visitors to Yosemite overwhelms a skeleton crew: ‘This is exactly what we warned about’,,"C ars and RVs surged into Yosemite national park throughout the weekend, as visitors from around the world came to enjoy the crisp autumn weather, undeterred by a lack of park services and the absence of rangers. National parks have largely been kept open through the lapse in US federal funding that has left workers furloughed and resources for the parks system more scarce than usual. But as the US government shutdown enters its third week and legislators warn that their impasse could linger even longer than the one in Donald Trump ’s first term – which currently holds the record at 35 days – concerns are mounting over how the nation’s treasured public lands will fare. Even with winter weather setting in along the Sierra, which will create more dangerous conditions, visitors continued to pour into the park, filling campgrounds and parking lots over the long weekend. Already, there have been widespread reports of illegal activity in Yosemite. People have been spotted Base jumping off high granite peaks, swimming in reservoirs where it is prohibited, camping and parking in unauthorized areas and climbing Half Dome’s cables without permits. The issues aren’t only affecting Yosemite. A fire ignited near a Joshua Tree campground on Sunday morning, forcing evacuations and closures in the park . Wildland firefighters are exempt from the shutdown and responded rapidly, according to a National Park Service spokesperson, and by Monday afternoon, crews had mostly contained the small blaze. But advocates voiced concerns that the fire – which is still under investigation but is believed to be human-caused, according to NPS officials – is a reminder of the increased risks posed by the public during staff shortages. In Yosemite, one of the limited park employees seen on duty during the holiday weekend, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to comment publicly, said it had been chaotic. “Then again, when is it not?” he added sardonically. Relying on funds pulled from entrance fees collected before the shutdown – a budget kept separate from federal appropriations – Yosemite has retained maintenance and emergency services to ensure bathrooms, trash and campgrounds are kept up and emergency operations continue. A concessionaire, Yosemite Hospitality, has also continued to operate. Vehicles wait in line to enter Joshua Tree national park in California, on 10 October 2025. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images Previous use of these fees, collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, to support park operations during shutdowns was found to be a violation of the law by a 2019 Government Accountability Office analysis. And, even with trash cans emptied and toilets cleaned, the loss of key staff could be keenly felt. “It felt like you showed up to school and none of the teachers were there,” said Mark Rose, the Sierra Nevada & clean air senior program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, after spending a portion of last week at Yosemite. “You could tell the janitors had been there the night before and maybe there were hall monitors there – but we are missing this big piece.” Workers who provide other essential functions such as trail maintenance, those who offer support and monitor visitation at entrance gates, and staff responsible for ongoing conservation or maintenance projects have not been able to continue working. On Saturday, as droves of vehicles rolled through entrances where fees typically would have been collected and guidance given, they were met with signs on the empty booths that read: “During this lapse in appropriations parks will remain as accessible as possible. We are doing our best to take care of your parks at this time, but some amenities and services may not be available.” In one booth, the sign was accompanied by a second: a hand-drawn bluebird with the familiar scrawl of a child pleading: “Put park rangers first.” Dangerous, damaging and illegal activity was a chief concern among advocates when the administration opted to keep parks accessible without adequate staffing. Before the start of this shutdown, national park leaders and advocates had pushed the Trump administration not to repeat its previous policies of 2018-19, when the parks were kept open and unstaffed, leading to widespread destruction . The welcome center in Yosemite Valley in Yosemite national park on 5 October 2025. Photograph: Ruaridh Stewart/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock “National parks don’t run themselves. It is hard-working National Park Service employees that keep them safe, clean and accessible,” 40 former superintendents said in a letter issued to Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, in the week leading up to the lapse. “If sufficient staff aren’t there, visitors shouldn’t be either.” Irreversible damage was done at popular parks, including Joshua Tree in California, following a month-long shutdown in Donald Trump’s first term, when his administration demanded parks be kept open while funding was paused and workers were furloughed. Without supervision, visitors left behind trails of wreckage. Prehistoric petroglyphs were vandalized at Big Bend national park. Joshua trees, some more than a century old, were chopped down at Joshua Tree national park, as trash and toilets overflowed. Tire tracks crushed sensitive plants and desert habitats from illegal off-roading vehicles in Death Valley. There were widespread reports of wildlife poaching, search-and-rescue crews were quickly overwhelmed with calls, and visitor centers were broken into. “This is exactly what we warned about,” Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, said in a statement issued following the reports of how visitors were behaving in Yosemite. “This shutdown is making an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse. And the longer this goes, the worse it is going to get. The situation is dangerous and reckless for our parks, public lands, and the visitors who love them.” Burgum called the Yosemite incidents “misinformation” in a post on the social media platform X on Tuesday, and falsely claimed the park was “fully staffed”. “Yosemite has a full team working to uphold public safety and preserve the integrity of the park,” he said, before blaming Democrats for the shutdown. “Unauthorized camping, squatting, and illegal activities like BASE jumping are being addressed with firm, appropriate law enforcement action.” Katie Martin, Department of Interior’s communications director, echoed Burgum’s claims and disputed that there are unmonitored campgrounds and widespread squatting. “Our on-the-ground teams confirm that these reports do not accurately reflect current operations or visitor conditions,” Martin said, adding that all law enforcement rangers in the park remain on duty and have been handling both frontcountry and backcountry patrols. There are 1,545 campgrounds within the park, but the 13 major sites are staffed, according to Martin, who also said visitor disputes and etiquette issues are not unusual and are being handled as they typically would under normal operations. “Yosemite remains safely managed. Law enforcement, emergency response, and campground staff are on duty, and visitation levels remain well within normal ranges,” Martin added. According to a recent National Park Service contingency plan created to guide parks during the shutdown, more than 9,200 employees were furloughed system-wide, reducing NPS staff by roughly 64%. Only workers deemed necessary to protect “life and property”, were set to remain on duty. Even before the shutdown began, sharp reductions in staffing that came as part of the Trump administration’s plans to shrink the federal government left gaps in an NPS workforce already stretched thin. According to Rose of the National Parks Conservation Association, the long-term strain has only been exacerbated by the shutdown as advocates grow exceedingly concerned that more cuts could be coming. Close to $1bn in funding cuts have been proposed by the administration, and Rose said there were fears that the administration may argue operations were successful during the shutdown as a way to validate their calls for a smaller workforce. With toilets clean and law enforcement on patrol in popular places like Yosemite, visitor experience has been prioritized while other important NPS responsibilities, including conservation, science and education, remain on the chopping block. “This is a skeleton crew and we have been seeing this from the beginning,” Rose said. “But you can only keep up the facade for so long before major cracks start showing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/yosemite-government-shutdown-national-parks,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e6b6275ab82851ea740a0b02ee3062084687abb/731_0_7920_6336/master/7920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=40ddcac3525820fd4f0bc2bddac2cd83",2025-10-16T12:00:02+00:00,f7fdca2a3e3156dea32f50c658fec1f34fb95838

Atlético broke on a counterattack down the right in the 16th minute, but Fiamma Iannuzzi’s sidefoot shot was blocked by the United captain, Maya Le Tissier. United went in front in the 24th minute when Rolfö crashed in a ­volley at the back post after Julia Zigiotti Olme had swung the ball in from the right.

744557fae4f6,Carter Hart to join Vegas Golden Knights after being acquitted of sexual assault,,"Goaltender Carter Hart has agreed to sign with the Vegas Golden Knights, becoming the first of the five 2018 Canada world junior hockey players to land an NHL contract since they were acquitted of sexual assault in a high-profile case. Vegas announced an agreement with undisclosed terms for Hart on Thursday, the second day after the window opened for the players to sign. Hart and the others are not eligible to play in games until 1 December as part of the league’s reinstatement process for him, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton. “The Golden Knights are aligned with the process and assessment the NHL and NHLPA made in their decision,” the team said in a statement. “We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.” McLeod, who was also found not guilty of an additional charge of being a party to the offense, signed a three-year contract in the Russia-based KHL. Formenton is playing in Switzerland, though it is unclear if he has an out clause to return to the NHL, which he has not played in since 2022 with Ottawa. “Each team is going to have to make its own decision,” commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday after the NHL’s Board of Governors meeting in New York. “They know the rules. And it’s up to them to decide whether or not, subject to those rules, they want to move forward.” Hart is resuming his career at the age of 27 with the Golden Knights after spending his first six seasons playing for Philadelphia. The Flyers last month ruled out bringing back Hart, whose camp communicated to general manager Daniel Briere that a fresh start was a better option. The players were charged in 2024 in connection with an incident in London, Ontario, in 2018. The judge overseeing the trial said the prosecution could not meet the onus of proof to convict them and that complainant’s allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges. The league conducted its own investigation beginning in the spring of 2022 when the allegations came to light. When announcing the reinstatement timeline in September, the NHL called the events that transpired “deeply troubling and unacceptable” and that while they were not found to be criminal, said the players’ conduct did not meet the standard of moral integrity. The NHLPA at the time said the players cooperated with every investigation and considers the matter closed.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/16/carter-hart-signs-vegas-golden-knights-after-2018-canada-junior-case,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b9d49f25b32eba568f1ad4e7a146d47e64e0121/460_0_4596_3679/master/4596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64d8ae5c0a4087aaad2643a3e92411a8",2025-10-16T19:30:23+00:00,2df342f458670606fc69ffff67a0ce2077dbcb8d
93754260af10,Trump moves to push employers on IVF coverage and lower fertility drug costs,,"The Trump administration announced Thursday that it is urging US employers to create new fertility benefit options to cover in vitro fertilization and other infertility treatments. In an announcement from the Oval Office, Donald Trump also said his administration had cut a deal with the drug manufacturer EMD Serono to lower the cost of one of its fertility drugs and list the drug on the government website TrumpRx. These moves, Trump said, would lead to “many more beautiful American children”. “In the Trump administration, we want to make it easier for all couple to have babies, raise children and have the families they’ve always dreamed about,” Trump said. Employers are encouraged to offer the fertility benefit option separately from their medical coverage, similar to how dental and vision coverage is usually offered to employees. The labor department, the treasury and the health department will on Thursday also release guidance on how employers can legally create the option. However, Republicans who spoke at Trump’s announcement framed the benefit as a “recommendation”, indicating that employers will not be required to offer the coverage nor receive government subsidies for doing so. They also stressed that the benefit will be structured to give employers immense flexibility to determine what will or will not be covered. Without new incentives to offer IVF coverage, it is unclear how many employers will ultimately support it. Trump, who has called himself the “fertilization president”, made support for infertility treatments a major part of his re-election campaign, especially after the nation erupted in outrage when the Alabama supreme court deemed embryos “extrauterine children”. Because IVF can lead to the creation of unused or discarded embryos, that decision temporarily forced many Alabama IVF providers to stop working. Yet in the months since taking office, the Trump administration has remained quiet on the issue. In February, he signed an executive order directing the administration’s domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the price tag of IVF, which often costs tens of thousands of dollars and is frequently not covered by insurance. A detailed report on the recommendations was supposed to be made public by May. No report ever emerged. While IVF is extremely popular among Americans, the GOP’s deep ties to the anti-abortion movement have made it something of a political landmine among elected Republicans. The movement has long opposed IVF, as advocates believe that embryos are people. White House officials have in recent months discussed the possibility of supporting restorative reproductive medicine (RRM) , a constellation of therapies that purport to restore people’s “natural” fertility. Although RRM is popular among anti-abortion advocates and adherents of the “make America healthy again” movement, several major medical organizations say there is little quality evidence that RRM is more effective at helping people have babies than mainstream fertility medicine. Trump did not mention RRM in his Thursday address. When a reporter asked if he had any thoughts on anti-abortion activists’ opposition to IVF, Trump said: “I think this is very pro-life.” Pronatalist rhetoric , which holds that having children is important to a county’s wellbeing and that the state should incentivize people to procreate, dominated the press conference that followed Trump’s address. Robert F Kennedy, the health and human services secretary, highlighted the falling US birthrate, while Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, claimed that Kennedy and Trump are “great leaders” because they have big families. People who want more children but can’t have them, Oz added, are “under-babied”. “There’s gonna be a lot of Trump babies,” Oz said. “It turns out the fundamental creative force in society is about making babies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/trump-ivf-announcement,World,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb28973d136cf80d452b0060c7856b34f85be2dd/263_0_3838_3071/master/3838.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b0a6a190db6c96da52fe2368f399a57",2025-10-16T21:08:20+00:00,7f61a979c2b7d8401dd23231afd5e36c97d366e3
8f838104013e,Former Trump adviser John Bolton indicted by justice department,,"A federal grand jury has indicted John Bolton , the former national security adviser in Donald Trump ’s first term, on charges of mishandling and transmitting classified information. The indictment, filed in Maryland , appears to ultimately have been signed off on from career prosecutors in the US attorney’s office there despite initial reluctance to bring a case before the end of the year. The 18-count indictment against Bolton involves eight counts of unlawfully transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining classified information under the Espionage Act, according to the 26-page indictment . The charges nonetheless come at a fraught moment for the justice department, which has been rocked by extraordinary pressure from Trump to expand a vendetta campaign to pursue criminal cases against his political enemies. In recent weeks, Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s handpicked US attorney in Virginia, obtained indictments against James Comey, the former FBI director, and the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, over the objections of career prosecutors. Bolton has been a thorn in Trump’s side for years since he departed the president’s first administration, criticizing him on cable news and assailing him for his own mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club. Part of the criminal investigation into Bolton has focused on what resembled diary entries and private notes he made for himself on an AOL email account – and whether they contained classified information, according to people familiar with the matter. Bolton’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has said the former national security adviser did nothing inappropriate with classified records. and documents with classified markings retrieved from his phone by the FBI were decades old. Bolton, a longtime federal government official with a top secret clearance who was UN ambassador before serving as Trump’s national security adviser from 2018 to 2019, is widely known as a diligent note-taker. After he left the administration in Trump’s first term, Bolton continued to work in Washington and the investigation has examined whether his assistants had access to those notes, the people said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The admiral, Alvin Holsey , just took over the US military’s southern command late last year for a position that normally lasts three years. A source told Reuters that there had been tension between him and Hegseth as well as questions about whether he would be fired in the days leading up to the announcement. The New York Times reports that an unnamed US official said that Holsey “had raised concerns about the mission and the attacks on the alleged drug boats”. Hegseth, in his social media post, did not disclose the reason for Holsey’s plan “to retire at year’s end”. The post noted that Holsey began his career “through the NROTC program at Morehouse College in 1988”. Morehouse is a private, historically Black college in Atlanta.

4a5073ef703b,Warner Bros Discovery says Israeli film boycott ‘violates our policies’,,"Warner Bros Discovery has rebuked a pledge signed by more than 4,000 film industry figures to not work with Israeli film institutions “implicated in the genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”, saying that such a pledge would likely violate its internal policies. In a statement to Variety , a spokesperson said the company “is committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for its employees, collaborators, and other stakeholders”. It continues: “Our policies prohibit discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or ancestry. We believe a boycott of Israeli film institutions violates our policies. While we respect the rights of individuals and groups to express their views and advocate for causes, we will continue to align our business practices with the requirements of our policies and the law.” Industry luminaries including Javier Bardem, Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo signed the pledge, organized and published last month by the group Film Workers for Palestine , that commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. According to the pledge, complicity includes “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”. An FAQ section specified that the pledge, inspired by a boycott of cultural institutions that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa, didn’t prohibit signees from working with Israeli individuals, but targeted national institutions. “The call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” read a statement announcing the pledge. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity. There are also 2 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, and Palestinian civil society has developed context sensitive guidelines for that community.” “We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who have urged the international film industry to refuse silence, racism and dehumanization, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” it added. Days after publication, Paramount became the first studio to respond to the boycott, when Melissa Zukerman, the chief communications officer, said the company did “not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli film-makers”. In a statement, the company, which was recently acquired by the family of billionaire Larry Ellison and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners, said that “the global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world” and that “silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace”. In its own statement, Film Workers for Palestine pointed out Ellison’s close relationship with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and said that the pledge does not target individuals based on their identity, but rather boycotts “complicit Israeli film institutions and companies”. “We sincerely hope that Paramount, in its statement today, isn’t intentionally misrepresenting the pledge in an attempt to silence our colleagues in the film industry,” the organization added. “Such a move would only shield a genocidal regime from criticism at a time when global outrage is exponentially growing and while meaningful steps towards accountability are being taken by many.” Warners Bros Discovery’s rejection of the boycott comes after Variety reported that the group UK Lawyers for Israel sent a legal letter to the UK offices of Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros Discovery and others warning that such a pledge would violate the country’s 2010 Equality Act, making it “highly likely to be a litigation risk”. Separately, 1,200 entertainment figures, including Liev Schreiber, Debra Messing and Mayim Bialik, signed an open letter rejecting the boycott as a “document of misinformation” from artists “misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda”. Last week, Israel and Hamas agreed to the initial phase of a ceasefire , pausing two years of violence in which Israel destroyed more than 90% of homes in Gaza and killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,139 people and taking another 240 hostage.

923d7415fd00,AI might be creating a ‘permanent underclass’ but it’s the makers of the tech bubble who are replaceable,,"Bad news, baby. The New Yorker reports the rapid advance of AI in the workplace will create a “ permanent underclass ” of everyone not already hitched to the AI train. The prediction comes from OpenAI employee Leopold Aschenbrenner, who claims AI will “reach or exceed human capacity” by 2027. Once it develops capacity to innovate, AI superintelligence will supersede even a need for its own programmers … and then wipe out the jobs done by everyone else. Nate Soares, winner of “most sunshine in book title” and co-author of AI critique If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies suggests “people should not be banking on work in the long term”. Math tutors, cinematographers, brand strategists and journalists are quoted by the New Yorker, freaking out. The consolation here is that if you are among those panicking about being forced into the permanent underclass, you are already in it. Inherited wealth makes more billionaires than entrepreneurship , the opportunity gap is growing; if your family don’t have the readies to fund your tech startup , media empire or eventual presidential ambitions , it’s probably because they were in a tech-displaced underclass, too. My own family were agrarian stablehands before industrialisation drove them to work in the Glasgow shipyards. After industrial decline there, they migrated south into retail clerkery. My dad worked in betting shops that have been replaced by apps. My mum was an admin assistant whose tasks you can now run from an iPhone. So if this column is replaced by the burps of a machine programmed to deliver cultural trend-based leftist snark, I’ll be following family tradition. Spinning jennies, combine harvesters, electrification, trains, cars, recording, computers and, presumably, the wheel – given visible lack of sedan chairs – have all devastated industries and with them, people. How well we cope with that devastation is the opportunity of the hour, and you don’t need a machine to conclude unionisation is the remedy. Pals, we’ve been here before. When automation hit the Japanese carmaking industry in the 1970s, its unions successfully fought for “ cooperative modernisation ”, with job security guarantees and lifelong retraining programs. With technological progress replacing many of their functions, throughout the 1980s Australian nurses fought attacks to reduce their status and instead bargained to enhance their productivity through tertiary training with the new technologies – a victory that improved both their work conditions and professional standing. We are already seeing industrial unions take the fight to AI . The Writers Guild of America strike in 2023 resulted in an agreement that determined writers wouldn’t be replaced by generative AI as source material, or be compelled to use it – but would be at liberty to use AI as a productivity tool at their own writerly discretion, compliant with company policies. The opportunity to stand up for our AI-threatened livelihoods is now, because – despite the relentless insistence of tech’s grifters, zealots and cheerleaders – AI is not industrially inevitable. At present, it’s not even sustainable. While AI data centre construction skyrockets , there are costs emerging even beyond the energy and water required to power and maintain them. Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman from hedge fund Praetorian Capital calculates the physical depreciation of these centres may be as rapid as three years. “No one understands,” was the quote collected by Futurism , “how the financial math is supposed to work.” Not investors, with the majority of responders to a Bank of America survey admitting concern that AI stocks were in a bubble . Not the Bank of England , who’ve warned of a potential “sudden correction” in worldwide markets as it raised concerns about the soaring company valuations. Not MIT , whose own maths have revealed that 95% of corporate clients trialling AI pilots or initiatives find zero – or negligible – return, or Carnegie Mellon University, who released a paper showing AI agents failed to complete basic office tasks about 70% of the time. Not TechRepublic, reporting that 55% of surveyed companies that sacked workers to replace them with automation now regret the decision . Analytics firm Orgvue also found that layoffs cost the companies $1.27 for every $1 saved by the sacking . It sure makes the claim by professional tech patsy Nick Clegg that paying copyright on AI’s stolen content through a model such as a local library can manage would “basically kill” the industry revealing. Not paying for a product you exploit to sell your product is theft; not paying for labour you employ is slavery. If your business model is theft and slavery, you’re not an industry. You’re a pirate. Perhaps this is techno-cynicism. Or perhaps, this week, OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, announced a ChatGPT upgrade with tits . Ahoy! It’s some comfort that those who would casually erase our jobs at least cater to our entertainment. For my amusement, I used AI to create and automate a “ techbro bot ” that generates social media posts as a techlord, informed by a dataset of public statements by same.

I whiled away the three-minute journey reading deeply into the subject. There were a couple of operators on board, which seemed a bit excessive under the circumstances, so I took the opportunity to bombard them with questions. I felt bad about asking this, but I wondered whether, when they were growing up wanting to be train drivers, this was quite what they had in mind. “Well, the thing is,” said one of them, “I never really wanted to be a train driver in the first place.” I couldn’t think of anything to say to that. Otherwise they conveyed nothing but pride in their work, shuttling hundreds of thousands of passengers in and out of the town every year. They told me that as well as being the shortest line, it was also pretty steep, what with its 1-in-67 gradient. And, they said, they go back and forth no fewer than 214 times a day. “It is a bit repetitive,” one of them conceded. Later I read that the Germans are now laying claim to having the shortest railway line in all of Europe. It clocks in at barely half a mile and runs from Friedrichshafen Stadt to Friedrichshafen Hafen, and by the time you’ve said all that out loud the journey must be almost over. Fair play, but I award my home town a moral victory here. Because as far as I can see, the train between Friedrichshafen Stadt and Friedrichshafen Hafen only makes about 70 journeys a day. Small potatoes! Or kleine Kartoffeln, as they probably don’t say in Germany. Stourbridge’s 200-plus daily runs plainly knock Friedrichshafen’s efforts into a cocked hat.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2025/oct/16/shortest-railway-line-in-britain-stourbridge,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f33cb3069ae21b835a712f4b85a0fbe6c24e29/0_135_4512_3609/master/4512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=13bb58022a58450e37ac29bd1a8f539a",2025-10-16T10:00:03+00:00,c8869db70a777f380d88048f75837b2489df0f61

420fea06565d,"‘When I pass piles of fishing nets, I see piles of money’: a one man recycling revolution on the Cornish coast",,"I an Falconer kept thinking about the heaps of discarded plastic fishing nets he saw at Newlyn harbour near his home in Cornwall. “I thought ‘it’s such a waste’,” he says. “There has to be a better solution than it all going into landfill.” Falconer, 52, who studied environmental and mining geology at university, came up with a plan: shredding and cleaning the worn out nets, melting the plastic down and converting it into filament to be used in 3D printing. He then built a “micro-factory” so that the filament could be made into useful stuff. “Every year, up to 1m tonnes of fishing nets are discarded,” he says. “Most of that ends up in landfill or is burned, or worse still finds its way back into the oceans. This showed there was another way for some of that material.” The first big challenge he encountered when he started in 2016, was getting hold of the nets. But he badgered the Newlyn harbour master into giving him a few to test his theory in his kitchen. From old nets to new glasses – one of the many products made from the waste plastic. Photograph: OrCA Since its launch the following year, Falconer’s company OrCA (previously Fishy Filaments) has raised more than £1m from small investors in over 40 countries. The investment funded the development of patented new machinery that can convert more than 20 kilos of nylon fishing nets an hour. He claims the recycling process has less than 3% of the carbon impact of producing new nylon. “When they get to us, this particular type of fishing nets have typically been used by Cornish fishers for around six months,” he says. “They are routinely swapped out because their surfaces become cloudy due to wear and the build up of an algal biofilm. With time and repeated use, eventually the fish can sense them in the water and avoid them. “Skippers can see their catches fall as their nets age and it makes sense to replace them.” Falconer sorts through bags of nets at his Newlyn headquarters. Photograph: OrCA The nets that go into the shredder come out as small blue-green beads that Falconer sells to 3D printing companies, which convert them into strings of filament used in 3D printing. They also get sold around the world to replace new plastic in more conventional products that are made using injection moulding. Falconer’s shipping container office is full of items made from the raw material: sunglasses, light shades, bottle openers, razor blade handles. It can be used for just about anything. The items he is most proud of are those made from his nylon mixed with waste carbon fibre – mostly from offcuts of car and aeroplane manufacturing. This stronger and more expensive product is used to make parts for racing bikes and super-light sunglasses, and industrial components such as electronic enclosures. Small blue-green beads are produced by shredding old nets. These are then converted into strings of filament used in 3D printing. Photograph: OrCA The carbon and nylon mix sells for up to £35,000 a tonne – more than the £12,000 a tonne pure nylon beads. “Our process turns a liability of about £500 a tonne to pay to get someone to take the nets away, not to mention the environmental cost of that, into something of real value,” Falconer says. “Now, when I pass the piles of fishing nets on the harbourside, I see piles of money.” Abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear poses one of the most serious threats to marine life, says Rachel Coppock, marine ecologist at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, adding that innovative ideas to reduce this are welcome. “Recycling schemes are increasingly seen as viable and beneficial in demonstrating how old gear can be transformed into new products, reducing landfill waste and supporting a circular economy,” she says. “Though challenges remain in scaling these efforts due to material complexity and infrastructure gaps.” Falconer’s roster of clients, which includes Philips lighting, L’Oréal, Ford and Mercedes-Benz, is increasing as more companies see OrCA’s potential to help them reduce their carbon footprint by increasing the proportion of their products made from recycled materials. Waste fishing nets are a problem in Cornwall, but are a much bigger problem in countries without established waste systems “The European Union wants automakers to use at least 20% recycled plastic by 2035 ,” he says. “Using ours is one of the easiest ways to do it.” Falconer could make a nice living continuing to recycle Newlyn fishers’ nets, but he has wider ambitions. “Waste fishing nets are a problem here in Cornwall, but the same type of nets are a much bigger problem in other countries, especially those without established waste systems,” he says. “Around Africa, South and Central America and Asia you see these nets littering beaches.” Many of those countries don’t have the equipment to recycle the nets, he says, so they are burned or just left as waste. “They even end up back in the water where they can damage coral reefs and harm marine life, including the fisheries that the local communities rely on for food.” A shaving set that has been 3D printed from recycled fishing nets. Photograph: OrCA About 150,000 tonnes of nylon monofilament fishing nets are made every year, and, based on external reports, Falconer estimates production will soon rise to 200,000 tonnes. The world’s total traditional nylon recycling capacity is less than 150,000 tonnes a year, so less than half the capacity that European carmakers need to meet their targets, and almost all of that is taken up with recycling carpets and other textiles. To try to combat the problem, Falconer plans on exporting his recycling solution to any harbour that wants it. A container with all the equipment needed to run a mini recycling plant would cost about $500,000 (£370,000) if built in the UK. Falconer says he has already received inquiries from 14 countries including Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, South Africa and Vietnam. “The beauty of it is that it all fits in a shipping container and pretty much anyone can operate it,” he says. “So you could have one of these at every harbour around the world, converting a costly and hazardous waste into a profitable raw material.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/16/fishing-nets-money-a-one-man-recycling-revolution-on-the-cornish-coast,Business,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2efc66ab110e70dff8126b32a5fa30e8a518ebe2/202_1209_4012_3208/master/4012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5423a36f4a884c012a3afb35e67b562",2025-10-16T04:00:57+00:00,6fdc421d7fabffff559e00d72a9667f0f0676a68

According to a trademark application, MrBeast is planning to expand into the world of finance There might be eight more years before YouTube superstar MrBeast can officially run for President of the United States, but that doesn’t mean the creator is sitting idle. The YouTube stunt king , also known by his government name Jimmy Donaldson, is toying with plans to open his own financial service, according to a trademark application. Donaldson filed an application with the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office for a service called MrBeast Financial on Oct. 13.  The application description says the new name is for “mobile app and online services for a range of banking , financial advisory, crypto exchange, and other services,” an expansion into finance that matches the creator’s fervor to continually incorporate his brand into every facet of the American business world. According to Business Insider , Donaldson’s company Beast Industries pitched investors the idea of credit cards, loans, and cryptocurrency alongside a creator-focused platform to help others achieve his YouTube success. With 446 million followers on his main YouTube channel alone, Donaldson is the world’s most subscribed YouTuber of all time . Since Donaldson first began posting videos in 2011, he’s gone from a one-off stunt video maker to one of the driving forces in the creator ecosystem — his most viral videos revolving around pushing people to do a range of goofy to borderline-dangerous stunts for life-changing amounts of cold hard cash. In addition to constantly manufacturing attention grabbing videos like “100 Kids Vs. World’s Strongest Man!” “Survive 100 Days In Nuclear Bunker, Win $500,000” and “I Spent 50 Hours Buried Alive,” Donaldson has also expanded into the food world with his burger brand MrBeast Burgers, the chocolate company Feastables, and a lunch kit called Lunchly. “I want to be the biggest YouTube channel ever,” he told Rolling Stone in a 2022 cover story . “Not even for my ego. I don’t know. I just want it. It just gives me something to strive for, to get out of bed and grind for. But it’s also just vanity.” There’s no additional information about when MrBeast Financial will be available for Donaldson’s fans to use — and representatives for Donaldson declined to comment to Rolling Stone — which means MrBeast fans may have more time to wait before they can get their favorite YouTuber to give them a line of credit.

59dd92a03728,Blue Moon review – Ethan Hawke is terrific in Richard Linklater’s bitter Broadway breakup drama,,"B reaking up with the more prominent partner in a showbiz double act is a hazardous business. Larry David did it. So did Andrew Ridgeley. Now this witty and heartbreakingly sad chamber piece from screenwriter Robert Kaplow and director Richard Linklater tells the all but unbearable story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart just after his split from Richard Rodgers. He is played with campy brilliance, an unspeakable combover and fake smallness by Ethan Hawke, who is often digitally reduced in size – but is also occasionally filmed standing in an off-camera hole to look up poignantly at taller characters, facing Hart’s vertical challenge as José Ferrer once played the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec. Hawke gets big, world-weary laughs with Hart’s riffs on the hidden gayness of the movie Casablanca and the cheesily upbeat musical he’s just been to see, with all the lasso-twirling cowboys; he acidly calls it Okla-homo. The sexual identity of Hart is complex: this film effectively triangulates his gayness with the straight persona invented for him in the 1948 musical Words and Music (with Mickey Rooney playing Hart); it cleverly extrapolates a kind of bisexuality from Hart’s letters to his protege: young Yale student and would-be stage designer Elizabeth Weiland, played here with heedless girlishness by Margaret Qualley . As part of the legendary Broadway songwriting team with composer Rodgers, Hart was responsible for matchless numbers like The Lady Is a Tramp, Manhattan, My Funny Valentine and of course Blue Moon. But exasperated with Hart’s alcoholism, unreliability and depressive outbursts, Rodgers broke with him and partnered with Oscar Hammerstein II to write Oklahoma! and then a raft of stage and screen smashes. The movie imagines the deeply depressed Hart in Oklahoma!’s first-night New York audience in 1943, looking on with envious despair as the show proceeds, despising its bland sentimentality, hating the exclamation mark at the end of the title, but heartsinkingly aware of how lethally effective it is. He knows a hit when he sees one – and feels himself descending into failure. Even before the interval, Hart miserably ducks out and heads to the bar at Sardi’s where the rest of the film takes place, and waits for the (inevitably) triumphant Oklahoma! company to show up for their after-party. He knows it is his showbiz duty to congratulate Rodgers, to pretend everything is all right. With suave restraint, Andrew Scott plays Rodgers, clearly embarrassed at what they both know is Hart’s humiliation; he offers a sop to his pride in the form of a short-term gig writing new numbers for their existing show A Connecticut Yankee, which only makes it worse. Bobby Cannavale plays the barman who in traditional style listens sympathetically to Hart’s arias of vinegary despair; Patrick Kennedy plays EB White, to whom Hart accidentally gives the idea for his children’s book Stuart Little; and Qualley plays Weiland, the unattainably beautiful Yale student with whom the film imagines Hart to be complicatedly and self-harmingly in love. Hart has already been jilted by Rodgers. Surely the universe can’t be so cruel as to get him jilted by Weiland as well? But Qualley ruthlessly portrays a young woman who wants Hart to be the giggly, sexually unthreatening intimate to whom she can confide her adventures with boys – as well of course the Broadway power broker who can further her career. Hawke shows that Hart partly takes voyeuristic pleasure in hearing about these boys but he is also genuinely, tragically besotted with Weiland and the movie tells us about something rarely touched on in films about the world of musical theatre or the movies: the terrible overlap between professional and romantic failure. Yet at some level, Hart is defiantly aware that what he has achieved will survive. It’s a terrific performance from Hawke. This could be a stage musical – but who will write the songs?",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/16/blue-moon-review-ethan-hawke-richard-linklater-broadway-hart-rodgers,Culture,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9abe8fdb54fe84606249bcd6c38e2f24f87d00fe/548_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=44f0984cfc4fc85bbc3325eb534c6a6c",2025-10-16T20:15:51+00:00,7627f75faea50cbd2c5310fd1ecbbaac6c74597d

Daniel Birtwistle, 39, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, appeared by video link at Dudley magistrates court on Thursday morning, where he spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. He has been charged in relation to the death of 24-year-old Georgina Ward, a “brilliant, creative and talented” tattoo artist, who was found dead at her Dudley home in November 2020. As well as the charge of manslaughter, Birtwistle has been charged with two counts of controlling and coercive behaviour and three counts of assault in relation to Ward, which allegedly occurred between August 2019 and November 2020. Birtwistle is charged with further offences, including controlling and coercive behaviour in relation to three other women.

Her capacity for empathy, and compassion towards people, animals and those less fortunate, was immeasurable. “She was a protector, a voice for the voiceless and a beacon of love in a world that often forgets the importance of kindness. “Georgina will be forever remembered and loved for her funny, caring nature and being unapologetically herself. “Our lives have been changed irrevocably by her loss, and she is missed beyond measure, which is an absolute testament to the person she was.

7238bf68ca7f,Sam Fender wins 2025 Mercury prize for his album People Watching,,"Sam Fender is the winner of the 2025 Mercury prize , for his chart-topping album People Watching. Announcing the award, Sian Eleri, BBC radio DJ and one of the judges on the judging panel, said the album was characterised by “cohesion, character and ambition. It felt like a classic album, one that will take pride of place in record collections for years to come.” Fender, 31, grew up in North Shields, close to where the award ceremony was held this year, in Newcastle . He broke through quickly with his debut album Hypersonic Missiles in 2019, which topped the UK album chart, then consolidated its epic yet poignant sound on second album Seventeen Going Under (2021), and again with People Watching, released in February. It has taken him to even greater commercial heights, producing two Top 10 singles and prompting a series of stadium concerts. Accepting the award to the sound of Newcastle United chants in the crowd, Fender said: “We did not expect this at all … I want to say thank you, because I never did, to the person the song People Watching is about: Annie Orwin, who’s up there.” Fender has previously described Orwin, an actor, as “like a surrogate mother” to him, and the lyrics of the song People Watching reflect on his visits to see her in the care home where she eventually died in 2023. He performed the song at the ceremony. This year’s Mercury prize shortlist featured a number of commercially successful albums alongside somewhat lesser-known names. People Watching, Wolf Alice’s The Clearing and Pulp’s comeback album More all topped the UK album chart, while CMAT’s Euro-Country, FKA twigs’ Eusexua, Fontaines DC’s Romance and PinkPantheress’s Fancy That all reached the Top 3. Bookmakers had CMAT as the favourite, followed by Fontaines DC and Pulp. Also nominated were Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon, rapper Pa Salieu, jazz-funk artist Emma-Jean Thackray, and Welsh jazz pianist Joe Webb. Martin Carthy on the Mercury prize’s red carpet. Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty Images The prize also had its oldest ever nominee: English folk singer Martin Carthy , 84, recognised for his album Transform Me Then Into a Fish. Carthy’s career stretches back to the early 1960s London, where he influenced Bob Dylan, teaching him the standard Scarborough Fair. He later made recordings with his wife, Norma Waterson, and their daughter Eliza Carthy followed them into folk music, earning two Mercury prize nominations of her own in 1998 and 2003. Martin and Eliza performed a version of Scarborough Fair together, with sitar player Sheema Mukherjee, at the ceremony. Alon, Fender, FKA twigs , Pulp, Salieu, Thackray, Webb and Wolf Alice each also performed a song live. CMAT was also in attendance, but did not perform due to recent treatment to two wisdom teeth. “I was thinking about making jewellery from them,” she told BBC 6 Music. “I want to make the other nominees kiss my teeth for good luck, but not tell them it’s my good luck.” Wolf Alice became the first act to be nominated for each of their first four albums. Both they and Pulp have one win from four nominations. In 2024, the Mercury prize seemed to be in a somewhat parlous state, after it failed to secure an event sponsor and had to make do with a scaled-back awards show without live performances. But it has returned strongly in 2025, relocating to Newcastle and using the city’s Utilita Arena as a venue. It also hosted an array of “Mercury fringe” events in the days prior to the award ceremony, with artist showcases, workshops and panel discussions. Guardian analysis of recent winners found that between 2014 and 2023, every winner hailed from London, with Leeds band English Teacher finally bringing a win from outside the capital in 2024. The move to Newcastle, which helps to counter a generally London-centric music industry, has therefore been praised. Ian Murray, minister for creative industries, media and arts, said the “symbolic step” was “hugely welcome … for too long other regions have had to play second fiddle to London, despite having world-class creative output in their own right”. Sam Fender and band celebrate their win. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA The Mercury prize is voted for by a team of music industry figures: jazz musician and broadcaster Jamie Cullum; radio DJs Sian Eleri, Jamz Supernova, Mistajam, and Danielle Perry; journalists Phil Alexander, Will Hodgkinson and Sophie Williams; music consultant Lea Stonhill; and the chair of the judges, Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC Radio 2 and Radio 6 Music. The prize, founded in 1992, is described as a “celebration of the 12 albums of the year, recognising artistic achievement across a range of contemporary music genres”. The most nominated artists are Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys, each with five, while PJ Harvey is the only artist to have won it twice. Fender wins £25,000 prize money.

fe946289d9ee,Arsenal enjoy their Lisbon return as Mead and Russo see off Benfica in WCL,,"Arsenal’s midfielder Mariona Caldentey said “almost everything” needs to be better after a laboured defeat of Benfica secured the holders’ first win of the Champions League campaign. Beth Mead sent the ball crawling over the line in the second half after a scramble in the box and Alessia Russo killed off the game with their second in Portugal. It was not pretty in the Estádio da Luz, but it was enough, just, with Arsenal’s lack of cutting edge remaining a major concern. “Really happy because we have won. It’s not easy to come here after losing the first game, so it was really important for us. At the same time, we need to be better,” Caldentey told Disney+. Asked what they need to be better at she said: “Almost everything. We need to be more consistent ­defensively and we have so much quality up front that we should score more goals. “It’s not one or two players, it’s all of us. Football is about momentum and sometimes it’s hard to change that dynamic.” The return to the city of their heroic underdog triumph over Barcelona in the Champions League final in May, this time in Benfica’s home instead of Sporting CP’s José Alvalade Stadium, was shrouded in far less optimism this time round. Then, Arsenal fans had travelled with hopes tempered, given the scale of the task, but spirits high, after a stellar run to their second final. This time, the side that arrived in Lisbon was a more beleaguered one after a disappointing start to a season full of promise. The Gunners have dropped seven points in their opening six WSL games and went four games without a win, including a 2-1 loss in their ­Champions League opener against Lyonnes, before Sunday’s less than convincing 1-0 win over Brighton halted that frustrating run. There were several changes to the team that earned the win on Sunday, including Lotte Wubben-Moy coming in for the 19-year-old centre-back Katie Reid, who has a groin injury. In the first half, the story was a familiar one, Arsenal dominated possession, accruing almost 70%, but failed to make that count, a cutting edge in the final third mysteriously missing with Benfica matching them with five shots and bettering them two on target to Arsenal’s none. It would take a bit of chaos in Benfica’s area to give Arsenal the lead after the break, Caldentey’s cross towards Mead in the middle pinballed off Beatriz Cameirão before Diana Gomes and Mead got touches in with the latter doing enough to send it rolling slowly over the line. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The exit of Emily Fox and Steph Catley with ­different injury concerns only added to Arsenal’s woes. The longer the game wore on with the teams separated by one goal the livelier the home side looked, ­sensing they could take something from the game, but Arsenal got a second to see out the final minutes under less pressure, Russo turning in from Chloe Kelly’s low free-kick – their second shot on target. Arsenal were relieved, although they have some work to do, and Benfica were buoyed up by their performance. “The result is not positive, it’s a loss, but the performance was great,” said their manager, Ivan Baptista, speaking to Disney+. “The result was open until the 90th minute, not everyone can do that against Arsenal.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/16/benfica-arsenal-womens-champions-league-match-report,Sport,the guardians,,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1671ed4e59ddacae4a5a02395d950f563ce4b01/0_0_3233_2587/master/3233.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=700b0f3241bfa3dec1d0cbf5fdc868cf",2025-10-16T21:06:20+00:00,6d2bcc51e4e5945b1e4f4ab526dcf17af5471eea
